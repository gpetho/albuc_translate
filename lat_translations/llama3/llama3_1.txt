Praefatio.	Here is the translation:
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After completing this book for you, my sons, and finishing the last part of the science of medicine with its completion, and following its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, namely surgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because the operation with hand is lying prostrate in our region and time, and entirely private until perhaps it will perish along with its knowledge, and the track of it will be cut off: and there are left from it only small descriptions in ancient books which have been altered by hands: and errors and hesitation occur to them until their intentions are closed and the power of it is gone. It seemed to me that I should bring it back to life with the arrangement of this Treatise in accordance with the method of position, declaration, and abbreviation: and that I may come along with the forms of iron instruments Cauterii and other tools of the work: when it happens through the addition of declaration and due proportion which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	But the reason why a good craftsman of that kind is not found with his own hand in our present time is: because the art of medicine is long and requires its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galenus narrated, until he knows the benefits of members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, and their number, and their exit and return, and the pulsating and quiet veins, and the exit places of those.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about him at the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because whoever is not knowing what we have said about anatomy does not escape, but rather falls into error, by which people are killed: just as I have seen many of those who claim to be knowledgeable in this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a stupid doctor cut open a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and lacerate some arteries in her neck. Therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead under his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from an old man's bladder, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore came to him and removed it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land in exchange for his medicine; and it happened to the black eunuch who was with him that he broke his leg near the heel. And the doctor hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with poultices, and bandages tightly tightened, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	After that he let him go after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and it stood thus until his leg and foot became gangrened and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and as a result there was calmness, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already set in on the member; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to spread through the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after some days until its evil quality was greatly magnified with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is this? Because when the cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it should not be approached at all with iron, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, oh sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions with hand: namely, an operation which is accompanied by salvation, and an operation where there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up everywhere in this book, where the operation comes, in which there is fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of this and leave it alone, lest foolish people find a way to speak and be ashamed.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take measurement with solicitude and protection, and treat your weak patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading to salvation and praiseworthy succession through the grace of God; and leave off dreadful griefs difficult to cure: and lift up your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your possessions.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galenus indeed said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You will not heal bad illness: lest you be called evil doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	However, I have now divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp medicine, divided and arranged from head to feet, and the forms of instruments and tools of cauterization, and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning section and perforation, bleeding and ventosities, wounds: and extracting arrows and similar ones: and the whole chapter, arranged in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar ones: chaptered, arranged from head to feet, and in forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Chapter on the Use and Harm of Cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before that, I must first recall the nature of its usefulness and harm, and in which complexion it is exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of the usefulness and harm of Cautery is a lengthy and subtle one, requiring knowledge and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken on this subject and disagreed among themselves. And as for me, I am content with a little of their words, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that Cautery agrees with all complexions, both those with matter and those without matter, except for two complexions which are hot without matter and dry without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the complexions of heat and dryness with matter, they disagreed among themselves.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that Cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite of this, namely that Cautery is not suitable in an illness which arises from heat and dryness; for since fire's nature is heat, it is incongruous to heal a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And the one who said the opposite of this has said that through Cautery a benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies; for when you compare the body of a man and his humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say this through his discourse; because through experience it has revealed itself to me on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not proper that someone should come to attend to that unless he has already been tested and trained in the last exercise of Cauterization, and has known the diversity of human temperaments, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the time span of these.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear for the other temperaments from you, especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all physicians have agreed on these matters and do not disagree with cauterization in treating them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that from the secret of healing by means of cauterization with fire and the excellence of it combined with medicine that burns: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the part that is being cauterized, and does not harm another connected member unless a small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of the medicine that burns reaches what is distant from the member, and perhaps makes an illness of difficult healing occur in another member, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	And now it has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and standing on the truth of things: and because of that, I excuse myself from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not allowed to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in expelling diseases from bodies, by which it drives out illnesses through philosophical demonstration, which would be clarified in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they themselves disagree on the time when it is proper to perform cauterization, and hold that a better time is that of truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is fitting at any time: therefore, because the harm that occurs due to time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterizing instrument is for pains that are necessary, strong, and stubborn, which do not tolerate delay: therefore, because one fears from them that a greater harm may occur than slight damage done during the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, my sons, that which is not esteemed by those people and foolish doctors, namely, that the illness which is cured through cauterization does not always return: and they place this consequence, and it is not as they think. Therefore, because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and exhausts the humors that are the causes why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superfluous over medicine because of the speed and power of its own operation and the intensity of its dominion: and it is possible that illness returns after some time, according to the complexion of the infirm person, and the location of their illness, and the power of its cause: and what is prepared in their body from an accumulation of excesses within them: and what reaches them through food and similar things from their causes, unless there is a condition where cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a few excesses and humors of the member, such as tooth cauterization for pain, and similar ones, it is possible that the pain does not return in that one.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common people's talk is again, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, and their speech is correct: not with regard to what they intend in it; because they believe that there is no cure which compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing itself is contrary to that and their intention, because cauterization is the last resort of medicine not because when we administer modes of healing in some illness, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of things, and it helps; so it becomes clear that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding which the common people and many foolish doctors have.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients have said that a cauterium with gold is better than one with iron: and they did not say this unless for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance. And they said that a cauterium does not make pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cauterium with this is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you put the cauterium with gold into fire, it is not revealed to you how much heat you want, because of the redness of the gold: and when it's cooling down, and if you add more ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into occupation with that, and because of this, we make a cauterium with iron for ourselves faster and closer to the operation, according to its straightness.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have already arranged this chapter on cauterium according to chapters: and I arranged it from head to foot, so that the one seeking may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Chapter On the Method of Cauterizing the Head at the Crown Commisure.
Caput II.	Book Two.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cauterization serves to counteract the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of swelling, and the abundance of fluid flux from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally all kinds of illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones among those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you precede the patient by administering a purgative medicine to cleanse the head for three nights or four, according to how much the patient's strength requires, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then tell him to make his head bald with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with an inkstone.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive cauter to fire, which has this shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with an inkstone, while you slowly withdraw your hand and turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift up your left hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	What if you see that a quantity of bone from the skull or a quantity of zeuberi has already been exposed, then lift up your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with the same iron or another one that is not chilled; until you see the bones which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, and pour it on the wound, and put it over the place; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put the soaked cotton on top of the butter, and leave it over the place until the scab is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment of tetrapharmakon, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus is emitted; therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone, and the cautery held until something thickened like bone is burnt.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape off after what has been burned away from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to arrive at the end with a cautery, so that it impresses on the bone an imprint like a form of kyrate: or an instrument which women put in infusion of small letters, and they think that vapors of the head escape from this place, and that the wound remains open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it will be treated until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me these two species of cauterization seem to be entirely useless except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better for him to leave with his own safety than to be treated by me.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, just as we have testified in other limbs; and especially when an invalid's head is naturally weak. And indeed, the first species of cauterization is more safe and better for me to use, and I employ it: therefore I will work with it for the sake of salvation.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the manner of cauterizing the head when the whole head is in pain.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head and it is prolonged in an invalid, and he uses herbs, and poultices, and purgatives, and oils, and embrocations.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cauterization, which we have narrated, and brings him no relief from those things: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if an invalid's head is strong and natural, and not weak, and it finds a moderate coldness: then cauterize with another cauterization under that slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over the whole horn of his own head with a cauterization, so that it does not penetrate the skin and opens up from the bone the quantity which we have narrated.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cauterization at the back of his own head, in the place which is called the "vas": and this is the location where the "ventosa" is placed; and elevate your mat there, and do not open up the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For an invalid finds that because of this pain is very intense and different from the pains of all other cauterizations on the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this about the Cauterion in its place; and it is necessary that it be a cauterization by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head is cauterized more finely with a cauterization by which the middle part of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in a headache, both with burnt medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur on the head, or when the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purging medicines, and the rest of the treatment, which I mentioned in the divisions of afflictions, is administered, but that does not provide a complete cure: then cauterization is done in this case by two methods: either with medicine that burns sharply, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with sharp-burning medicine is this: you take a single tooth of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the painful area with a broad lancet at the proper time, until there is a spot beneath the skin where the tooth is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the spot beneath the skin until it is hidden: then tie a cloth over it with a gentle constriction and let it be for fifteen hours. Then release it, extract the garlic, and let it sit for two or three days afterwards. Afterwards, place a poultice submerged in butter on top of it until the area becomes pus-filled. Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines which I wrote about in the 12th treatise, On Blistering Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron is done according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire Cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clavilis, because the form of its head is like the form of a hook, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the spot and hold your hand steady. And you should turn the iron slowly with speed, and let the part that is burned be as thick as the skin's middle portion.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift up your hand so that the artery which is below is not burned, and a flow of blood may occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cloth in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days. Then put the cloth with butter; afterwards care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the extremity of a second-edged cauterizing knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into an artery in this headache, not properly old-fashioned.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in ancient headache.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a headache, following what we said earlier in the previous treatment and in the divisions of illnesses, and the cure does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire is not enough for him, then it is necessary to use the Ignias Cauterium with a knife, until it becomes white after you have marked above the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger or so: and put your hand on one side, and tie it tight until you cut into the artery and reach the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone which moves during mastication, lest it be burned or the nerve that moves it, whereby a spasms may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and take care to prevent bleeding from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is fear in its severing, and especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and not studious or experienced: and he abandons the operation at once.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regulation of bleeding from an artery according to its own manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that from sickness a wound is not being healed by this cautery, and you see the sick person bearing with patience the cautery in the middle of their head, just as we have narrated, then treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the manner of cauterizing in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is cured with salves and the rest of the treatment we mentioned in the division, but the pain does not depart, then apply the fire cautery: and that is what is called a Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make the point with it after its ignition on the entire circumference of the ear, as it revolves; or on the circumference of both, if the pain is simultaneously present in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch out with the cautery from the root of the ear for a little bit, after you have marked the places with wax: and let the length of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then cure the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured by cauterization is not excepting those species which occur from phlegm, according to what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And having applied the cautery to the species that occurs from dryness and nervous spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hyssop, and powdering the head, and gargling, and your treatment does not bring relief, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than that, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterizer on the contrary side of the weaker part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless it happens in a part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it directly at the tip of the upper ear, a little below the horn of the head: and afterwards, as long as the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cauterizer until it burns a quantity equal to the thickness of half the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cauterizer, and it is a kind of small knife, whose shape is as follows: although it is not much finer than what you see: and it should be so that the knife is a little above the excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what preceded: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the manner of cauterizing in Ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient apoplexy sets in and you treat it as we have said, and your treatment does not take effect, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizers on top of his entire head, and one in the middle of his head, as we have said, and another at the back of his head, according to what has preceded: and the manner of cauterizing is according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And also cauterize with the cauterizer above the mouth of the stomach: and this is the final one.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then quickly dress the entire head of the patient and place on the back of his head an ointment made from vinegar, as described in the treatise on ointments: and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the correct method of cauterization; and do that in the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If it is then healed through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauterizations on the back of his head, which are descended from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and put between every cauterization the thickness of a finger.

Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish to add more and he is weak and endures this: then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	What if you want to add more: then cauterize it above both horns.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the infirm person: afterwards cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and a cauterization above every horn of the head, and a cauterization above the back of it, and three over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are desirous of a remedy for the softening of the body and the infirm person endures it and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and the last one along with a cauterization, until most of it is burned off from the skin, and lift up your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed: and thus anoint with oil.

Therefore, it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first with myrrh and with the other cure which we mentioned in the division; when he is very weak or is enduring in the acceptance of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargling substance and cleansing chewings are administered to purify the brain, many days beforehand with the improvement of food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then quickly shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has gone before; and another cautery on the back of his head, and above all the horn of his own head.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excessiveness tending towards melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid and weakened, then give him to drink what will purify his brain, according to what went before in the division: afterwards quickly shave the head of the patient, and make a bandage after that, well-made from linen, like a circle.

Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cautery him above both temples with two cauteries, if there is an onset of water flowing down from both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an onset of water flowing down from one eye: and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in breadth equal to the temples: and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	And if you see anything from that, then cut him off immediately with any medicine possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and caution against blood flow.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent: and they are above the veins and arteries which are visible on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that this is from excesses of cold and phlegmatic things. Then cauterize with the same cauterization that I described in the beginning of the flowing water, cauterizing in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations above the temples, and two cauterizations on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if there is need of addition, then cauterize it on all sides cautiously around the eye, above the outer corner of the eyebrow with a small cauter.

When you are treating that with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not agree: then hasten and give three infusions of vinegar to drink for three nights. Then gently massage his head, and cauterize it with a medium cauterization, with olive oil cauterization.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauterizations on all sides: and draw back from the two temples: and let the length of the entire cauterization be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not leave your hand with the cauterizer, but rather according to the quantity that is burned off the third eyelid.

Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in this case according to two modes: either a burning cautery with fire; or a burning cautery with medicinal combustion.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in the burning cautery with fire, first instruct the patient beforehand to remove their hair if they are one of those who pluck it, until it is lengthened and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they prick him at the beginning of his growth: then bind up his eyes with a bandage, so that they may not be moved until they are developed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are developed and equalized, then place the patient's head in your bosom: afterwards mark on the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, marking it so that it is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the cooled cautery in white of egg or in psillium mucus on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then set fire to the cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize above the figure which you marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, appears properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs raised at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So lift up your hand then, and let him go three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on top of it a compress with butter, until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	What if some hair returns after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization over that place, just as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however hairs are on the lower part: then cauterize it, until it is raised to its natural place: and it will be equal so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to make a person take out the hairs until they are lengthened and equalized.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from cloth of linen the shape of a mulberry leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unimbibed chalk one ounce or almost that much: then mix them together with good rubbing and make it quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread it over the cloth which you made in the shape of a mulberry leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one eye, or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place it under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white: and the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on top of the medicine, and press it a little bit.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because its biting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore this biting which he finds continues, then let go of the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider if you see the eyelid lifted, just as it is lifted with contraction by fire or incision, and that is good: and if not, then repeat over it with medicine on a different place where the medicine does not imprint and does not leave a mark, until your operation is equalized and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place over it a poultice with butter, until the burned skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with diaphanic ointment or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you to keep watch during the operation, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something from the hair enters the eye, then apply medicine to that area which becomes soft because of the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, your consideration should be according to this: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you cure the tear duct as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not bring relief: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to put their head in your shoulder, and have a servant hold their head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated with their head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the infused caustic in the white of the eye, or on the mucus of psillium above their eye: then apply fire to the cauterization, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's feather cane, from one end with which the cauterization is made: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other extremity, and if you wish it to go up in such a way, then try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the tear duct, if it is open, and drain the pus from it, and dry out the duct itself: and if it is not open, then open it, and drain its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place a cauterizer on top of it which becomes very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand near the cauterizer at the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the patient; and place the cauterizer on the fatty part of the eyelid, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you then reach to the beginning of your cauterizer all the way up to the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat your cauterizer once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a poultice with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if it has passed forty days and is not healed: then place a sharp corrosive medicine on top of it, until the mouth is uncovered; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Approach the place of the fistula and find it; then place in that opening a fine cannula, namely, a thin tube, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachma from molten lead; and hold your hand with good retention on the cannula, so that the patient is not moved at all, nor does he run or bring the molten lead to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place a poultice infused with egg white or water on top of the patient's eye.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the fistula and cures it with a wondrous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	And if the fistula is healed, as we said by cauterization and cure, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril and guide the fistula back into its natural course through the nose, according to what comes in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the manner of cauterizing lip fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter Twenty.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times, fissures occur on the lip which are called "Pili", and especially on the lips of boys.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you are treating these fissures as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not agree, then take a small cauterizing instrument, fashioned thus.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the burning instrument hastily into the very fissures until the cauter reaches to the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with cerate, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the manner of cauterizing mouth abscesses.
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an apostema occurs at the root of a tooth, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then pus forms and bursts forth: afterwards it becomes corrupted, and the pus runs and forms an abscess: then you should care for it, and the treatment does not agree in this case, then it is necessary that you take a cauterizing fire according to its size, which fits into the abscess.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the burning instrument into the orifice of the abscess, and hold your hand, until the hot iron reaches to its depth and end: do that once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it afterwards, as we said about the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the abscess is lanced and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the manner of cauterizing gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter Twenty-Two.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes softened due to humidity and the teeth are moved, and you care for it with medicines, but it does not agree: then place the head of the sick person on your shoulder.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the cauterizing tool, which will be shaped as follows, so that you place a cannula on top of the tooth: and insert into it the hot cauterized tool quickly: and hold your hand for a moment, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift up your hand: then repeat the cauterizing tool several times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then have the patient fill their mouth with saltwater and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth is strengthened by movement, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the manner of cauterizing teeth in pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is caused by coldness, either there is coldness itself or worms, and treatment does not help with medicines: then cauterization is done in that place according to two methods: either with butter or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, the cauterization of it with butter is, that you take goat's butter and boil it in an iron kettle or on a brazier.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth and wrap it around the end of the finger.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge the cloth in the boiled butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools down: then repeat it several times, until the heat of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you want, immerse a wool or cloth in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization with fire is, that you direct the hot cauterizing tool to a bronze or iron cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something thick in his body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take the cauterizer, which will have this form, and place it above that tooth; and hold your hand until the cauterizer becomes cool.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary when the cauterizer makes an impression on that tooth, for the sick person to fill their mouth with good betony and hold it there for one hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterizer.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extremity you have possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in strophules.
Caput XXIIII.	Book XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When the strophules are caused by phlegm and cold humidity, and they do not obey digestion through medicines, and you wish to hasten their digestion: then take a concave cauterizer with this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may come out at the cauterizer from the other extreme; and place it ignited once upon the swelling, and again if you need it, until it reaches to the depth of the swelling.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the swelling is small, then place the cauterizer according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place on top of it a poultice infused in butter until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Book 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moistures overcome the canal of the lungs, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the sick person be purged first with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize him at the back of the throat, near the root of the tongue, in a depressed place; and beware, lest with the cautery you reach the throat or skin, except for a little bit of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize him with another cautery at the junction of the neck, at the very end of his spine; and let the cautery be a nail, according to the manner that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what came before, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the manner of cauterizing in chest ailments and coughs.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and chest distress are from cold moistures, and the patient does not have fever or consumption, nor is it an old affliction; then cauterize him with two cauteries above the shoulder blade in depressed, soft, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And cauterize him with another one in the middle of the chest between two breasts; and let the cautery be a pipe-shaped one, according to the manner that came before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish, make your cautery by pricking with the instrument called Punctum, whose form preceded in piercing pain of ears; and let the pricks be from thirty to almost sixty.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what came before, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why should one be alleviated with him when you do with him a series of three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the manner of cauterizing in Titillicus, in dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is displaced due to moisture and does not return to its place within an hour from the start of displacement, until it becomes his habit of returning, then; afterwards it is displaced by a small motion which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation at first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should be placed supine on his back, or on a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the scalp, which is inside the tentorium, upwards with your left hand's fingers; and if the joint dislocation occurs towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cauterizing instrument with two handles.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the scalp until it penetrates to the other side and a figure of cauterization appears with four caustics.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cauterizing instrument having three handles, and so a figure of cauterization appears then with six caustics; and the handles are according to the subtlety of the net.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of the cauterizing instrument having three handles.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added to this method, and so there are eight caustics.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed thorns with salt on top of the cauterizer.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make sure the patient remains calm and quiet so that the limb does not move at any time until it is comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is above, and this rarely occurs, then cauterize it on top of the shoulder with a cauterizing instrument having a hinge, or with multiple small punctures.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Of the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When coldness and moisture occur in the Stomach, to such a degree that they extract it from its natural balance, and multiply catarrhs towards it, and constant methods of treatment do not benefit: then it is necessary for the patient to be placed supine on his back, and stretch out his legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three caustics, the first being under the ear of the breast as long as the first finger, and having a hinge; and two below, on both sides of one caustic, until a triangular figure of caustics appears.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch between both so that they may not join together when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of three thicknesses of skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish, apply a great cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery which makes this cautery be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by piercing it with one who is terrified by this cautery; and thus signs are made above the stomach at the point according to the quantity you wish with an encaustic: then cauterize it with a puncture cautery: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing the hypochondrium cold.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens that in the hypochondrium there is pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick cough, until the patient's natural excretion proceeds excessively and is cured with what we said, but does not benefit him: then it is necessary for the patient to be placed on his back, and three cauteries with an encaustic are marked according to this figure, and of the same quantity above the lower hypochondrium, where a man's elbow reaches: and let there be space between each cautery equal to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned be the thickness of skin, the middle part of it not added; and let the patient stand over his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already stretched out his legs and lifted up his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you, that you may cauterize these wounds with a cauterizing knife, when subtlety and prudence are with you in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not proceed too late in cauterizing, and that the thickness of the skin is thoroughly burnt, so that the body is thoroughly burnt and reaches to the intestines; for the skin there is thin, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the manner of cauterizing apostumes of the Apis.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that exitura occurs, and you wish to know if the aposteme is in the flesh of the Apis, or in its tunic; then if it is in the flesh of the Apis, it invades with a pitiful pain, and gravity without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the Apis, there is sharp pain with vehemence: and you see now that its cure has fatigued its physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore the patient must lean back over his own neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then place the figure of the aposteme with an encaustum; then apply fire to the cauter that is likened to a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that cauter one, until the skin is thoroughly burned and reaches to the siphac, until all pus has gone forth; then care for it with a cure of exiturata, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not right for this kind of cauterizing to be used, unless the study in the art of medicine is prolonged in him; and through whose hands these diseases concur with some experiment several times: then indeed he may dare to undertake this operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But rather to leave it, that is better with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the manner of cauterizing in Pleuresis.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients have said that a cauter with the roots of Aristolochia should be used for a cold Pleuresis in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the dried roots of Aristolochia long ones, one root longer than those which are found from it, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and burn it with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with a cautery one on the spot where the wing of the jawbone meets the neck, and two small cauteries slightly declined under the guilezzi slightly to the side towards the part that is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two small cauteries also on the spot where it is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly declined towards the back a little bit; and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the back: one on the spot where it is between two spoon-shaped bones; and two small cauteries from both sides of the chest, with the lower one being in the spot between two spoon-shaped bones.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not fitting for you to press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be in plain sight, smoldering on the surface of the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And now some ancient people have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a ray: and they heat it, and insert it into the spot between the ribs, until they reach with it to the abscess itself, and let the pus exit: just as we said in the case of apostema Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this operation with the cautery there is a risk, that either the sick person dies immediately, or an opening occurs in the place of a fistula, for which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Of the manner of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating the sickness of the spleen, as we said in the division of sicknesses, and your treatment does not take effect, then there is a cautery in it according to three modes, all of which are straight.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is, that you make three or four cauteries, lining them up according to the length of the spleen, following the figure of the cauteries of Epatis, whose preceding figure we have described.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be among all cauterization a quantity of thickness equal to that of a finger, or somewhat more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of cauterization be as we said it should be for cauterizing the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cauter, and let the patient lie weakly on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that the cauter having two prongs, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder, you raise the skin which is directly above the spleen, where the patient's left arm lies; and let your elevation be such as to elevate the skin according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two fiery prongs deeply into the skin, until they penetrate to the other side; then withdraw the cauter; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cauter having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauter after you have released it, allowing it to discharge pus over many days; for this is more beneficial than any preceding treatment in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Of the method of cauterizing in Hydrocephalus.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cauter does not fall into Hydrocephalus unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydrocephalus with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it four times around the navel, and one cauter above the stomach, and one cauter above the liver, and two cauteris after the spine between the vertebrae, and one on the direct of the breast, and another on the direct of the stomach; and let the quantity of depth of the cauter be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the cauter open, so that it may discharge pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after cauterization with him, because it is necessary that two intentions congregate to him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cauterizer with which the belly is cauterized should be a key; according to its shape: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-like, according to its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing Feet, and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they apostemate in hydropic and fill with citrine water: it is necessary that you cauterize above the dorsal part of the foot at night, which is between auricular and ankle; and raise your hand with the cauterizer, and do not twist him: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it entirely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the water citrine will drizzle, and let the cauterizer be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizers on both legs, one on each leg, and let the cauterizer be with the edge of a knife-shaped cauterizer; and let it be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and another above, about in the middle of the leg: and above all the hip, make two cauterizers: and leave the open cauterium without treatment for a long time, until some water drips from it: then cure it with the rest that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in resolving the Abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a resolution of the belly due to cold and humidity, until the retaining and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines, are weakened: and it is cured with methods of treatment, but does not heal; and you see the sick person tolerating the cauterizer with excessive vigor, then cauterize him with a great cauterizer above his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cauterizer, and four small cauterizers around the navel, with a small key-shaped cauterizer: and a large cauterizer or two over the alcatin above the hips.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures and the patient tolerates them, then cauterize him with a cauter on the breastbone and with another on all his hip; and perhaps add two small cauterizers near the great one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For indeed the cure is advancing, whose benefit does not stray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the manner of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are old and many hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, which are formed from thick, cold, or corrupted humors, and they are cured as we said in the division, and not by cure: then cauterize three cauterizers on the lower back of the loin a little triangularly under the armpit, and one cauterizer under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cooled and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in boils, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterizer, as before; and one on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a small cauterizer: and leave the cauter open for some time: thereafter cure him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the manner of cauterizing altitudes after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the altitude, then apply a cautery fire that is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning thing into the removed altitude: and your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many altitudes, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then cure them, with that which benefits them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a great cauter on alum, it is more beneficial for his sake.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When an invalid does not obey the section and operation that we have described in his place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be healed with a cauter.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore an abscess occurs to someone, and becomes old, pus flows out of it, and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore more noble that what is necessary is that you probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then bring forth the fire-catheter, which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself, ignited, into that abscess and note the quantity up to which you have entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And apply the cauter to it again and again, until all those corrupted bodies are burned away, once, twice, or thrice, according to your own necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And be careful not to burn the nerve if it is there, or a great vein; or if the abscess extends to the bladder or to the intestine, then be careful about all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that unless the abscess is in a fleshy place; and consider, because it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and remains thus for a long time: then you will know that it has already been healed entirely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not removed from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or that there is a corrupted opening deep within it, or almost one of those things, the remembrance of which will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the manner of cauterizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Here is the translation:
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens that there is pain in the kidneys from cold or from gross swelling, and it diminishes due to the weakness of the person, then it is necessary to cauterize the area above the membrane over the kidneys, cauterizing both kidneys with a caustic clavicle, the reminder of which precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it again on that very membrane.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why three lines?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more beneficial for healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the manner of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debility and softening occur in the Bladder, caused by cold and moisture, until the infirm person no longer retains urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the abdomen above the Bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and with a caustic from the right side of the abdomen, and another from the left side of that; and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of the thumb's knuckle: and cauterize it with an inferior back caustic, or two caustics if needed: and let it be done as the preceding clavicle caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the manner of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the Womb, and they prevent conception through that, and the menses of hers are corrupted, and their promotion is delayed, and pain comes to her at their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three caustics around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a caustic on the lower back, or two caustics: and let there be a clavicle caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the manner of cauterizing the Shoulder in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humidities flow to the socket of the Shoulder, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg extends over the other when they are brought together; and a vacant space is found at the site of dislocation.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient over the almond-shaped anchor of his own cauterio similar circle. After you have signed with encaustro around the circumference of the almond, as it revolutes; and so that the almond itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauter be one whose shape has preceded in cauterizing the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if this cauter is not present to you, then cauterize him with three cauterizations, using the olive-oil cauterio large; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin altogether.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the almond-shaped anchor and there are causes of cold and moisture, and the patient is treated as we said earlier, and the cure does not bring relief, and it becomes old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient from gross humors with foetid pills or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the manner of cauterization in that is according to two modes: either a cauterio with medicines that burn, or a cauterio with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cauterio with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the almond-shaped anchor of his own with three triangular cauterizations, in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between every cauterio be the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let the cauterio be olive-oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, it is necessary to make a cauterio in the middle over the head of his own anchor.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Wherefore there are four cauterias.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of an anchor's dislocation, one by one; so that the circle contains the entire anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method for cauterization in sciatica, when the pain clings to the sacrum itself and does not extend as far as the buttock and thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends as far as the buttock and thigh, then you should cauterize that place on the buttock with two cauteries, above where the patient complains of pain, and your own cautery on the hollow four fingers deep in the left side: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the patient complains that the pain extends as far as the toes of the foot, then you should cauterize him there where he complains with a punctiform cautery, three, four, or more, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the patient complains of pain being below the knee on the side towards the thigh, then you should cauterize him there with a single knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware of this in all your cauterizations, that you do not go so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery, and bring harm or constriction upon the patient through it.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one or two of those who had cauterized above the hollow and gone too far in their cauterization, and as a result, the leg has become swollen until it reached the foot, and the whole limb was perforated and corrupted: then there followed dissolution of the bowels and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is present on both sides simultaneously, cauterize both sides in this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said that in the cauterization of the sacrum, this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a like samai from iron, whose diameter is the middle of a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a finger's knuckle, or somewhat less: and within that samai, put another samai.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space that is between all the bones as much as the width of a thumb's knuckle: and let the bones be open on both sides: and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and make for them an armband from iron carefully fitted into the bones.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it should be ignited in the fire until it reddens and emits sparks: then it should be placed over a mortar anvil for an invalid or weak person to lean on, resting against a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, burn him with three round cauterizations on one side.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let it be released after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply ointments with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says: We have not used this type of cauterization much, because of the terror inspired by its appearance: and therefore, we have found few who dare to wait above it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Yet it is one of the good cauterizations for him who suffers, and finds a place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	However, this cauterization with burning medicines is such that you make two bones having a perforated armband, into which the hinge of its gate descends from air or iron, of equal length to the wall: whose height will be two knots, or almost as big as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space that is between each one as much as the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them be such that they contain themselves together, according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over a mortar anvil, for an invalid lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly onto the mortar anvil.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which has been heated with fire for a little while, and hold it for the duration of an hour: and let the invalid tolerate its biting and burning, for he will find the biting to be like fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wash away warm water from the beginning to the end along with sweet water: then let it be three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on top of it, until the blackening of burning is removed: and let it be for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the ultimate in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice for it in that which contains water, just as you did at the beginning evenly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and unextinguished calcis, one part of each: grind them both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into the radius; and put another glazed pot under the bottom of the first pot: and pour over the alkaline and calcis with sweet water, so that it submerges each by a finger's breadth: after which you compress them with your hand in good compression: and let the pot be, until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glazed pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather up all that water and pour it over the other calcis: and let it be, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterizing of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it brings about the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are made those with which the anus is cauterized, and also like thermises, and honey of anacardium, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported, telling the cure of some ancient man, by which he was cured of the pain in the anus and sciatic vein: and magnified it to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that the patient does not need another treatment and that he was cured from just one remedy, until he brought it back, because perhaps himself had gone into the bath carried and had come out already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from a green saffron: and if the green one is not found, let a dry one be taken, fresh: and let it be ground much with a little fat, and put it on the spot where there is pain, or knee, or in the hip: and bind it up, and leave it for a period of three hours, or for as long as the sick person feels relief from burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes humid, put him on a seat.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not fitting for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that goat dung, when applied to a person being cauterized with it for the sciatic vein, helps him: and makes a cauterization in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and let it be put on the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and burn it over the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it on top of the wool and let it go until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	And do not stop doing that until the sense reaches through the application all the way to the knee, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinium.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes it happens that pain occurs in the back due to many causes, or by chance, or by a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, through the infusion of cold and wet matter: and cauterization indeed does not fall, unless in this single species which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary after the evacuation of the patient with pills that are fetid and similar to them, so that they be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the breadth of the patient's body, after which signs are marked with encaustic in each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the patient by his virtue: and let the cauterization be done with a cauterizing point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three times or four with a cauterizing point of the middle claw, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in cases of Gibbous Inflammation.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its inception is that it happens to boys as a constriction in breathing at elevation and motion; and you will find it in the last vertebrae of the back and knots of theirs, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see this and wish to do it, then cauterize him with a cauterizing point that is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And take the cauterizing point over all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a puncturing point two or three lines: and let them be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply a cauterizing point to the gibbosity which occurs in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in Gout and pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are from cold humidities that flow to any part of the body, and when they occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians it is proper to call that Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore podagra is cured due to cold causes with modes of cure, and pains are not removed, then a cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that he cauterizes him after purging around the joint of the feet with many cauteries; and let the cauter be Olive.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this is the form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you wish to prick on the surface of the foot, then do so with a cauter.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and often that happens, then cauterize him over all the knee with three cauteries, or four from every part, with the same cauter of Clavus.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cauter, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cauter, rather it should be about as thick as the thickness of skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then apply what we said earlier from the cauter, in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if the pains are only in the hands: then prick around the wrists, as two lines turn back.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains from the pains in the fingers: then prick them, over every joint pricking and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after days to the hips or shoulders: then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not purge the patient with a good regimen, nor by taking medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is done, and phlegm is purged, he will be healed with the help of God with this cauter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ Of the manner of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is that which begins to be near: then it is necessary for you to advise the patient to stop eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And it uses something gentle, whereby dung will descend from its stomach.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit him between your hands on his back: and bid him to hold his breath until he goes out, or appears to be passing stool, or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then lead him with your fingers, and mark with an encaustum beneath the rupture above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then use an iron cautery, which has this shape, until it comes white and sheds sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then lead the intestine or intestine back to its natural curve.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand on the spot to prevent the intestine from coming out: and you have already opened up between the patient's legs, and placed a poultice underneath him, and another servant above his legs, and another above his chest who is holding hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on top of it with your hand steady upright alongside.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach the mouth with him: or go around him again in a different way if you are not able to reach the mouth with him at first.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cautery hour, lest you burn him and cause harm to come upon the patient or even death.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation does not matter.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary for the cautery of infants to be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining ointments until he heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you place his food in proportion to the length of time required for his cure, so that it soothes his stomach: lest he excrete intestine during eating and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to operate after forty days, then administer a well-made ligament and hold it for forty other days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be freed from labor, and from taking food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed by a complete cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say the treatment of ruptures with an incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the remaining part of the belly, and are just beginning, and it is desired that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a rounded caustic according to its size: and let what is burned be as its third from that time.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it according to what we have said, and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with encaustum, and a line is placed that is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a caustic awl.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But first, the caustic is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of pain due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some members due to a fall or blow, and pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not bring relief: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the point caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the caustic be for every part according to its size, and its softness, and weakness, and strength, and the location of the torsion, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then he is healed by the first caustic, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then iterate over this cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary for these pains to shift from one member to another that approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore you should follow them with the cautery until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	About the manner of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers are sometimes relieved by cauterization to the greatest extent.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegmatic and melancholic humors: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	So if the leprosy is not responding and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not subside or stand still: and you fear for the patient, because corruption may spread to his entire complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head, marked; and a second one lower down towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on both horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And with the last of your fingers and the cautery, press slightly until it makes a small impression on his mouth, and the bark breaks out: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from him may be alleviated, and cauterize also over his spleen, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauterizations which we said in the chapter, and also cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheekbone, and two on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large on the hips at the end of the spine and one above it, in the middle of the nape: and two on the armpits: that is to say, one on each armpit, and two on each knee, and two on each shoulder, and two on each elbow, and two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him over every joint, from the joints of his fingers, hands, and feet: and cauterize also over every heel of his feet, and toe of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the heel bone, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery over the hipbone, and another time over the ribcage, and again over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add to the cautery, the greater is its benefit and effectiveness.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak one does not find pain in a cautery, as the healthy ones do; therefore, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it should be that the cauteries are of great size and smallness according to members and joints: according to what preceded from the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cautery with flour from a plant mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter 1.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When some member is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and poultices, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb member with cauteries, according to the magnitude of the member or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And make your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin a little bit.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment, until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot at the spine of the back where the nerves that move that member are located; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not presume over this unless one is wise in the anatomy of members and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in blisters.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When a blister becomes old and does not yield to anything from the arts of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a little bit, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whitishness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the flour of a herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and heron's blood: each one be part of one: let these all be mixed together, and be spread over a cloth, and stick to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning to form and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circle, as if it were revolving.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But wise men have said that the cancer should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it doesn't seem right to me, because I fear that it will ulcers; and I have already seen this happen on a few occasions.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adubenatae.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an Adubenata and it is delayed in maturing, either because of superfluity causing it or because of the weakness of age, when there is a deficiency of blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten its maturation; then cauterize around its circumference with small cauteries, making many punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubenata, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows, so that the flow of pus may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the manner of cauterizing in a corrupting evil.
Caput LIIII.	Here is the translation:
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not anything other than corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	So if you see a corroding wound in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then many small and great cauteries will be applied to it, according to the nature of the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all parts until you eradicate the entire corruption, and not a single thing remains of it completely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it be for three days, and place over the cauterized areas sulfur that has been ground with oil, until all scabs are eradicated and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with ointments producing flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	So if you see that after three days, healthy flesh is born, without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then reapply the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corrosion is healed sometimes with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Itself rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cautery with fire is more expeditious for relief; and I have already said its division with acute medicine: therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Claws and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered substance that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there is indeed a cautery for them in two ways: one with fire and the other with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But when it is done with fire, make the cautery cone-shaped like a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron, according to the size that contains a claw from all sides; and let it have a thin edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated instrument over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and let it be for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply ointment to it with the juices of wild rue, crushed with salt: and let the dressing be on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be rooted out from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a unguent of generated flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then administer to them a cautery with hot water: and it is, as you take a tube made of air, or iron, or from a bird's feather: and place it over the nail, or the ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand firm and turn it with compressive pressure from your own hand for a little while, so that the margin of the tube imprints itself on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a moment after the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it be, for the nail is rooted out with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do this one after another, until you come to all those that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they have been rooted out, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that they tremble from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another such cause: then it is necessary for you to cauterize it four times, or five times, over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra, and on his chest, and above his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Shaking (tremor) ceases with olive oil cautery, and hastens recovery from cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterizing: Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes the foul things, that is, pimples, which are produced from corrupted thick substances, are purged out of the body by Albathir.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is therefore necessary at first to cauterize all pimples with a subtle cautery and the wood of myrtle, whose extremity has been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of Aristolochia longa.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized to dry up at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase; and the excess is broken forth, making them whole again.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary for that to be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterizing in bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times it happens that bleeding occurs from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or from a cautery on a member, and similar cases: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on top of it: and press it down much, until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing else comes out.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small and large olive oil cauterias in the fire, and blow on them until they become very well lit.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is disrupted, and put the cauteria on top of the vein, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cauteria until the bleeding stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the blood is expelled when you lift your finger from the artery opening and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, prepared beforehand among those that are in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing that one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another misfortune occur above the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially if the artery is great, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, its ends contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or be tied with a strong tying thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or put on top of it medicines with the property to stop bleeding, and bind with a decent constriction using poultices.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who administers its cutting off with a bandage and binding with cloth, or by placing the things that are burning in similar ways, does not at all benefit it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however it happens to someone and there is no doctor present nor medicine: then he will start by placing the index finger on top of the opening of the vein itself, just as we narrated, and constricting it very much, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed from above it with cold water of very intense coldness always, until the blood freezes and thickens and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what is needed for the cautery or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	Paragraph 1: End.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Al-Bubus (Albucasis) Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	About incision, perforation, and bloodletting in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every affliction which is suitable for a caustic cautery and burning medicine, and its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed the chapters there from top to bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same route, so that what is sought may be found for those seeking relief.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my sons, to learn what is in this chapter, which is frightening, just like the one in the First Chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, it is necessary to be even more cautious, since in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or curing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of these fear, trembling, and death occur in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, let not that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes such things happen to you in this art, with regard to men and their various infirmities.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For one of them is angry with his own affliction, and death is light to him: because of the intensity of his anger which he finds from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when afflicted, it is due to fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And one of them gives himself over to his own medicine, and enriches you with it, hoping for recovery, and his affliction is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, do not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your desire and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from that, unless after certain knowledge has verified it with you, which confirms the successful succession to what has been reached.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use prognosis and indication for the cure of all your patients, so that salvation may be fittingly achieved.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is assistance to you for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God guide you, sons, with his understanding, and not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed arranged this Chapter by dividing it into chapters, just as preceded in the chapter on Cauterization, from head to feet; so that what you seek may be alleviated for you, and where you are lacking.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	About the treatment of water that gathers in children's heads.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often befalls children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also because of a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed did not see this sickness in anyone other than children: and to all of them from whom I saw it, death has hastened forth: therefore it seemed to me that I should abandon the treatment for it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I indeed saw a child from whom, whose head was filled with water, and his head grew in all day, until he could no longer sit upright because of the greatness of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either accumulates between the skin and mouth: or it accumulates under the bone above the sinuses.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if there is moisture between the skin and mouth, and a small apostema is present, then you must make an incision in the middle of the head, making one gap about two nodes wide, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	So if moisture has been increased and the abscess is larger, then place these two incisions according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and you see a sign of it, namely that you see the edges of the head open from every side; and when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to cut in the middle of the head three incisions, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove the moisture entirely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tie the incisions with cloths and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then pack that on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage and care for the wound with threads and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head with equal tightness.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person all dry food with a little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is, that you should observe where the magnitude of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more prominent on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascend with an incision where you see the abscess and filling of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware that you do not cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	§ On the cutting of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone experiences a discharge from their eyes or chest and it becomes old and does not respond to medical treatment: then the ultimate cure for that is by cutting these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to cut them that the patient weakly bends his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should tighten his neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then examine where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And both locations are places that are behind ears depressed: and it is rarely hidden except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with encaustum over each one: and cut both with a scalp-lifter on either side accurately, the incision reaching to the mouth: and make it along the breadth of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalp-lifter under the artery, and cut it to the upper parts with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be nearly as long as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood issues forth in pulsatile emission, which flows inward with frequent leaping.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with encaustum, and find down to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which is necessary to be emitted from blood is 6 ounces, and perhaps you may emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole thing according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then examine the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains at the mouth from the stitch, then cut it so that a warm abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with linen strips from a cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Of the extraction of arteries which are in temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania or acute catarrah occurs in someone due to acidic moistures and heat in the temples of the hands or feet, or old soda, which is pungent and similar to those: and it is treated with modes of medical cure, and not brought to a conclusion: then we are experienced in these afflictions by extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of performing the operation for extracting ears is, that the surgeon should shave off the hairs which are on the temples, and direct himself towards the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is itself shown to you by its pulse, and rarely hidden except in a few men or in extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then the surgeon should bind his patient's head with any cloth of his own; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or moisten the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula that I shaped a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then place a hook in it and pull it out upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and make it slip out from the tunics that are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is slender: then wrap it around with the extremity of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off from it that part according to the length of its extensions and contractions, and that no flow of blood may occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut off, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend thoroughly.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	For if the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a doubled thread of strong silk or from the sinew of an antelope, so that it may not hasten to putrefaction before the wound is consolidated and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess that is between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizing tool up to the mouth, with a culinary knife, until its ends are cut and it remains in the same place of the work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better, unless the patient has a fever, or a warm complexional constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cautery is one of those things that are useful for drying out humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to be beneficial.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the removal of arteries, the place should be filled with old ashes; and fine lint should be placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound is cleansed, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to form, and with egg whites, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if while you are operating a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with zinc oxide: and bind your hand tight until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of those things is present to you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dress the wound with water of very cold temperature, until the sharpness subsides and is tied as it should be.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And since it is easier and less painful to extract an artery, it is that you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to a thin thread.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, the cold hastens to both, and do not cut through flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is a little thickness in them, the heat of fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut through quickly; with this, then, it is better than all work, and easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark out two places with encaustic; and take both hot ones away from each other, until they reach the mouth, and cut through the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities may be separated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not consolidated with this cautery thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of habitual and stubborn acute eye discharges.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are habitual discharges and their course is from the veins above the outer part of the head, and nothing seems to be done for them by medicine with medicines, and you see the patient's face already red, and they feel a sensation in their forehead as if it were the walking of ants: and their eyes are shriveled, moist, so that their eyelashes have already been consumed along with consumption; and their eyelids have become inflamed from the sharpness of the discharges. Then the ancients resorted to this treatment, and called it a cure with a knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And one is that you should command the patient to shave off the hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three incisions on the forehead, equally spaced along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be almost two fingers, and one incision should be equally distant from the middle of the nose on the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little more than the distance between the arms, and the third at the other side; and beware of cutting into the arteries which are on both sides: and stretch out your hand away from the connection of the two jawbones, and let the space of all incision be the length of three connected fingers: and prepare for yourself a piece of sponge or many dry cloths with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula into the two sharp edges at the ends, whose form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is at the side of the temple to the second incision: and scrape away with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the scab that is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then make that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then take out this spatula-like thing, and insert another instrument into the first incision again, which is called a sharp knife, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it towards the attached skin with the flesh, and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut off with it all the fatty tissues that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what remains in the incision up to where it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make that also in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal amount of blood has flowed out, express the areas from the congealed blood clots.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place a linen cloth from old cotton into every fissure, and put over them poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that no warm abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer a great many infusions with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with balsam ointment and the other things by which wounds are healed, until it is cured.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Of the cure for sharp tears and catarrhs to the eyes from internal head afflictions.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone is afflicted with sharp, severe, and constant catarrhs, and you see their eyes are sunken, small, and already weakened in appearance; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain deep within the head, causing suffering and subsequent sneezing: then take action against these afflictions, those materials which do not come forth except through many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you should order the ailing person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut into one groove in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly narrower on either side, and start with the incision from the left temporal to the right temporal area: and make the incision up to the bone. And stretch out your hand away from the temporal bones which move during mastication, until when the bone is exposed, and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with a hot cautery, or with linen strips soaked in lard.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie it on top with wool threads; and soak the wool threads with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it and see that the hot abscess is already subsiding: then it is necessary to burn the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a regimen of cauterization that causes flesh to grow: just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Of the treatment for that which falls on the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into the Ear is of one or four kinds: either a mineral stone, or like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as beans and peas; or it is a flowing substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When then something falls into the ear that is a stone or a type of stone which does not accumulate or grow inside the ear, simply expose the ear to air. But if you see a stone, then distill something from violet oil or sassafras into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and cause to sneeze with condiment, and plug the nostrils at the advent of sneezing, after you put a wad of cloth or wool in the ear canal and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment often issues forth.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not issue forth, then administer the extraction of it with gestures, that is, with small pizzicaroli; whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	So if it issues forth with gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a small blind hook of slight duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	So if it does not issue forth through that, then make a catheter from air, and insert the end of the catheter into the ear canal far in, and plug what is inside the catheter's circumference with a soft wax candle mixed with oil, so that there is no passage except for the catheter: then draw out with your strong wind attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For this often issues forth as we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not issue forth in this way: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the veso, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a moderate amount; and place it at the end of the ear canal after you have wrapped a decent-sized cloth around it; then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have dried the ear of moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if it does not issue forth with all that we have narrated, then hasten to divide it, before a hot abscess or spasms occur.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that you should make a small wound first in the cephalic part, and then draw out from it according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn their ear upwards, and find a small wound in the root of the ear at the fatty part of it in the depressed place itself: and let the wound be of a lunar shape until you reach the stone; then take out the stone along with what is possible to you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then close up the wound with speed from your own hour and cure it, until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falls into the ear that grows and swells from one grain of wheat: then perform an extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to you at the exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the removal of that type of grain from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do it when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place many poultices: then remove them with a hook or with a thin probe or by suction, as we said, for the removal of it will be facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, when the water enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use gentle blowing with condiments first; and now he has filled his ear with a little cooked old fat; and he lies on top of that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it then comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, and warm them with fire for a little while, and the patient should insert one of them into the ear canal of his own ear; and let him sit on one foot from that side, and strike another stone against the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	And therefore do not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now that the water comes out so, you take a papyrus or a reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed and do that many times, until all the water comes out; and remove it with a cannula, as was previously mentioned in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an animal that has entered the body, if it is a small creature like a flea and similar to one, treat it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large creature of the body that appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with a gesture and a hook; and its outcome is easier for all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In extracting a worm that has been generated in the ear, when you treat it as we said in division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear to the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from worms, then extract it with a gesture or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of this shape, constricted below, broad above; and insert the thin end into the ear according to the quantity that an invalid can tolerate it: then suck with it using strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the worms go out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to come out, then smear the rim of the cannula with wax, as I said in stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations which ancient ones have experienced in the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flow be as when you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver or bronze, constricted below, with a small hole, broad above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So let the pushing thing that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze well done.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a thread and wrap it around the end of it with a decent wrapping: then pour oil, or sap, or what you like from those medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the thread with the wrapped part above, and express it with your hand compression moderated, until the oil is pushed into the concavity of hearing, and the invalid feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should now be warmed with fire for a little while: and beware lest what is distilled in it be very cold: medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	About the care for accidental injury of gold.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes, certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs not perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that a piece of flesh is torn out from the ear due to a wound or born with it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this piece of flesh sometimes forms in the deep hole of the ear which is not visible; and sometimes it occurs near the outside of the hole and is visible.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs in the deep ear and is not comprehended by sight is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for that which is visible, it is necessary to place the ear of the injured person in the sun and look at it. Then, if you see the piece of flesh appearing, open it with a small, thin spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should be slightly indented, with some part being sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be smooth on both sides, so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the piece of flesh is born with the ear, then take it with a small hook and cut it off with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	What if the piece of flesh is in the deep ear? Then take a thin, smooth reed and warm it with fire for a little while. Then put it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel the piece of flesh with that which the patient finds with heaviness of hearing, try to open it gently and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place a lint dressing in the ear according to the size of the hole that you wrapped with Egyptian ointment. Make it last for several days until you are certain of the wound's consolidation.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take lint and soak it in rose water, then powder zege over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already suppurating: then it is necessary to remove the linen, and let it be wrapped with another linen that has been dipped in a mixture made with cerate mixed with rose oil, until the supuration cools down: then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if a flow of blood occurs: then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear: and apply the remaining treatment which stops the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	The cure for Althel's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli which occur on the eyelids of the eyes, are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should remove them with tweezers or a forceps, and cut them off at the roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zinc on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, the roots are burned away and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	The cure for eyelid granulations of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something occurs on the eyelids which is similar to a granulation in its strength and toughness, and because of this it is named Granum: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation is to examine whether it is a Granum that proceeds from it, which appears on the eyelid and moves in all directions, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore a split or incision over it along its length.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then strip it from every part with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cutting of it is not prepared for you, except after you have pierced the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may cause harm to the invalid.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the wound is great: then gather it together with a suture and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it's small, no evil will befall you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the stone is inclined towards the inner part of the ear, towards the internal surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the stone with a hook; besides which you will need an incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	For if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, it does not cause harm to anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the stone's incision, with salted water; and take care of the place with what fleshes it out, until the invalid is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	About the cure of Axirnath eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fatness that is generated in the eyelids of the upper eye lid; and it happens to children most of all: and it weighs down their eyes, and occasions them to have cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot gaze at the light of the sun, therefore, because tears press towards them, and for this reason you see them lying down on their faces always, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are under their eyebrows damp, which has already been covered by swelling: and the Axirnath itself is indeed visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is, that the invalid puts his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with oil of linden, and make from it an ointment circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it and press with your fingers all around, so that the Axirnath may gather in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula incidentally splitting fissures by width, and let not that fissure be greater which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary for you to split the skin entirely, until you reach the Axirnath, for indeed Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the shape of white fatty excrescence.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth which you had inserted between your fingers at the exterior: and turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses: and beware, lest you add to the fissure, so that you do not come with the spatula to the eye and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, then add a little to the fissure with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the spot, and bind it with wool.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who rub salt, and place it in the concavity of the fissure, so that what remains of that moisture may dissolve.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an ulcerated sore occurs on the spot, then care for it with soothing poultices, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Of the methods of Ataxmir for the eyes, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and the eye is inflamed, so that it is red as if it should not be.
Caput XI.	Here is the translation:
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When eyebrows grow excess hairs that are added besides the natural course under natural hairs, and they age: then they harm the eye, and cause various kinds of afflictions to occur, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and a white haze, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed the eyesight is cured according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to what has been set forth in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannulas, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the patient on your shoulder.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle pierce through with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where hairs grow: and pull the thread up to the upper part with the eyelid, and turn it with the finger.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, under the added hairs, with a spatula coming from the larger tear duct down to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread and place a small poultice made of cloth or linen under the eyelid; then mark on top of the eyelid with an encaustum, so that it is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; for that already differs among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some of these people are those who need the quantity to be cut from the eyelid which is excessive and softens the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you find the spot on the skin above two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a split one near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather the edges with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make what remains from the threads stick to the two eyebrows, with certain substances applied, if you wish to do so; and if not, don't bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and thread for three days or four: afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let the wound heal without a suture, and care for it with something that dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised in cases of cicatrization and its gathering; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancient people taught this method of treating wounds.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the patient who is weak, and it comes from good workmanship, and there is no fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, to mark signs on the eyelid in the shape of a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this shape which follows; then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not match that; then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert the thread one near the larger tear duct, and the second near the smaller tear duct: and gather between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift up your hand with an equal elevation; and lift up the skin over that which is marked out, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two edges of the wound with a suture; and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, an abscess should occur at your incision or your cut, cover that abscess with cerate and similar substances, such as ointments soothing to the skin.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelids also turn outward, so that its hairs are turned in the opposite direction.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use what we said about incision on it, but with sutures it is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And so, you will turn back the eyelid and cut through the cleft that is inside, as I narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two reeds or two thin sticks by art, whose length will be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width will be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already cut at the extremities on both sides from both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both of them with subtlety above what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two reeds tightly on both sides with a strong tightening, and let it be for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For a tight skin will die, and become blackened, and rotten, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, the eyelid will be lifted up: and the hairs do not sting.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two reeds which you will make according to this shape and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Of the elevation of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Here is the translation:
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	Operation is this: you take a fine needle and insert into it a thin silk thread, smooth.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather up its ends and tie both with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose another fine thread under it in a short space, and tie up its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient should place his head on your lap, and let it be near the sun, that the operation may be revealed: for this is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull it out above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to the thread: and insert into the thread that hair, if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread into the eyelid along with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the thread is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the thread downwards with the thread that you composed in it, until the thread comes out from the upper opening, and you will see it with your own eyes: then indeed pull the thread and the filament; and extract both, and shut the eye; and let it be closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	And if the hair is short, then either join a long hair from natural hairs to it, and lift it up with it; or leave it alone until it lengthens after some time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ Concerning the care of a condition that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to an eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this is Al-Khatarat, either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore it is accidental, arising from the closure of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar things to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is that you find this closure, and separate its lips, and place a linen cloth between them, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use things that dry and constrict for its treatment, for if you do that, Al-Khatarat will worsen than it was. Instead, use things that soften, such as linseed: and mix it with water in which althea seeds have been cooked; and apply a balm of dyaquilon, which has been mixed with some oil; and wrap it with a linen cloth, and care for it with this.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of treatment is to strive with all one's ingenuity so that it may not be consolidated, according to its original shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is nothing but a correction of Al-Khatarat so that it does not return to its original shape entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	About the treatment of Al-Khatarat which occurs in the lower eyelid and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Al-Khatarat which occurs below is what is truly called Al-Khatarat.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is both natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it is accidental, arising from a wound, or a fissure, or a cauterization, and similar things to those.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of treatment for it is that you take a needle with a thread double, and wet it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the figure of the eyebrow is restored as it should be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a reed, and place it in the cleft, and turn with it the eyebrow; and make two clefts on the inner side of the eyebrow, and let the ends of the two clefts be at the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they are gathered together, this figure will result, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by as much as its lower acute side is below the eyebrow.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: or sew it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said about softening medicines and liquid ones, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the flesh becomes inflamed from the cleft or suture or cautery: then it is necessary to make a flat incision beneath the hairs of the eyelids, even as before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the space between two lips with a liquid substance, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech about treating Alxatrati is this: when it occurs above or below, is that the operation should run in it according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is a many-colored thing in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his skill by whatever means are possible to him, until he makes the figure return to its natural shape or nearly so, and even himself weakens according to how it suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	At times this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the tip of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a hook: then cut away the adhesion with a thin spatula, but not so sharp as to cause harm to the sick person during the operation. Rather, let the spatula be slightly dull for a little while, so that the patient is not disturbed by the procedure, and you remove the spatula, and do not injure the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be like excising that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it clean with water: or let it drip onto it from a piece of sief-made, dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth: and place over the eye a woolen cloth infused with lamb's white: and after three days, use sief, and with solidified substances, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	About the cutting of the nail and the excrescence of flesh tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerve-like: and is similar to a piece of sief, hard and subtle.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched by iron, or is grasped with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, unless from the larger tear, until it gradually goes away, until it covers the sight, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method for cutting it is: that the patient places his head on your shoulder.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift up his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then grasp the nail with a hook of moderate thickness, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take an awl and insert a bristle from the mane of a horse, or ox, or goat: and let the thread be strong, and double the extremity of the awl for a little while, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the awl, and tie it with the thread the nail, and stretch it upwards: and scrape off with a bristle the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sewing it with a bristle up to its posterior.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut away the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a fine forceps or small scissors: and let the natural flesh of the tear duct be left, so that no continuous flow of tears may occur as a result of the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape off with a gentle forceps whose shape this is.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware that the forceps does not touch the horned tunica, lest there be a tear and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt into the eye, or made from juniper, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is needed until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert an awl into it, nor does a hook fit into it, then this kind of nail is often cured with medicines, and heals as I narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a fine, gentle, blunt forceps, with this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail above with smoothness and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	And if you see that it is rarefied and broken off, and leaves an impression on it, then drip from your hour onto the eye made with juniper or red powder, or crushed salt: and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then proceed over that same operation until everything is removed from it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the opposite eye has a hot abscess: then indeed leave that one alone and cure the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then proceed with the operation on that one with caution, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the eyelid flesh causes great harm to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook and cut off from that part; and do not make the incision too long so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then treat the tear duct whether it is red or made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It sometimes happens in certain people's eyes that red flesh is formed, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, approaches, or stretches over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose bush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in that case is also to have the weak person place their head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and gather up that whole flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or instrument.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until the entire thing is finished with a cutting tool.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye so that you do not harm it during the operation; and let your cut be such as you make it, or with a spatula, as we narrated in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the abscess is gathered, according to how its shape will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your cutting is complete and the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines; and place a covering of wool with egg white on top of the eye to secure it from hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains from the almond gall and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess; then let go of the eye and care for it with that which soothes the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then proceed over it with an operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same with added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you let others treat a weak eye from a natural or accidental cause by means of iron, and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that treatment.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Of the Collection of Pus from the Eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus are red veins that form over the eye and prevent their own operation; and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye that has pus is strong and not troubled by any illness other than the pus; then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary for you to instruct the weak one to place their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks, according to your discretion; and the hook should be thin and of double plaiting, in this shape, or there should be two hooks gradually arranged in one body, in this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wash away the blood an hour after the hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware not to injure the eye with the sharp edges.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at noon before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then pour into the eye whether green or red, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to gather all of that in one hour, then bind the eye with a poultice that soothes the pain of the eye: and let him be for some days until the pain subsides: and keep it safe from warm apostema. Then go back over it in the same way until he is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of a forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	About reducing an arrow to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctor of the arrow wound, which is treated with a cauter or a burning medicine that cuts sharply, according to what has been told beforehand.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no talent in it: unless you lay something over the suppurating abscess at its birth and remove all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the mouth is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the mouth is uncovered, and you see in it a corruption or blackness, then scrape it away with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Scapocephalus.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from iron hardened in the fire, and let its head be rounded like an asher, which is pierced with a fine file point or a delicate file point: and place it over the corrupted bone site.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it back between your fingers and press your hand on it for a moment, until you know that the corruption has already been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal astringents and styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated and flesh grows in it, and the course of healing runs its natural course: and remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, nor suppurate, nor any accident befall it: then you will know that it has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent in it, unless you reduce the abscess to the nasal opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you remove from bone second with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a chisel second in this form, having an iron extremity, triangular; and the wood of it be a narrowed pyramid down to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct; and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the chisel, until it penetrates the bone, and feels weak by it; because it finds air to come out of it, when he holds his hand above his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows and the place hardens: then the matter that was flowing outward returns to the nose: so it is lighter on the sufferer.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Paragraph on the Reduction of an Elevation of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the Eye protrudes with its entirety and does not cause harm or diminution to vision: then it is necessary to release the sufferer: afterwards bleed him: afterward place poultices on his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment above the Eye that is made from acacia, and aloe, and galbanum, and sarcocola.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the Eye on top with a plaster having many wool fibers.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of wool fibers is: take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth with four of them; make many from them; then place one on top of another, according to the size needed by the Eye; then bind above them with a strong strap.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat poultices with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the poultices and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligament becomes soft again, then it is necessary to tighten it much. Then remove the ligament after day and night, just as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then you see the eye has returned to its skin layer, that is good. And if not, then apply another poultice, and swellings, and tightening, and windings, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Chapter on Cutting the Skin Layer of the Eye.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the skin layer of the eye, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like an eye granule, and disfigures the human form because of it, and one wants to cut it out: then the operation is in that, according to what I will say: and it is, to insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which there is a double thread from the tear-duct side, and make it penetrate; and let the first needle follow its own course.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the eye around the needle; and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then pull out the needle, and place a thread soaked in the whites of an egg over the eye; and leave it until the thread falls off with the skin.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes tighten the skin of the eye all around with a bandage of cloth, until the eye becomes greatly prominent.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then perforate it with a thin spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and let the whitish humor flow, and let the eye go down, and enter immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Chapter on Curing an Alconmat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This affliction which is called an Alconmat is not anything except a discharge that gathers in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation in that case is, that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat or a direct one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see blood reaching the lower eyelids with your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed and does not descend, and the light is blocked: and let the patient see things as he used to see them; and if it does not go down below, you will know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if it is not prepared to descend with the bleeding as we said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin splinter and insert it with him above the fatty fold for a short time at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic on the crown, until the bleeding goes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has gone out, then pour warm water into the eye that you mixed with honey: or water in which you have boiled Greek hay and honey: then take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	About the cure for water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have spoken of the kind of water for dividing and what is suitable for piercing, as explained and demonstrated by speech; then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands square, opposite to the light, near the sun; and bind his eye with a bandage, and pull him tightly; then cover the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the water-filled eye is on the left: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand as a bandage if the eye is left: or your left hand as a bandage if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the bandage near the crown at the thickness of the radius on the apparent whiteness of the small tear gland of the eye; then push the bandage with force: and you revolve with him your hand, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and feel that the bandage has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that there be a measure of the path to the depth, a measure of space from the pupil to the end of blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see these things in the very vision of the eye itself, on account of the brightness of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagda up to the point where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards with one stroke after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water flows down immediately, then the invalid will see that thing which opens his vision immediately, and the almagda is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water flows down, then remove it secondly, except that the almagda goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed and does not rise: then extract the almagda with ease: and you revolve your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt of a gem in water: and wash the eye inwardly with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place all of this stuff outside the eye, or wool infused with rose oil and egg whites: and bind it to a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place upon it pounded cinnamon with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	And if the almagda does not obey you at all in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is made by men whose eyes are very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula-like thing which is called Alberid, and this is its shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore join it to him with a connecting piece just so much, and do not put your hand too far into the opening: and it is only necessary that you make a way for the almagda to its subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, as we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the invalid a well-made bedchamber, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark room; and let him be prevented from all movements, and from coughing: and give him that food which soothes his nature: and do not allow him to move his head at all to the right or left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let it be a ligament according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen that in that dark house and test the appearance of it: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament to its original state until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting for him to do that at the hour of healing or immediately after the incision: rather, let someone else do it: because water rises quickly through a violent appearance.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a warm abscess occurs: then it is fitting that you loosen the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it with what calms the abscess, until it is calmed: then release his sight, and place over his face an oral device by which his vision may be regulated for several days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out from the house gradually and turn back to his own tents.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in greenery a student is not excused from sight several times: then indeed he may venture upon the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed one has come to us from those who are of Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated Magdan was made, through which water is sipped.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But I did not see anyone on your land who did that: nor do I read it in any of the old books: and it is possible that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of species from Magdan, so that they stand over those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from bronze properly: and let their extremities be with this same subtlety triangular, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	Magdan forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	¶ About the care of a nasal polyp.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there arise in the nose diverse added flesh, from which is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from it is the cancerous, stony, reddish flesh; and from it is what is soft, not reddish.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	So then, on the person who has a wound from these meats that is gentle, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open their nostrils, and put a hook in those fleshy parts: then draw them outwards, and cut off what you have taken with a thin, sharp scalpel from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if something remains of which removal is not possible: then scrape that off with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood rules over you, or a warm abscess occurs: then place what is needed opposite it; or if it is from malicious abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood ceases and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then a mixture of vinegar, water, or wine should be poured into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it all the way to the palate, then you will know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that within him is flesh that has grown in the upper bones of the nose, to which the cutting instrument did not reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread with some thickness and tie many knots in it: and place between every knot the length of a finger or less: and let the patient, as he will, put one end of the thread into his nose with a reed or whatever means possible for him after he has done so similarly to ease: and draw out his mucus, until it reaches the throat and comes out over his tongue.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many people indeed do this similar to that young boy Attomus in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wants.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two ends of the thread, one that goes out above the nose and the other that remains on the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then tie the thread around the flesh with knots which are found in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now tied with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread and put it in the nose after bleeding has stopped, with the licorice that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more, until the ointment has seeped into all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put a lead tube at the end of it in the nose, for several days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs drying treatment, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a cupping instrument for the head, by which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make one from silver or bronze, which is similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its channel similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the bowl of the instrument for cupping should be full and open, with a handle at its end, by which you will hold it when you heat oil or what you want from resin and flowing substances in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Paragraph on the cure for a nose boil.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A boil often arises at the end of the nose and grows, increasing with days, until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to cut off that boil at the beginning of its appearance and root out all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place something over the spot, or a cautery, or a medicine that burns where it is.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If then the cutting off of it is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is hard, rough, and has a dull color, with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	I have often seen someone who had cut open an abscess on himself and as a result suffered great harm to himself.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is a gentle touch, not of deep color, and you see that cutting it open is possible throughout its entire extent, then empty the patient, and cut into it without fear, without anxiety: and care for the place with what cleanses and constricts, until he is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the Suture of the Nose, Lip, and Ear.
Caput XXVI.	Book 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when there is a separation of continuity in one of these cartilages, this operation is not very helpful unless it occurs in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood. And then gather the edges of the wound with a suture, and care for it until he is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of continuity has already occurred and each part is now healed, then you should remove all visible parts from their skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips together with a suture and tie them up, and sprinkle superimposed on it dragon's blood powder and powdered olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of diaphanic plaster or another consolidated plaster, and let him be bound for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medicine, and let him go until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to gather the separation of continuity either with hooks, as we have described in the suturing of the belly: or to gather the separation with a thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the Extraction of Lip Knots.
Caput XXVII.	Book 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	To many people indeed, swellings similar to grains of herbs occur in the inner parts of their lips, some being smaller and others being larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip, and search over every knot of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from all parts.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered papyrus, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply vinegar to it and treat the place where there is inflammation, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of the flesh growing over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Book XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Much flesh grows above the gum, which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place powdered papyrus or other astringent powders on the spot.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	For if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it again and cauterize it; it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the filing of Teeth with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	Book Twenty-Nine.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both inner and outer parts, and between the gums rough, foul, and yellowish crusts form; sometimes they are worn away, and become bright green, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are made foul by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in the hollow of your shoulder, and file and trim the tooth in which you see crusts resembling sand; until nothing remains of them, and similarly do this for blackness, greenishness, and yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is in them is taken away from the beginning of reason, it is good: and if not, then iterate over them a reason on another day, the second, and third, until finally reaches the study in that which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth needs razors of diverse forms, many figures: according to how you prepare your operation: therefore, because the razor with which you scrape away the tooth from the lower part is one thing, and the razor with which you scrape between teeth is another, in other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And those forms of razors should be prepared by you, as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of the extraction of toothaches.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill and delay in removing it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not as if its place can be filled when it is removed: since it is a high substance: until then, when there is no excuse for removing it, then you should remove it when the weak person is compelled to do so, in order that he may be strengthened and assured before you about the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For indeed many times the pain deceives the weak person and makes him think that it is in the toothache and removes it: then the pain does not cease until the tooth is removed from the weak person.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When then the painful tooth itself is certified to you, it is necessary that scarifices be made around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of power, until the gum is loosened from all parts: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good location on it, and have the head of the weak person between your knees, which you have already held firmly so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments and introduce it under him from all parts with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then you must fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a thin reed so that it does not break during your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must be careful to cut with scarification all around the gum from every side a great deal.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and return to the suffering person from the greater evil which is more painful at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware that you do not do what ignorant cuppers do in their haste and the boldness of theirs towards its removal, besides what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause harm to people's great infirmities, which are more difficult to break and for all the roots of it to remain, or some of them; or for them to extract it with certain bones of the jawbone: as we have testified many times about this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if bleeding occurs from the places (which often happens) then take something from alum and fill it with that in the place; and if not, cauterize it if alum does not seem useful to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of fine forceps with which the tooth is moved at first should be long on their extremities, short on their handles, thick so that they do not bend when pressed upon a tooth: let them be like those you see of gross handles until when you tie them up, they do not bite themselves nor bend: with short extremities and made of tempered iron or well-made bronze, with straight extremities: and in their extremities should be teeth, some of which enter into others and tighten with a decent, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they become extremities like the form of a bird's beak that is called a ciconia, and are strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains to be removed from a tooth that is broken, then you should place a poultice with butter on the spot for one or two days, until the area becomes soft; then introduce into it an algast or forceps, whose tips are like the form of a bird's beak that is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape however is that of a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let the extremities of these be made like a file inside, or like a rasping instrument.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	So if it does not yield to you at the exit with these forceps, then you should, after having cut away the surrounding tissue, and exposing all the flesh, insert a small instrument called Palanca, which has this form.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short extremity be slightly thickened, and not be too wet, so that it may not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	So if the root emerges through this, it is good; and if not, you should help with other instruments which have these forms.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first instrument, a triangular extremity, with some thickness to it.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular extremity is fine.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And also it helps with an instrument having two branches, which has this shape.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the filing of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And also it helps with this instrument which is like a great hook, having this shape, a twisted triangular extremity, with some thickness to prevent breaking, and not too wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments of teeth are many: and similarly, other instruments do not count, and a skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds an instrument for himself according to what the operation demands and the illness itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since there are illnesses that ancient physicians did not mention and for which they did not invent an instrument, on account of the diversity of those diseases.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone is broken from the jawbone or from other bones of the mouth, or it has putrefied: then examine over it in its place with that which corresponds to it from the instruments and forceps I mentioned for extracting roots, and help with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let something of roughness be applied gradually to it, so that it may bind or hold with the bone, and not flee away and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines corresponding to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape away from its putridity and cure it, until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the removal of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course and become foul because of this shape; and especially when it happens to women and girls, namely those with venereal afflictions.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit in place, or its removal or trimming is possible; then pull it out: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small plow, and it is made from iron, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another one from the teeth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its trimming: then trim it with a file from iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all of iron, and the handle of its small points very sharp, like a file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is slowly filed over many days with ease, so that the tooth does not become disturbed and falls; then gently polish it, and finally scrape it off with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth that breaks off and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to trim it also, until the roughness of this fracture is removed and smoothed out.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the Replacement of Teeth with Golden Threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken and disturbed by impact or fall, and an invalid cannot hold what he has eaten without it falling out; and after treating them with medicinal washes, the treatment does not take effect: then there is a skill in them to be fastened with golden thread: because silver becomes green and putrid after days: but gold is never changed.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of a middle size, fine yet not too thin, according to its quantity that it can fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retension is, that you take a thread, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth: then weave it with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then iterate the weaving until you reach the part where you started: and tie your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not come loose at all: and let your constriction be such that you bind the thread around the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors: and gather both together, and convert them with a knot: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be left tightly bound until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it comes undone or is cut, bind them with another thread and they will remain thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the retention of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two returns to its place after a fall of each in their own locations, and remain as we described, and are retained; and this only happens through the skillful, prudent, and experienced artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone from the shin fits together; and it forms into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its original location, secured by the tooth and bound tightly, as we said: and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the cutting of the membrane that occurs under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this membrane that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient in your lap, and lift up his tongue; then cut that membrane-like ligament through its width, until the tongue is released from its constraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if there is something hard and knotty in it, and that is due to the healing of a wound: then put a hook into it and find it through its width, until you cut the ligament and loosen the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware that there is no tear in the depth of the flesh, and you do not cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the incision with rose-water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put a linen cloth under the tongue, which the patient should wear every night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however a flow of blood occurs, then put powdered vermilion over the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the blood overflows, then cauterize the place with a lentil-like cautery that is suitable for it; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the removal of ranulas that occur under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue, similar to a small frog, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and it may become so swollen that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in this case is to open the patient's mouth before the sun and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it to be dark-colored or black and hard, and the patient does not sense it; then do not touch it, because it is a tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is turned towards whiteness, and there is moisture in it; then throw a needle into it, and cut it with a thin scapel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	What if blood flows from you during your operation hour; then place a powdered ligature on top of it, until the bleeding ceases: afterwards return to your operation and remove it with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the remaining suitable treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of abscesses of both tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat's glands, which are similar to those that occur outside and are called two tonsils; which when you cure with what we said earlier and they do not heal, then investigate.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard abscess, dark-colored, with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red-colored and the root of it is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood; rather let it be, until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it or let it burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white-colored, rounded, and the root of it is thin: then you should cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is as follows: before performing your own operation, consider whether the apostema of that person has cooled down completely or decreased to some extent. Then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and have his head resting on your shoulder; open his mouth, and let a servant receive it between their hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, which is shaped as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or bronze, so that it is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press the tongue with it and the apostema is shown to you, and falls upon it according to your sight: then take a hook and fix it in the amygdule, and pull it out as far as you can, except that you draw something from the tunics along with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, which has the following shape:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to pincers: however, its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each one is in a straight line with the other's tip: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron or horn.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, which has the following shape:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one amygdule, cut the other one according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cutting, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if a bleeding occurs, he should gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves and similar things from styptics, until the flow of blood ceases: then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other apostemas are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them therefore according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself was already treated for a woman suffering from an abscess that had developed between her throat and the chin, which pulled towards disfigurement, with few sensations, because it had almost closed off her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and had now forbidden her food and drink of water: and she had reached death's door if left for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so far that it had discharged two branches until they emerged above two nostril openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out and removed a large portion from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it was grasped through the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that to her which had protruded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterwards I fixed the hook into the abscess; then I cut off a part from it, and only a small amount of blood flowed out: thus the woman's throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, then received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	So I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period of time; and the abscess succeeded in the place where I was cutting, until it was prolonged too far with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore applied and cauterized the abscess between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It then ceased to increase: afterwards I walked away from it, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Chapter on the cutting of a uvular abscess.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula and abscesses, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round: then it is called uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we have said in the division, and the cure does not agree: and you see that the abscess has cooled down from it and becomes fine: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is attached to it being round, and it has no length, and is blood-red or dark-colored or black, and has no sensation: then one should make an incision on it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear in her over the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see her according to the manner I said from whiteness and length, make the weak person sit before the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument whose narration preceded: then place a hook in it, and pull her down below: and cut her with one of the two instruments which I mentioned for cutting both amigdalar.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from there unless what is added is above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut too much from there, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we narrated for cutting both amigdalas: and take care of her until she is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is terrified by the incision, then you should use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization there is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, as you put the patient's head in your arm.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water which I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and fill with it a burnt hoof not extinguished, and put it not dense, nor thin, and fill from it the concavity of this instrument, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let its extremity be at the end where the medicine is placed, like the concavity of the ear canal of the radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And put the instrument with medicine on the same uvula: and let the patient lie down on his side, so that the saliva may flow from his mouth internally through the medicine, so that nothing from it descends to his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you place it on the wound as much as a quarter of an hour, until you see it is already healed and the pungency of medicine is quieted.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a ligature, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour medicine onto the ligature, and insert the radius with the ligature into the canal above, until the ligature adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it indeed dries up and falls off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, wash around the wound with a soaked ligature dipped in butter, and cleanse with what is on its circumference from the medicine: and anoint with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this mode of treatment is more wholesome by an incision and longer in removing fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also cured by something that is finer than caustic and incision: it is cured with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calament, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs to these: and gather all of them together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot should be coated with clay well: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which an instrument will be placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or bronze: and insert the end, where there is a berry, into the mouth of the patient, until the vapor ascends to the wound above the canal, until the wound becomes very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then iterate over her many times until she is relieved.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of an apostematic arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often adds to an apostema: and it is not necessary for you to do that unless upon the decline of his apostema's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed and compose its bark at the extremity of it, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the reed's bark prevents vapor from burning the mouth: and this is good treatment with salvation.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	A bone or a fish spine often adheres to the throat many times.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must remove what appears to be on top of it and falls into view, after pressing the tongue with an instrument under the sun, and it will be revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed something attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person swallows a piece of cress, or a root of lettuce, or swallows a dry biscuit: or takes a piece of dried sea sponge, and binds it with thread, then swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore he arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it will come out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use a lead instrument in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be a roughness greater than a radius for a little bit, and at the end of it let there be a curvature which he inserts into his own throat with ease: and he should have his head lifted upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he be seized by a cough, and let the doctor push with him, or the bone, or introduce himself with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the patient introduces himself, this is better: on account of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing; and let him push downwards or draw his hand upwards with an instrument, all according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until he emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the Extraction of the Leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is treated with what I said about cures with medicines and does not concur, then look at the patient's throat before the sun or behind it after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your sight falls on the leech, remove it with a small hook or with gentle and subtle gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	What if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's throat up to the throat; then insert the heated iron rod from the fire into the hollow of the reed.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full bladder of cold water and open his mouth into it; and let him moisten his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not emerge with what we narrated, then fumigate the patient with fleas or with a feather using the instrument that I told you about for fumigating the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigating is that you take a pot, in which are alive prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in whose middle is an opening; and it should be composed in that opening at the end of the instrument.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then place a suffumigation and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the cannula and close his mouth so that the suffumigation does not go out until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-sucking place.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucking place will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salted foods, and others, but not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary for him to go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucking place is extracted from the throat when it falls on its surface.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It resembles forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Of the opening of aposthemes, and their division, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of aposthemes are many, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, namely one and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and division into two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is a type of apostheme that is in itself, and because it contains moisture from humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to locations where they occur in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an apostheme occurring on the head is one thing, and different from an apostheme occurring in the anus; and an apostheme occurring on a fleshy part is another thing, and different from an apostheme occurring at a joint: and each of them has its own judgment according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are aposthemes that should not be perforated unless after maturation of the pus in them and its completion; and among these are those that must be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and it prolongs itself until what is inside it putrefies, perhaps the surrounding ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a more immediate cause of that member's contraction.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess in the main member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that one or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unripe: and it is not proper to open up a raw abscess that is not yet fully digested, except when it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deep and extend to the internal parts of the anus, and become a fistula or remain in its end without healing.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time for perforating an abscess when it has matured according to its completion; and this is at a time of sedation of pain, recession of fever, diminution of swelling, pulse, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and more prominent elevation: and let the perforation go along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, and elbow joints, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged from it, and there are many impurities and foulness, and perhaps the edges of it become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are pierced according to the breadth of the body in necessity or according to what a member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer a small incision to small abscesses and a large incision to large ones; or multiple sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses from which the skin must be poulticed; and when it has been made like a cloth, and has become dead at the edge, as happens to many things that are dubious, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them are those which are cut with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is one that is cut like the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which a circular incision and a lunar incision are administered: and similar ones from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	However, that which has no head, such as mild and superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or flat incision only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected a great deal of pus, to pierce it so that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at once; rather, extract some from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then bind the abscess with an opilum until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something else from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to degree until it drains out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit person: for the spirit of the animal often dissolves from one animal to another with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore beware this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you pierce abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then there is a wound of apostema small, or it is a flat incision, then administer linen oil from flax, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a great apostema and many perforations are present, it is necessary then to insert linen into every perforation until they reach the inside.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have excised a part of the skin from an apostema, or in its surrounding area you have made it concave: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is sewn, or it is removed with flax fibers without moisture: and tie it so that it remains for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it away, and care for it as needed with an ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding occurs during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has been soaked in them: and place it repeatedly over the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to apply a treatment, and cure, and powders that I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the site of the apostema is over many nerves: then it is necessary to soak wool with wine and hot oil: and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the sites are fleshy: then it is necessary to place wool soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we said, then it is necessary to open the apostema, and clean it, and apply to its cure what is fitting for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This therefore is what is necessary from universal knowledge of the treatment of apostemata.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of true distinction, I have already spoken about every apostema, how is the way to its cure chapter by chapter individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the removal of boils that occur on the scalp of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Boils occur on the scalp of the head which are small and are of the type of nodules, contained in sacks, that is as if they were the eggs of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty; and some which contain moisture similar to mud: and some which contain moisture similar to that of fresh cheese and curds: and there are others like these, and some are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all and the removal of them, there is no fear, as long as the artery does not interfere with their cutting.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in cutting them is that you should examine them with an instrument of which the shape comes after these, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a shallow incision according to the length of the superficial cut: in this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from the line b to the line g. When the moisture has evacuated, then remove the crust that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything entirely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if something remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cut in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For what remains of the crust will rot.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process over the cut with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the crust; then indeed apply care to the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	What if the boil contains a fatty nodule? Then cut it according to this shape, with an incision having the form of a cross: and place lancets between the divisions of the incision, and remove everything from all parts: and try your best in extracting the sack that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however an artery makes opposition to you, then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do this in an ulceration, if it is a bony one, by incision and the same treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision above a bony ulceration is easier: because it has few blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these ulcerations which are on the head of certain people, in which there is not at all moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is because I cut above an ulceration on the head of an old woman, and I found an ulcer like a hard, solid, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if someone would strike it with a blow while falling, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	However, in other ulcerations that occur on the head, apart from those which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus may be eased downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then the cure is done with it as is fitting for each one according to its treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Of the cutting of Strophulae on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These ulcerations often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those that occur on the neck, there is one and many, and they are generated from each other; and every Strophula is within its own fold, just as it is with nodes and head ulcers, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these Strophulae are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them there are those that are bony, and those that contain moisture, and those that are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, when you see a lump that appears to have good structure in touch, which is clearly close in color to the skin, and moves freely in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the gullet, nor to an artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary to cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g. and remove it from all parts: and stretch two flaps of skin with forceps, or with many forceps if you need them, as we said in head abscesses, and pull it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is advisable to take care that the vein or nerve is not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula be not too sharp: so that it does not cause you to cut unnecessarily with your hand at the incision, or trouble a weak person, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, then stop the operation at once, and apply to the wound some powdered zinc or certain powders that coagulate blood, and tie up the wound, and leave it alone until the inflammation of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft: or else it may begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is coagulated by a poultice. Therefore, return to your operation until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your finger if any small stumps remain; therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if a large vein is in the root of the stump: then it is necessary not to cut that stump from its own root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a double strong thread and let it go until it falls off without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with the old lint that you had previously soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If Strophula is entirely incised, then it is necessary to gather the two lips of the wound and immediately set him up, after you see that there is no longer any surplus.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there remains surplus because of the size of Strophula, then it is necessary to turn your attention to incising its root and pulling it out: and apply the suture which we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which contains moistures from Strophula, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that the location of its maturity appears to you; and place the perforation below that part of the body that follows downwards, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply licinia with ointment and similar substances after the perforation, so that what remains from the corruption is absorbed; until you see the wound to be clean again. Then care for it with generative ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the section of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Head 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this section is of the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone on earth who has done it; and this is the writing of their discourse.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having synancheum, it is necessary to remove the section of the Epiglottis; since no benefit will come from that because all the veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the Epiglottis, to escape from the destruction which comes from obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do that, it is necessary to cut the Epiglottis under three or four circles of the Epiglottis, by a small section through its width, in what is between two circles, as much as possible, so that the section be in the mucous membrane, not in cartilage: and this place indeed is suitable for the section, because it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the skin until it reaches the canal; he empties the vessel of blood if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the siphon as we have described: and it signifies above the cutting of the canal from the phlegm that flows out from it, when it is torn apart and the voice is cut off.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour arrives that fears suffocation, gather together two lips of the wound and sew it up by itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which make flesh grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse that we have narrated is not explained, except when they see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the sick person's throat: and the sick person has been lifted up to death, and wants to be cut open for his breathing: they go to cutting off the Epiglottis, so that the sick person breathes over the place of the wound by some respiration, and is saved from death: and because of this they have ordered to leave the open wound, until the malice of the sickness is consumed, and it is a three-day evil: then therefore they have ordered to sew up the wound, and cure it, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I saw through myself is that one servant took a knife and sent it with into her own throat, and it happened to her with him as far as the part of the lung's canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her healing, and when I found her moaning, like the mooing of one who is dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I removed the wound, and found a small amount of blood that had flowed out from the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I was confident that she had not cut the vein, nor stopped up the breathing: and breath was issuing forth from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore I hastened, and took care of my wound, and cured it until it was sound: and nothing happened to the maidservant, except that she became hoarse in her voice: and she returned after a few days to better management of her own affairs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting away the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Of the Cutting Away of a Throat Hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia named Hernia gutturis is a great swelling, according to the color of the body: and it is found very much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, indeed there is no fault.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one however is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that occurs from arterial constriction.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this case there is fear, and one should not presume to cut into it with iron, unless it is small; and you must test it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it to be similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended from any vessels; then cut into it, just as one cuts into nodes: and extract it with what contains it from the chest, if it is in the chest; and if not, then thoroughly examine all of its contents.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place according to what is needed for healing, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Of the Cutting Away above Fatty Nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already spoken about all their kinds in division: and it is necessary for me to narrate here the difference between a node and an Exitura: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when an Exitura is present there is heat, fever, and severe pains, until the effusion of excess is stilled and putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fevers and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When there is no knot [i.e. wound], nor heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they contain them with a kistis called sifachin, which is their own bag, and it is according to the color of the body: and it is the taking in of them like beans, and it becomes like batecha, and greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fat or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a knot [i.e. wound], you must examine it and inquire into it first with the instrument that is called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry for all apostemes and knots is this: you should take this instrument and insert it into a more humid place which you find in the aposteme; and then revolve your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last finger according to the measurement of the size of the aposteme.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what comes out as a sign of it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then moisture running with any color comes out, then cut it off with a superficial section, according to what I said about other apostemes.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the sign of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty: therefore cut off above it with a section having the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and preserve the kistin if you can over it, so that you may draw out the healthy part with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistin is torn apart during the operation and it is not possible to draw out the healthy part, for indeed that often happens, then draw it out in pieces, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If anything remains from it a little, or much, returns to the Knot according to most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you and something remains from it a little, then fill the wound at your completion with certain corrosive sharp powders: and close the wound, and place above it what sits as warm pus, and care for it along with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore there is a Knot great, then split its two lips and care for it with what enfleshes.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if there is a vein to you that pulsates or does not pulsate: then hasten and fill the place with trodden sesame, and leave it tight for two days or three, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood ceases: then return to cutting into what remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Chapter on external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are shapes of Instruments of Introduction, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From them there is a great one, and from them there is a middle-sized one, and from them there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron with rounded edges on the outer extremities, so that they hasten entrance into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are forms of Probes, and no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called Beris, that is, piercing; and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From them there is a great one, and a middle-sized one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They congregate to be investigated through these abscesses, and outlets, and fistulas, and boils from what is between them, that is, from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made rounded, smooth, and gentle, like large needles which serve as seats, of course, from citron wood, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better among them are those that are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experiments are also made from black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas whose concavities are adapted to be reflected with their own softness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them there are long ones, from them middle-sized ones, and from them short ones, according to the size of the fistula's amplitude and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of bandages, and they are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them there are simple ones, namely those with a single curvature: and they are three kinds as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are bandages that are blind: and they are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are bandages that have two curves, and they are three kinds: and from them there are bandages that have three curves, and they are three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and lanced: and they are three kinds: because from them there is a great one, a middle one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends where the section is made are sharp, while their other ends are not sharp: and they are not put to use unless for the purpose of providing benefit in the lancing of knots near the fear of incision of a vein or nerve: and so that the infirm may be healed through them, and find tranquility shortly after the burning which is found in the lancing of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdai, and they are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and they are similar to Radiorum, with which one makes alcohol: and at the broad end there is a hidden puncture of Spathium: and within it flows towards the inside and outside when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of skin excrescences which are hidden between the fingers at the site of an abscess: and those who are weak do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, great, middle-sized, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of windsores with which bleeding is stopped: and they are of three kinds, great, middle-sized, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made round from air or citron, about as long as you see, and fine to subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary for these forms of windsores to be at hand with you, great and small: so that you may stop blood flow through them with speed in necessity, and then when medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them for stopping blood flow in every part of the body, and you should only use them on fleshy parts: such as arms, thighs, and shoulders, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the rinds of pomegranates, according to their shape: with which blood is stopped when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflamed at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to emit seminal fluid during sleep) until they resemble those of women: and they remain foul and swollen.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever abhors this, should apply the lunar caesarean technique to the breasts, according to this shape from line "b" to line "g". Then remove the entire fatty accumulation.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with medicinal ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple inclines towards the lower parts and softens due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to cut into two upper sides of his own two similar sections resembling a crescent shape, each containing one with another at the ends of both, until there is a line larger containing the smaller one, according to this form from b to g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips and take away fatness, and administer what we said about suturing and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not complete the incision as it is necessary for you to make, because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a poultice immersed in corrosive ointment, and let it go, until what remains of fatness has been consumed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	About the piercing of an abscess that occurs under the titillate.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the titillate are of the kind of hardened Strophulae which contain pus, and from these some contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	As for those that contain moisture, it is necessary to open them with a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When therefore everything that is in the abscess is emptied of pus, then fill it with old poultice and let it go until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the poultice and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	What if the abscess is of the kind of nodules of Strophulae? Then cut above it, as we said in equal sections over the Strophulae.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however a wound is extended so that it discharges pus, then apply a cauter to it, according to what we said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the cutting off of an apostema which occurs due to the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is torn and the skin above it becomes hardened, it often happens that an apostema occurs there; similarly with a vein, so that an apostema and inflammation occur.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an apostema and inflammation are due to an artery and vein are these: because when an apostema is caused by an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depths of the body; and when you push on the apostema with your fingers, you feel as if there is a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is caused by a vein is rounded in the visible part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cutting into this apostema is an error, and especially when it occurs under the armpits, groin, throat, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary to avoid its cure with an iron instrument, and that which extends from them also to the extremities or head, one must avoid.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore on that which arises from the inflammation of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin in a longitudinal direction.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open up the incision with a hook, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coverings until it is fully exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, just as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temporal regions.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the spot that is between two ligaments with a spatula-like instrument, until the blood that is in it all comes out and the apostema is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall apart: afterward, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	What if an abscess arises from a vein section, then you should keep your hand as clean as possible from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the spot where you held your hand, and make it penetrate; and let a thread be twice as long, until you draw it out from another side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with the abscess itself a good knot: according to what I said to you about tying an olive knot, from two sides with two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with a different thread under the entire abscess near the cut of the needle; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in half, until what is inside it comes out; then cut away the excess skin and let go what has been tied off from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over it a poultice which you moistened with wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment that is done with lichen and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Of the abscess that occurs from twisting of Nerves.
Caput L.	Book 5, Chapter L (Latin).
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in Arteries and Veins, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: which occurs from a blow or from excessive labor, and similar causes; and it happens most often in the places of aiders, or heels, and in every place where joints are moved: and is a grave abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles its color to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is tied with weakness, the weak person feels like numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess accumulated deep within the body, but rather is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go towards the front or before, nor back to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What is therefore present in joints should not be touched with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps indeed contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, as for what is present in the head or forehead, find a skin crease with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	So if there is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape off the top; next, remove it, and gather the wound together with a suture; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Of the excision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people are afflicted many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies with certain things which are called Fungalia, similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is fine, and whose head is thick, and their lips have turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small among them; and there is one that is greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have already seen a man, and in his belly were two thelils, which were more similar to things other than fungi: there was no difference between them, white and small roots, and their lips turned inward, and they were filled, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut them open and found that one weighed almost 10 3/4 ounces and the other almost 6 ounces. And the operation of cutting them open is this: first consider whether the patient is humid, and if the color of the thelil is white, moist, and fine root; then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready in your fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For indeed much blood is often expelled during the cutting of it; therefore, be prepared if blood overflows you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see an infirm person frightened and timid about incision with a iron tool, then take a thread made from lead, well-made and tie it with athel to him. The method is as we have said, and leave him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add the leaden strip.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore you should not stop tying on the lead until it is removed and falls off by itself without any effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the root is thick and large, then there is something to be feared and dreaded in its incision, especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware not to presume to cut away a root that is of dull color, lacking sensation, and foul appearance: for it is an apostematic cancerous thing: and I come with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Paragraph on the care of a Umberlical Hernia.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A hernia occurs at the navel from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the si-face, which is above the belly: and it comes out through the umbilical cord, or intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from a vein, or an artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the constriction of the intestines in that place.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a fissure of the si-face and the umbilical cord, then it has a color similar to that of the body's apostema: and it is smooth, without pain: and appears in different positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is as we have described, with a greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press with your fingers, it becomes hidden; then it returns, and perhaps it comes with a sound; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and a violent effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is because of moisture, it is soft; then it does not become hidden when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is because of blood; then when these signs appear, a abscess turns black from the swelling.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is because of natural flesh: then it is a grave abscess, large, hard, and stays according to one size.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is because of flatness, then the touch of it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is, that you should then consider whether the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or flatness; then it is necessary for you to refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and dread, just as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	What if the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or a tumor; then you should hasten to warn the patient that he should hold his breath and stand upright with his body extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs are made on the circumference of the navel with a cauterizing iron.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to lie flat between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel in the area you marked with the cauterizing iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him tightly around the circumference with a strong thread or with a cord of linen tied firmly; and let the knot be adjusted.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open up the extended middle of the abscess above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find the thing already captured by a ligament: then draw out the other parts, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a knot, then take it with a hook, and cut off its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if there is against you an artery or vein: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the surrounding part which you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, making them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh putsrefies and falls away on its own: or cut it when it has become thin and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what is needed from the ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if a swelling of the navel is from fatty flesh in it, or from moisture: then you should have the abscess drained, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with what is needed to solidify the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	De cure of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the kinds of Cancer and how to cure it with medicines: and warned against curing it with iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have said that Cancer is generated in the womb, and caution regarding its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as Cancer which is on the breasts, or on the thigh, and similar ones, located in members to be removed entirely: especially when it begins small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it becomes old and is great, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I couldn't heal anyone from that: nor did I see another before me who reached it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on him, when he is located as we said, is to precede and dissolve the sick person from black cholera some times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then let bloodletting be done if you find him with a clear filling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick person with preparation, where he will be located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then place on the cancerous ulcers those which are suitable for him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, concave him from all parts with the skin, according to investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the places, and wash away the thick blood entirely with your hand or with whatever is possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if a thick flow of blood makes opposition to you from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the remaining treatment, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the cure of Hydrophobia.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have narrated the types of Hydrophobia in division, and how water aggregation is done: and signs of every type, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is not except the solitary species of ascites alone: nor does it approach the species of tympanitis at all: nor the species of hyposarca entirely: for that one is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are already cured of this species of Hydrophobia called tympanitis with medicines, and your treatment has not availed: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person has already been weakened by debility, or there is another infirmity with him besides Hydrophobia, such as if he also has a cough, or bowel loosening, and similar things: then beware of treating him with iron: for it is feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see an invalid person of abundant vigor, and there is no illness with him except for simple hydrocephalus: and he is not a youth nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is, to lift the invalid standing between your hands, and have someone express his belly behind him by pushing water down into the lower part of his chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorn-like spoon, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	The two sharp, long parts are like the thorn-like spoon, having an acute extremity.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something of shortness gradually in it, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation up to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if it is a case of hydrocephalus generation from the part of the intestines, then you should lengthen with the incision from the navel to a distance of three fingers' breadth, directly downwards above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If the generation of hydrocephalus is due to liver disease: then your incision should be on the left from the navel, three fingers' breadth.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision should be also on the side where the patient wants to lie down, lest superfluities flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through with an instrument all around.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision and lift your hand with the thorn-like spoon between the skin, and scrape, as if you were stripping it away: and let the amount that is stripped away be the size of a fingernail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce and scrape until the thorn-like spoon reaches the empty place: and it is the location of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it and insert into the opening an instrument with this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or bronze, smooth and bright: with a small hole at its lower part, and three holes on either side, two on one side and one on the other side: and the end of it is cut off, according to the shape of a calamus, as you see: in its upper extremity there is a band.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument; therefore, it evacuates from water a medium quantity in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you evacuate more from it than is proper, the patient may perhaps die in an hour by the resolution of his animal spirits; or syncopes occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the strength of its virtue, and according to what the patient's dispositions indicate to you through the strength of his pulse and his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is retained immediately by the skin which retains the orifice that is above the siphon: about which I spoke, in order to pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then insert the instrument again on the next day, if you see the patient is able to tolerate it; and also evacuate a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains little or no water left.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient and dismiss much of the water: then take care of him with burial in hot sand, and profuse sweating in a bath and under the sun, and wait until his thirst is quenched: and take care of him with medicaments that dry out, until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the removal of water: according to what I spoke previously.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of infants born with their lower extremities not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone of the infants exits from his mother's womb, and his head is not perforated, or the orifice is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore one must hasten to help with the perforation immediately at birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin iron wire in the hole and tie it; and keep it there for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wishes to emit urine, let it be removed, and let him urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put it back.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is now possible for the urine that flows over the place not to allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is constricted, is healed with lead, as we said, over many days, until it becomes larger.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those however in whom the opening is in an incorrect place, are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is because the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his own hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation in him, therefore, because the sperm cannot reach the womb by right; and it is very foul suffering.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment for him is to have him lie supine on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis from its original place with a sharp point or a small, thin knife: just as one cuts reeds, or as you trim something to make it like the head of the penis; and let the opening fall in the middle, as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of bleeding during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that way.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So place with him what stops blood from flowing, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	A treatise on ulcers that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and on putrefaction, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These ulcers often occur on the penis, and it is a prominent manifestation of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another is malignant, and another not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore you should suspend the non-malignant one with a thin hook, and cut it off until it is entirely cleansed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with the ointment of Diaphnikon until he is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If, however, the ulcer is malignant of bad color, then it is necessary to apply a caustic after making an incision in it and the surrounding area.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and it is a part of the ulcer inside and another part outside: then it is necessary to remove the ulcer which is inside first, until it consolidates, then care for the one outside; because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin will not secure itself but will rather protrude.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also in the testicles and foreskin a darkening and corruption occurs.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should open up all that is already discolored, and what wants to be corrupted or has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply over it a poultice made with honey and the flour of ground almonds, and the herb of threshed plants.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however a flow of blood occurs, then apply a caustic with lunar caustic, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the caustic is useful for two dispositions at once, namely for a flow of blood and an ulcer when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	Which if the head of the penis is corrupted and destroyed within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert a lead tube into the urethra of the penis, so that the patient may urinate onto it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis, and this kind of adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and no circumcision is required: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or apostema: therefore you should scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament loosens and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these things finely, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the rod and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What exists is because the foreskin when it is thin perhaps pierces quickly due to its own thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the rod with a piece of fine linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with a medicinal wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants and the cure for any mistake that may have befallen them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the breaking of continuity, like other wounds: yet since it is our operation, our will, and its use is peculiarly in children, it is necessary that we mark with it a better operation and a path leading to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	For it is because I have found the majority of surgeons and bloodletters to use cleansing by circumcision with a scalpel and forceps, and they treat those affected, bandaging with a thread, and cutting with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I indeed have tried out all these methods, and I did not find a better cleansing with forceps and bandaging with a thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in the cleansing with a scalpel, the skin often escapes many times.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains: so it is forced to be cut again, and future pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing that is done by laying on of hands, that is, manual manipulation used by surgeons, the cut at the end of the male member is not secured: because perhaps it may enter into its orifice.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the process of cleaning with a spatula, perhaps iron will escape and ruin your operation: and indeed the skin of a child is naturally short-lived, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not require cleaning; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in the process of cleaning with forceps and tying with a thread, I have obtained a good result: because forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, since the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you place your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned and they fall according to the operation at one time; and it makes a compression similar in shape, containing the skin of the wound from every part, with which there is no error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is to make the child think that you are not doing it, especially if it is one who understands a little, that which you do not do except for tying the thread on its wound just so much: and then let it go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible to you, because he receives his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child may see nothing of them, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his wound and blow on it, and draw it up until the end of the head of the wound emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it because impurities are accumulating in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below, for a little way, another band.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb, and use good retention to cut between the two bands.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift up the skin quickly and extract the head of the wound.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better) and place powder above: and on top of the powder, a cloth that has been spread with yolk of egg decocted in rose water, pounded with rose oil.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Recent good: and let him be above it until another day: and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	However, the shape of a forceps for purification is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two blunt ends and let them meet together: so that no branch of a key may come out; and let the length of both sharp parts be equal to the length of two equally matched arm-lengths.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error falls in purification is this: because perhaps the inner skin may altogether escape, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should stretch it forth from your hour with your own finger before the place becomes inflamed: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your own finger, then pull it out with a pincers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if however three days have passed and there remains what is under the inflamed part, that is apostema; then let it go until the apostema becomes warm, and remove that with ease, and cut that according to how it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore cure that with what consolidates the wound from the powders which we narrated in the treatise on powders; and if it happens to cut through the skin above measure and goes up to the upper parts, that will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore cure that with what we said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Of the Extraction of the Vrin retained in the Womb.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the womb occurs when a stone or frozen blood or pus or flesh is formed and similar things to those which we mentioned in the division of cures.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the hernia is not resolved and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the throat of the windpipe: then it is necessary for him to be weak, bent over his own knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then have his feet placed on his back, and let him stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient strain his breathing as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore he is forced to have the throat of the windpipe bent towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear, whereupon the hernia is absolved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it does not resolve with him as we said, and the matter becomes a pressing one for the patient; then it is necessary to administer extraction to him with an instrument called siringa, whose shape is this: It shall be made of silver, and be subtle, thin, hollow, like a bird's feather in subtlety of radius, long in likeness of the palm of one hand and half: having a fine tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exiting the hernia through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie a good knot at its end with wool or cotton: and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Siringa: and cut off any excess with scissors if there is anything superfluous from the wool; truly insert it into the tube with gentleness, like an allazier.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then grease the Siringa with oil or butter, and a yolk of egg: and make the patient sit on a seat, and anoint the windpipe, and take hold of his rod with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the Siringa into the rod with ease, until it reaches the root of the windpipe.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the Siringa into it until it reaches the Vesica, and the patient feels that he has already reached the empty place: and this is not done according to this order unless the passage through which it goes is one where there is a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then stretch the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The skin will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out and make the skin run along the path of the urine; and repeat the catheterization, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	About the quality of cathartic washing of the bladder with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus congeals in it, and you wish to make water and medicines flow into it: then use the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is mute, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And on it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow place, where that which propels is located, should be of a size that it can operate without addition, until when something is drawn with it from moisture, it is attracted: and when propelled, it is pushed away to a distance: according to how the Clepsydra works, by which Greek fire is poured out in battles of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you wish to pour out moisture into the bladder, insert the extremity of the Clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it what propels towards the upper part, for moisture is drawn into the hollow of the Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the catheter, according to what we have narrated about the catheter.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the moisture with what propels it, and that moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a subtle cathartic by which the bladder is washed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It should be made of silver or auriculum: whose head should be higher like a small alcanna, and under it a cavity in which a ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then receive goat's bile and put in it moisture as much as you wish to catheterize the urethra.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong double thread: and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the catheter into the penis, afterwards bind your hand over the urethra with a stricture-decent moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the urethra.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if there is no present urethra, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned back.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, just like an assemblage gathers: after you put into it what you wish from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it into an instrument: and do with it as you did with the urethra from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the urethra.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ Of the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken of the division of stones and their treatment with medicines: and I have said the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and one in the bladder, and signs of the whole: and I have said about the stone where the operation is done by hand and cutting: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which settles in the penis: and I am recounting this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder occurs most frequently in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And one of its signs is that the urine flows out of the bladder like water in its subtlety: and appears in it white sand, and the patient frictions his penis, and labors with it, and many times hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised and comes out with him, anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy up to the point that they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, it is intermediate in young men, in the sense that if the stone is larger, the healing is easier; and if small, it is on the contrary.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the healing, it is first necessary that we cleanse the sick person with a purgative, which will remove all the dung that is in their intestines; for it indeed sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then take the sick person with his feet and shake him, and move him towards the lower parts: so that the Stone descends to the depth of the bladder or ejects itself from a high place occasionally.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared and his hands be under his buttocks, so that the bladder is entirely sloping towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then search for him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you feel the Stone in place, then hasten immediately with an incision above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	And if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a child; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown young man: and insert it into his anus and feel for the Stone until it stops under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger and push it towards the exterior against the place where you want to make an incision; and command your assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in that part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spatula that is cut in, whose form this is.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in that which is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the left side of the navel: and let the incision be above this stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that the section be outwardly wide and inwardly narrow, according to the possibility of the stone's egress from it not being greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger that is in the anus compresses the Stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the Stone are angles and edges, why its exit is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this it is smooth, like a gland, and rounded: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So to that which has angles and edges, add to the cleft.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not emerge thus, then you must use force on top of it: or bind it with a bandage decently tied, whose end is like the Moon, which binds around the Stone and does not come loose from it: or insert a subtle instrument underneath it, curved at the tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot do this, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	But if something from blood constrains you, cut it off with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the Stone is more than one, then push the first large one towards the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push the small one behind that, and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, then you must cut above it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it often happens to a sick person one of two things, either that they will die, or that a constant dripping of urine occurs to them: because the location is not fully consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	True is to administer the expulsion of it until it goes out: or skills with forceps in its fracture, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with tar, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tight, and place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water upon it, so that the hot aposteme may be assuaged.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then prop up the sick person on their neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the balm of diaphanum and the balm of basilicum, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it happens that a hot aposteme is added to the wound, and corroding sores, and similar things, as if blood were congealed in the bladder, and prevented from flowing out of it, and urine fails to come forth with the blood. And this is known by the egress of blood along with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes to the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to it all sorts of remedies that are suitable for its cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the entire course of treatment that you bind two bandages together and tie them up, because of the remedies that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if a stone is small and situated in the urethra, and it becomes stuck there, and prevents the flow of urine: then care for it with what I have told you before, until you reach the point of incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For indeed many times I have been excused from performing an incision through this treatment, for I have already tested it out.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator from iron alferic, whose form is, having a triangular extremity, sharp, fixed on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then receive a thread and tie it to him with a stick under a stone so that it does not return to the vesica.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the stick with ease, until it reaches the Perforator at the stone: and turn the Perforator by your hand on the stone slowly: and you will make its perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urination is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains from the stone at the outer part of the stick.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks apart and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure does not prepare itself for you because something prevents it from that side: then tie the thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the stick between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	After that, untie the binding, and clean up the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind the thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the vesica: and another binding above, unless so that when you untie the thread after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to do it when you bind the thread above, so that you lift up the skin towards the top, so that it returns to your complement, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ Of the Extraction of Stone from Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A small stone is formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone occurs to any of them, then the cure is difficult and prevented by many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that perhaps a woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second one is, because you do not find a woman who would reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or with husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third one is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth one is, because of the distance from the place of stone: wherefore it requires deep cutting, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	For if necessity compels you to do that, then it is necessary to take a female doctor, well-versed: and little is found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you prefer not to do that, then seek out a chaste doctor, subtle and present a well-educated midwife knowledgeable about women's affairs, or a woman who knows part of the art: make her present and especially instruct her to perform everything that you instruct her to do according to investigation on the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, what is most important is to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for her to introduce your finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then she finds it, construe it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to introduce her finger into the weak woman's vulva, and inquire about the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then she finds the stone, it is necessary for her to move it gradually from the orifice of the bladder downwards with all her might, until it reaches the root of the hip joint.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut above it at the opposite side of the mid-point of the vulva at the root of the hip joint, from whichever part is prepared for her, and feel the stone on that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constraining under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts the rod above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	So if he feels a stone, then he adds it to the incision according to the proportion of its size as it emerges from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these [kinds of stones] is small and great, smooth and rough, long and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kind, so that it may signify to you through this above what you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So if blood overpowers you, then add to the place some powdered egg and hold it for one hour until the bleeding ceases.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone emerges: and prepare with you from the instruments I said for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist through them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overpowers you and you know that the bleeding is from the artery that has been cut: then place a poultice on the spot, and bind it with bandages suitable for binding: and do not move that, and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of blood has subsided after days and the place has putrefied, then return to your operation until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About cutting on a water-filled hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A water-filled scrotum is not, unless it is a collection of moisture in the white scrotal sac which is under the skin containing the testicle: and it is called a scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is contained in a pouch of its own, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it ripens: which is another kind of ovum, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white scrotal sac, which we said; and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed, the generation of this branch is from the weakness that occurs in the testicles; wherefore it flows to them this material.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens through a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either it is declining towards a yellowish color, or it is reddish blood-like, or it is dung-like, black, or it is watery white, and that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the gathering of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white phlegm that we mentioned, then an abscess is rounded to a length somewhat like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in its own sac, then an abscess is rounded with the shape of an egg, and because of this a man thinks it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white phlegm, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then examine the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square glass, whose shape has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, then, judge about that which is between it and what emerges in the track of the Intromisso.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to be bled if possible for him and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let it be placed above his back on a high surface, and put many cloths underneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on the left side of him, and instruct your servant to sit on his right side, who should stretch his rod to one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Here is the translation:
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce a siphon full of water with a wide piercing, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook, and stretch the siphon upwards, and do not touch the skin covering the testicles: and cut the siphon as best you can, either entirely or in pieces, especially its delicate side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in the incision, and the water will flow back.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if an egg proceeds from its own skin externally during your operation's hour: then when you have completed the siphon's section, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather up the two lips of the skin covering the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	And if you find a corrupted egg due to another kind of blackness, then it is necessary for you to tie up the vessels that are the suspender, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspender, and draw out the egg: afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If however water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: cut off therefore the other part equally as you did with the first.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do so: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce a piece of cloth soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions: and put another cloth that you had submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and also on the belly: and place above double cloths, which are called poultices: and bind them above with a bandage, which has six sections according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken and moistened, and filled with the linen cloth that has been bloodied, according to this similarity: and make the ends which are pressed out from the belly, or damp wool: and gather them together with a binding in the loin of the arms: and one end takes hold above the anus up to the back, and the second takes hold at the part of the chest: and two ends above the two lower hips, and two other ends above the two groin areas, and gather the binding whole in the loin of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this type of surgery is performed artificially, the ramus (branch) is treated with a cauterizer in place of sectioning with iron. It should be done thus: take a cauterizer that is a fine knife, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it will be ignited, as we have narrated. Until the white membrane containing water is revealed, then take the cauterizer according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Are assimilated Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that membrane, and it is ignited, until the moisture goes out entirely.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch that membrane with a hook, and scrape it off with a burning fine cauterizer, and cut it as far as you can, until you have eradicated the entire thing.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware of oil, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salubrious, and longer-lasting in preventing bleeding, and better than an operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however, contrary symptoms appear to you during the time of cutting or cauterizing, such as a warm abscess or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary for you to treat what is causing the contrariety from that with the cure that suits it, according to what has been mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is fearful and does not await this operation on account of its horror: then perform a perforation according to what I narrate, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain of this in your presence, as we have mentioned the signs, that the ramus is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess on the lower part of it with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a compress on the place, and bind it, and let it be until the remaining water flows out: then care for it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the contrariety is of water flowing out at the hour when you are perforating it; and this does not happen except because a white cloth makes a contrariety in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of the water: then it is necessary to insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water is drawn off, whose shape has preceded: or add something to the operation on the wound for a little while.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and gathers after six months, or about those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has gathered, then it is purged in the same manner and passes through on a sick day.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Of the care of Fleshy Wounds.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision above this Fleshy Wound, there is a fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal will heal from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on it and the appearance of suppuration.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many suppurations occur in bodies, from which testicles are composed: and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from excessive or sharp fluid that flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of the suppuration is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a grave suppuration.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like suppuration, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation to it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the constriction of arteries and their inflation, just as I have already recalled; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What therefore is from them by way of inflation of arteries, is known by the appearance of the suppuration, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	What occurs through venous inflation is not scattered when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible to make an incision above this type and above other flesh; and that is, as you would cut the skin of testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the womb upwards and pull it out with a white cloth: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and bind the vessels; and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the womb.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the womb is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to grasp the womb and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the peritoneum or in what is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of that and pull out the womb, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine: afterwards care for it with other treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	A treatise on the care of Gouty people who are afflicted with Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vine is a swelling wrapped up with some wrapping, similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles. And it occurs difficult for an infirm person to move and exercise, and to walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness is from fear, due to what was previously mentioned.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary for us to say how one operates in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that it is necessary for you to make the infirm person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspensory ligament of the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the veins that are nearby the penis; and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them out with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp-bladed spatula across the width of the veins in a straight section, until the veins are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all parts, just as we told you to do with the arteries that are in temporal regions.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then insert into them a thread which is double, and tie it at the first point where they occur; and tie it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from corrupted, fetid moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the veins that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad by that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens that the veins are all injured, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the veins: so that the sperm may not be deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and wither away or dry up, and not be beneficial along with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the Treatment for Intestinal Ramrods.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this Ramrod is from a section that occurs in the siphac extended above the belly in the part of the groin from the ventral abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend through that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphac or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two kinds occur due to many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from impact.
Aut saltu.	Or from a fall.
Aut clamore.	Or from a blow.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or from the elevation of a heavy object and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign is when it comes from an extension of the siphac.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an equal apostema towards the depth: therefore, because the siphac compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it comes from the section of the siphac, because it makes happen a sharp pain suddenly from the beginning; and it is a different apostema, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course towards the exterior of the siphac.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it issues forth with an intestine wrapped around; and this is called the Intestinal Ramus and Zirbia: and sometimes it happens with inflammation.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and is retained there; and it is accompanied by the destruction of a sick person: because it makes happen a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease's species with iron there is fear; therefore it is necessary to beware of accidents in that.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of the operation is, to force the sick person to reduce their intestine by hand to the inner concavities of their own, if they obey.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it should be raised above his neck between your hands: and lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the scrotal skin entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then place in the two lips of the incision, hooked instruments, according to your need to open the incision with them; and the incision should be such a size as it is possible for an egg to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then strip away the siphac and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphac is uncovered, hard from every part: then introduce your index finger into it, following the testicle, in that which is between the white siphac, which is under the skin, and between the second siphac and without sticking to it which is in the posterior part of the testicle.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move your right hand to the inner side of the testicular skin: and with this extend a white cloth upward, with your left hand. And lift the egg up with the cloth to the part of the sectioning: and instruct the assistant to extend it upward: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to see that nothing from the intestine is wrapped around the hard white cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find something [there], then push it into the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten threads, and insert it into the back of the cloth, that is, the tunic that is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section; then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then place some of them on top of the others in the shape of a cross, and tie with them the white cloth, about which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles tied tightly, until nothing from the vessels that nourish them can reach there: so that no hot abscess may occur.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature outside the first ligature, two fingers less long from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, let go from the white cloth, which is under the skin of the testicles, as much as a finger's length; and cut off the remainder entirely in a rounded shape, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut off the lower part of the skin of the testicles by sectioning, from which blood and pus flow out: just as we described above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a bandage soaked in oil to the wound: and apply the ligature which we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white cloth that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	That often happens indeed.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its case is delayed, then let it be anointed with hot water; and place over it what we said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the wound along with the rest of the wound treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	About Wounds from Thorns.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this type of thorn wound, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first indeed said that this happens just as we narrated about thorn wounds that are accompanied by vines.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to tie the vessels below after incision over them with ease; then cut in the middle, and cure finally with what opens it up, until the vessels fall; and cure the wound according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	About Disruptions that Occur in Groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the swelling appears and does not go down to the testicles; and if it goes down, it is slight and returns to its place in all hours: but if it persists with this condition, a fissure forms in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the scrotum stretches: then it becomes soft and a boil forms, and swells.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with a cautery, as was previously mentioned about it.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the area of the rupture's boil and swelling, with an incision through its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the alsifak and those that are under the skin until the white alsifak is uncovered, which is under the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a radium and place it on top of the prominent part from the alsifak, and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two prominent parts from the alsifak and place them on either side of the extremity of the radium, and connect one to the other with a suture; then withdraw the extremity of the radium.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut off the alsifak entirely, nor stretch the skin, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the cure of intestinal hernias.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for that wound with a wound treatment.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, clean that and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sisch is contracted and no prominence of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	A treatise on the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some people, because of which the flesh that is between them becomes soft and their appearance is marred.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure this to make the patient lie on his back and cut off all the softened skin that is over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather two flaps with a suture: and if you wish, add a surplus of the softened skin in three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the remaining wounds with a treatment until it heals, and the threads fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	A treatise on Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that Castration is excommunicated by our law: and because of this, I would have been allowed not to recall it in my book, and it is not necessary to recall it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that a physician should know when he is questioned about it, and how to treat one who suffers from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need to perform castration on certain animals for our benefit through them, such as sheep, wild goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through emasculation.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the one that is done through emasculation, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and then we cut them off with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In the castration done through incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly and press with your left hand on the skin of its testicles.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspensory ligament and cut above one end of the section, until two testicles come forth: then cut them after you have removed both, and do not leave anything except for a thin skin that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done through emasculation, because emasculation perhaps leaves something of the testicles, which is why the animal desires to copulate.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the Treatment of a Hermaphrodite in Two Ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is formed from males in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is, because it appears as if there is a space, or in the skin of the testicles, between two testicles, with a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is a kind, and it is the vulva of a woman over the pubis bone just like that of a small boy's penis entirely, protruding to the exterior: one of which is like a man's priapus, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away excess flesh until the impression of those parts disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then the care for these wounds is by the same cure as for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second kind of men's genitals from which urine emerges, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor its cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the cutting of the clitoris and the flesh protruding in women's vulvae.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The clitoris is perhaps added to the natural organ until it becomes foul and its appearance is repugnant; and sometimes it grows large in certain women to such an extent that it expands like a man's penis, and reaches as far as copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you must grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or a hook and cut it away; and do not linger too long in cutting, especially at the root of it: lest bleeding occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it by the same cure as for wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that arises is the flesh that grows in the maternal orifice until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and on account of this some call it a caudate affliction.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore you must cut it away just as we cut away the clitoris, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the cure of the Alraticia, which is an unbroken vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alraticia is an unbroken vulva of a woman or one with a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from the preceding illness: and it itself comes about either from innate flesh added on, or sifach subtle, or spisso: and it occurs either in the depth of the matrix, or in its sides, or above it, or below it: and it prevents copulation and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of this is obtained through the observation of a midwife if the obstruction appears to be nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obstruction is from subtle sifach and is near two lips: then hasten and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you should place poultices on both lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands together, and the woman should be placed on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch open the two lips with force until the subtle sifach is torn apart and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman sit every day so that the place does not harden again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the sifach is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula similar to a leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the obstruction is from innate flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it open: and be accompanied by medicines that calm the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and lily-aggregate with owl's white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a leaden cannula, wide, so that the wound does not quickly become inflamed, and keep it for several days: and then apply linseed from dry flax, and take care of the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this method: while not an apostematic cancer exists apostemata cancerosa are not made contrary with iron entirely.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the care of hemorrhoids, Athelila's and Bothor's red boils on women's faces.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of venous openings, until much blood flows out of them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids are aged, they become thickened; and I said previously in the division of their kinds and signs; and I will say here which of them receive treatment and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the vaginal opening and do not appear to the sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those however that are in the vaginal opening above which sense falls are those that are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore one should put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athelila with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powderize over them at the flow of blood from one cut powder without cauterization: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	What if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and walnut bark, and galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with this, it is good; and if not, make poultices stick to her back, and breasts, without cauterization.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarar, or the juice of the tongue-licked reed, that is, aglantine, Pontic wine, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the swelling subsides, then care for the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The albarmuth, however, is red and resembles the heads of hedgehogs, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary to cut off what appears from it, according to what I said in equal proportions; and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	A passage about perforation of the uterus which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of swelling occur in the womb, such as cancer, stone-like swelling, ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, abscesses, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, and thelils, and hot swelling.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I indeed have already spoken about all these afflictions and their kinds, and the signs of each, and their cures in a division; it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about hot swelling which occurs in the womb, when it arises from swellings that collect pus, and it is necessary to know how its opening with iron is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the swelling in its beginning is sharp with percussion and heat and fever, and you see it red; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with perforation of it; and care for it along with it as long as it is beneficial for maturation, until the acuteness of the accident subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair which has two armrests, and recline or lean back against her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly; and her hips should be spread apart, and she should put her arms under her knees, and bind each one with suitable binding to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife will sit on the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes after those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you insert it with the radius deep into the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary to place pillows under the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented. And it is necessary to place a cushion which runs along the instrument on the upper side; and to hold the instrument and to have the servant turn the cushion, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the Exitura appears and is touched by hand and is soft and smooth: then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the lochia is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a lint soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some stimulating quality, into the wound; and put the lint, and draw out the section in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it externally on the womb, and on the back a clean woolen cloth soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then care for it after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb and wound are washed, so that they are anointed with water and honey: then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, rather cure it with that which we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Teachings of Obstetrics, how midwives should treat living embryos, according to their unnatural form that has emerged.
Caput Lxxu.	Head 70th.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the natural form of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore the sign of it is, that when you see a woman compressed downwards and desires to breathe air, and is relieved above what is above her in childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you will know that this birth is natural and its issue is over its head, and the umbilical cord with it, either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress her belly so that the embryo may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the umbilical cord also descends with it, and is purged from those excessences by a good purgation.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But whoever is outside of this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges under its own feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot: or it emerges with its head and hands; or it emerges ventrally; and perhaps it turns over onto its neck, and similar things from unnatural forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form among them, and how it is a sign in it, and what it signifies by that, and stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its own head in its natural birth, and that thing becomes strong above the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or women hold her; and warm her abdomen with a decoction of fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a small wooden spatula between her fingers and finds with it a second one, and scrapes it with her own nail, until what is inside from moisture flows out; and presses the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be cleansed with fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her to be compressed after the enema; and make her cough with a condiment, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will exit immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	And if the fetus's hands emerge first, it is necessary to reduce them with ease and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey during the introduction, then place the woman on a chair and lift her feet up; afterwards, strike the chair against the ground: and the woman must be held so that she does not fall with the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	So if the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remaining fetus: and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	Exit of the embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges over its own feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; afterwards, turn the fetus slightly; afterwards, straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of his feet and stretch it out slightly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the hips, then instruct her to be compressed, and make her cough with a condiment: it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge as we have narrated, then reduce the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is obstructed in all that we have narrated: then take a mixture of alum, and sesame oil, and gum solution: and strike the whole thing well with a mortar; afterwards, bind it to the woman's womb, and below her lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until hypothermia is reached.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that already the lower parts of hers are warmed, then make her sit in myrrh: and place it on.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When however she holds the poultice for one hour, then make her sit down.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her cough: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits in this shape, then she will recover by gradually inserting her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, and her feet should hang down below: and she herself should lie on the bed, and wrap her hands around.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the bedclothes, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	What if the fetus does not exit, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above hypothermia gradually, until the fetus ascends to the higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then she should insert her hands and equalize the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging breadthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	She will recover by reducing her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if she cannot reduce it, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her legs with a strong shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment that you prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	What if she accepts the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to reduce the swelling of the hand, and shape it according to its natural form. And make a woman sneeze, and tell her to press down on herself until she expels it.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its mother's shoulder, with outstretched hands, and its face turned towards its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to hold the fetus' hand, then gradually turn it over and adjust it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is adjusted, then place over its mouth what we have previously narrated, made from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to move slightly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit down on a seat and tell her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then tell her to press down, and make her sneeze with condiment.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus over the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends into the mother's opening according to this method with a cord, then cut the cord with your finger, until it is evacuated from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it off from the navel so that it does not remain attached and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inside until you place it as needed, and tell the woman to press down a few times: for indeed it will emerge easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is a rare occurrence and does not often happen.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	But five is something outside of nature and they do not live at all; and it contains them, although they may be multiplied, with one cord: and separates them through a siphac, distinguishing between each one bound by its own umbilical cord.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a single fetus goes out naturally and easily; and they come out with an unhappy outcome, just as we narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult during birth and arrive at what we mentioned in unnatural forms, then cure them as we narrated: and let the obstetrician be subtle, and do what is done with ease and slowness, and shape according to every form with what is prepared for it from a guiding ingenuity towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and those that are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified with me, that a woman having an abortion has expelled seven, and others fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What has been done through the measurement of a glorious wise person.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this should be entirely in the knowledge of an obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will come to her similar to that one: let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	A treatise on the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus as I said in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which one fears loss over her: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed behind her back, with her head inclined downward and her legs raised; and let someone support her on both sides, or be bound to the bed, so that her body may not be pulled away during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with oily liquids mixed with aloes and fenugreek seeds, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife anoints her hand with those oils and mucus-like substances; then she inserts it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks with her the place where he will grasp the umbilical cords of the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to come out over its own head: then grasp the umbilical cords at his eyes, or on his neck, or on his mouth, or on his palate, or under his beard, or in the crease of his skin, or in nearby places along the ribs, and under the armpits.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is over his feet, then in the flank and middle of his ribcage.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary to hold the cord with the right hand; and place its curvature between the fingers of the left hand; and insert it with ease, and fix the cord in one of those places which we said, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another or third cord opposite to it, if necessary; so that the contraction is equal and does not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal extension, and not just straight ahead, but rather move in all directions to facilitate its exit, as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary between that, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	And if a part is retained from that, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from one side to turn back what is being retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	And if a part of the fetus emerges, then the cords should be moved to another higher location: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	And if the arm emerges first and it is not possible to bring it back due to its contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then take it out until the entire thing emerges, cut it at either the joint of the foot or at the elbow; and so you should do with the other hand and two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or if there is a constriction at birth, or if water has gathered on its head; then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a spathula with thorns, and cut with it the head, and draw out the water: or break it off with an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes along with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	He should do similarly if the fetus has a natural large head; then it is necessary to remove the afterbirth: or take it out with a misdac, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head emerges and is constricted at the neck; then it should be cut, until the moisture that is in the chest flows out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not unfold or comply with birth; then cut the head in pieces, as much as you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if the lower part of the abdomen is apostematic, or there is dropsy within; then it is necessary to puncture it, until the moisture flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted in the belly or chest; then it is necessary to take it out with a cloth that you wrapped around your hand: and cut the belly or chest, until what is within them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns; then the obstetrician should insert their left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	So if the mother's mouth is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the uterus and seek out the head with it, and grasp it with your fingers up to the mother's mouth: then insert one or two hooks into it, and pull it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the womb's opening is obstructed due to a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then one should not work on it, but rather administer a flowing of moist things, fatty substances. And apply poultices. And have them sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to adjust it; then what we said for a living fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then cut quickly and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And one should not leave anything of the afterbirth entirely inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there occurs bleeding, then let it flow into cooling waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant with another one in its place, and again the other fetus died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then an abscess occurred to her after a long time in her navel, and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called upon for its treatment, and I treated her for a long time; and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed on it some poultices of strong attraction, and the bone came out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones from her, while she was in better condition than before; and now after a long time has passed, she is sending forth pus from the site.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this foreign thing here unless there is knowledge and assistance for what the medical craftsman administers with his hand in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	About the shapes of necessary instruments in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter Seventy-Seven.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the shape of the Straightener, with which books are adjusted, having two handles at the two ends of two woods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this handle ought to be subtler than the Straightener; and it should be made either of ebony or of busse wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all wood should be almost two fingers; and the edge of each of them is almost one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half; and in the middle of the two woods are two additions made of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is almost two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are introduced into the maternal opening, so that it may be opened with them when you revolve the two Handles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Handle by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, subtler and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or busse wood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, just as you see here above: and the length of all these additions is almost a palm; and the width of each one is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with this, then make her sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the opening between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined together into the womb; and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity which you wish from opening the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of the other type of whirlpool which the ancients called the driving form, by which the fetus is driven forward.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, where the great head is crushed and resembles a forceps with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made obtuse, like a forceps according to this form, as you see, with teeth like those of a saw, by which it is inserted and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac where the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two wide Spatumilii.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised and the more their kinds multiply and are prepared by the craftsman, the swifter they are for their operation and higher among people, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let it be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Of the Extraction of the Secondina.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secondina is retained at birth, then it is necessary to hasten the weak [or feeble] so that it may retain its breathing.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with what you have condensed: and bind your hand over her mouth, and nose itself.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it therefore goes out through this, it is well.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and pierce in the cover a hole; and put into it herbs opening the womb, such as calament, rue, and anise, and chamomile, and sassafras, and cedar wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put the reed's gum on top of the hole in the pot's cover, and another end into the womb; and hold it until the steam reaches the drying of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For indeed the Secundina will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or aloe juice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert her hand into the womb, and search for the Secundina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then take it and stretch it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert your hand, as we have described, until you find the Secundina and pull it out gradually straight ahead, so that the womb does not fall under strong attraction. Rather, it should be pulled with ease to the right and left sides: then add it in proportion to the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then it will obey, and be saved, and depart from its adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	And if the womb is constricted, as we have already described: cure it with sneezing and by means of the pot's medicine with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself over her in repeated extractions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	True, it is necessary to bind what comes out from the womb to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint it with the tetrapharmaco ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will corrupt it after a few days and dissolve it, and it will be eliminated.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it putsrefies, a bad smell arises from it to the stomach and head, and injures that sick person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	However some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of tansy and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the menses and secondines.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it from a piece of vitriol similar to alcama, or from cinnabar; and place the broad end on the fire: and let the fumigation be placed above the coals; hold it until that fumigation is consumed, and then repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the healing of an unperforated hernia.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with unperforated hernias, which have been bound by the thin membrane of sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforates that membrane with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatula; and beware of getting a burn, lest she touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will strangle, then place a lead tube into the hole and leave it for many days, and remove it when the child wants to urinate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And also hernia occurs from the consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary to cut open that consolidation, and then it should be healed with what we said earlier about healing and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the healing of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Here is the translation:
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodation and Grossitude which occur near the anus outside or in a space of one part. And it is a fistula, one or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that Nodation becomes old, it opens and a white watery moisture or thin pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out through stool and vomiting when an infirm person uses a toilet: and perhaps a worm comes out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas among these when they are penetrating into the space up to the bladder and up to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are fistulas among these that penetrate as far as the joint of the hip and as far as the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	But from this by which you can know whether the fistula penetrates to the anus or not, is when you insert your index finger into the anus and also insert a thin probe made of air or iron into the fistula, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	And if there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin probe made of lead or a brush made of horsehair, until you feel the probe or brush with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	And if you do not feel it thoroughly, nor does anything come out from the orifice through stool, vomiting, or worm as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urethra: then its significance is the flow of urine from it and prevention of this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating to the joint of the hip or to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that the probe reaches there if there is no twisting up to the socket: and finding pain around the part, and pus always coming out from it: and that medicine does not work in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And for these fistulas that penetrate everywhere, there is no cure at all. And the cure of them is toil and futility for foolish physicians, who are formed against him.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But for those that are not penetrating and not old, there is hope of a cure with a probe: according to what I tell you, and I have already tried it; and thus the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and lift up his legs as far above his hip-bones, and let his hip-bones be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or air probe into the fistula, if there is curvature in it, until you know where it reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the sick man feels it around his anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	Therefore, if you feel with your finger that the probe has already penetrated by itself and detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the skin or flesh: then you are certain to know that it is penetrating. Therefore, do not trouble yourself about it, since there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, it is said that the flesh is healed in some people through medication and the benefit that is hoped for from it. The method is to apply a fine cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert the burning iron into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times until you know that all those charred and filtered flesh pieces, which are similar to a bird's feather canal, have been completely consumed.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with linen bandages wrapped in butter until those charred flesh pieces emerge: then treat it with ointments that produce flesh and consolidate.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be cured with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it protrudes out and does not reach up to your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick skin or membrane of flesh between it and the protrusion or fistula: and you see a fistula on the surface of the skin, then cut the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the tenta that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the tenta ends, and the tenta is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh parts, which are similar to a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overcomes you and prevents you from operating between yourself and the operation, so that you must cut those flesh parts: then it is better to do so and provide more rapid relief by cauterizing it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterizing with fire brings together good habits, adds dryness to those added flesh parts, and absorbs blood and dries up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for that with linen cloths wrapped in butter or crushed cauls, until the place discharges pus, and those dry flesh parts emerge into pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments that produce hard flesh, and there are medicines that have astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed; and you should not fear recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and is distant from the surplus of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	So if you feel the tenta and between you and it is a membrane of flesh or skin, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation in that case, unless according to the way of faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is because it is administered in one of three ways: either you cauterize it as we said: or cut it until you reach its concavity, so that it becomes possible for you to insert a linen and effect a cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with cutting, so that you do not cut the arm containing a vein, and a bad outcome of evacuation occurs without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed; or stretch the skin over it and cleanse it after you have cut it up to the vein, as we said, or with a tent, or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh parts that are in the cutting, as far as you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the wound of the entire section and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and a fistula will remain open on the inside part of the anus, and it will be easier for the weak one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is suitable according to this method: and it is when you insert a tent into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus, around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then take the perforated extremity of the tent, which is like an awl, that is, preparing skins, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert a thread wrapped with five threads into it, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the tent with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is piercing the margin of the anus on the inside near, then pull out the thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and gather both ends together: and tie each one, and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread goes into the flesh, tie it well, until those skins which are between the two ends of the thread come to be cut and fall: then take care of the wound, until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not piercing: then make it pierce somehow as you have prepared for yourself, except if it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	You don't have it so that you would do that on account of the elbow, so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with her as we said, until she heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the Spatholimus spine is as follows: it has a very acute curvature and one side is not acute, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after an incision has been made in them, and on the cure of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, resembling charcoal vesicles, or rather they are like clusters of grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And there are small ones and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which yellowish water or a little blood flows with constant flow, and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure for that which is within the anus is, to cause a patient to sit and strain, until it comes out through the anus, and appear to you as an atonement.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore and suspend them with a hook; or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not retained by hooks, because of the moisture in them and their softness: then take them with a rough cloth or with a strip of coarse linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and powderize some hot powders over them after the incision, so that they may fill their place as a cauterizing agent.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the patient does not obey the stool's exit, then use an enema on the sick person with a small amount of medication, so that they may be cleaned out with what is in their anus, and quickly obey the stool when the patient expresses themselves.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if they are external from the anus, then their condition is light, easy; and it is as if you would take them with your finger, or take them with a pincer, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them in the manner we have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shuns cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you apply a stitch to them according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the wrapped thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the thread out to the top and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of it on one side: and wrap two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and be lateral; and tie the athelil tightly strong.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the athelil, and leave one; do not bind it so that excess blood does not flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or safflower oil over the anus, and place it on top of the anus; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it be, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the athelil fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Of the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For many times fissures occur due to constipation and natural constriction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old and medicine is not effective in them: then it is necessary that you scrape with a spoon or your finger until they become moist, and remove the upper crust that prevents them from consolidating.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of these until they are consoled according to what is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a more vigorous reason than the first, until they bleed much, and then take care of them, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Of the cure of Almirmas of turned men, and not turned men: and Aethelils sores, and Formicas.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a rounded knot according to the color of the body, like the head of a key: and it occurs throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it happens from them pain at walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, what is around the head of the key should be cut, and held with forceps or a hook, and pulled out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that thing; and if you wish, cauterize it as was done previously in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From Aethelils sores, one is a small, rough, filtered, rounded prominence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often occurs in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is to stretch out the Aethelil, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it as was previously mentioned with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the Aethelils, both those that are turned and not turned, will be eradicated with the instrument that I shall say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica is also a small, filtered, rough prominence above the surface of the body, going down very deeply into the skin. And when it finds cold, there is felt in it like the sting of a flea, and it occurs throughout the whole body: and most of it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is to take a tube made from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture's wing: and place that tube over the Formica, until it contains a circle of the parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with a catheter, until you cut out what is in the circumference of the ant: and put it in deep flesh, and uproot the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a hollow tube of air or iron, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Sit the upper end of the catheter above, drawing it upwards to unwind the numbness wrapped around, so that its relaxation and rotation may be felt on the grasping finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what is mentioned before in the cauterization of Atthelia in the chapter on cauterizing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	A chapter on the forms of instruments that are used for enemas in ailments of the bladder, and for the purgation of the bowels, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from golden bronze, or from melted air, or malleted.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and great, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children, let it be small: and whose bladders are weak or painful, so also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Great Enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small Enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper head where the womb is tied up, be broad according to this shape: and let there be a distinction so that the womb may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which enters the anus, be mute, that is, not open, gentle, very soft, drawing down to subtlety: and on one side of it be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the threads, and slightly thick, and let the womb in which medicines are placed from animal bladder: or from a sheep's parchment, which is according to the form of an asparagus stalk: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it will be pierced through many holes as it is revolved, and there will be space which is between every hole the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made from raw flax, which is composed of ten threads or thereabouts, and join it to him like an armadillo.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When then this is put into him, let it be tightened at the head of the catheter between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then cleanse with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of intestines depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of cleansing with it is: that you fill the catheter or bladder from medicine, which has been warmed according to the tolerance of the sick person; and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person will be lifted up on his back and raise his legs to the higher parts; and place under him an inthan, that is, a hide or linen cloth, over which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then grease the extremity of the catheter with oil or with egg white or with fenugreek mucus or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the catheter with both his hands simultaneously and express it with vehemence until everything that is in the catheter is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then draw out the catheter and let the sick person raise his legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	What if medicine compels him to evacuation, then let it be done as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with this, it is more likely to be the last one beneficially.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you cleanse him with cathartics in the pains of intestinal dissolution and his exit is hastened: then iterate the catheter until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids or painful ulcers in the anus: then let the catheter be very fine, soft, made from those catheters with which children are cleansed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a fine poultice on which the skin should be tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 44 of the Head.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken in the division of wound treatment about what was fitting for the book, and I will say here the treatment of those wounds with hand and with medicines according to need.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are differentiated according to what causes the wound and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the causes of wounds are often like a thrown stone: either from a knife's cutting or a razor's cut; or from a blow with a lance, wood, or arrow, and similar things from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that are caused by locations on the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or hip: and similar ones from those other members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the treatments for some wounds, in order to set forth a reason and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple head wounds, since the recollection of compound ones will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head and is not accompanied by bone fracture: consider then whether it was caused by a thrown stone or something similar, and only has broken the skin; and if it's a large wound and you fear a bad outcome from suppuration, then hasten to perform a cephalic bloodletting immediately, and don't delay; and take out of his blood according to the quantity of its virtue: unless some obstacle prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prevents cutting off, then let less be taken from food, and let him not approach flesh nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if a warm abscess occurs to him, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine having purging properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are free from a warm abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent and still with its own blood, and has not been disturbed by air: and that powder which I will tell you afterwards; and if it has already been disturbed by air, then place some ointments upon it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from an incision with a sword, and similar: and its edges are not brought together by poutlices, then bring them together with suture, according to what I will tell you about the sutures of their wounds in the belly.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already detected by bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it except with a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh to its place under the skin. And especially instruct the patient to eat foods that are heavy, such as heads and cooked wheat, until he is like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	What if you find putrefaction on the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the putrefaction entirely and throw it away. Then care for that one.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery or vein from which blood flows in these wounds, and it is not cut off by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	So if you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatulum or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity demands when what we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then the remedy for them is easy, light: so that you may sprinkle powder over them this powder because it consolidates them before they change with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Mode of the Powdered Incarnate.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime. Grind it well and sift it through a sieve. Fill the wound with this mixture and bind it tightly until it adheres well to the skin and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind the wound above with lint, and let it be, nor loose it until it remains sound, so that it does not suppurate.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine is not to be removed from the wound until it has healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes the lime alone does this work when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood in front of you. And it also performs the same operation on many large wounds when it is suitable to be placed on them and bound up, and they are recent wounds with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially during the time of summer, then there is no intention to use this powder: therefore, care for it with what we have said, so that you place over it certain digested ointments or put on it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, a fracture occurs with the wound in a bone and it is small, then extract that with Gesta: and I will now speak of the cure for fractures of the head, as future.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no art in it except to remove the cure of it with what causes it to make a strong stiptication, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves, and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold whatsoever on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is a higher part of the members: and that which cures it should be from gentle medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or bind its edges with lint.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has a depth or occurs on the lower part of it where pus has already accumulated, then puncture it in a more depressed area.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	And if an artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood has followed: then separate it, or cut it off, and tie it off: or cauterize it, if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If however the vertebrae of the neck have already been cut, or the whole thing, and the ligaments are saved: then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over a canna of the neck, and do not touch the neck itself, but rather equalize it, and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a bandage that is fitting, and let it go for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments in which there is stiptication and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then search for it; then if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all of them or as many as you can and leave what is not prepared to rot until the wound becomes putrid, separates, and its discharge subsides.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound has been recent, then powder the surface of it with the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if a bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with that remedy which is mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On Wounds of the Knives.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a puncture from a lance or dagger, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore pus is discharged from the wound and a sick person breathes heavily because of it, then you will know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if there is no great depth and it is recent with its own blood? Then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it up, so that the blood may not be retained in its depth and turn back to the heart and kill the sick person: but put a attracting ointment on it and open it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have an ointment present, then put old lint into the opening of the wound, so that it may suck up what discharges from it through moisture: and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that what forms in it may flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if already three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and it does not happen to the sick person that he has a spasm, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in his breathing, and you see its other conditions are good: then you will know that the wound is sound.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore heal it with liniments and all other healing remedies until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed his healing is delayed and it always opens up, then you should know that already a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So cure him according to his chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut made with a sword or dagger and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then cure him by sewing it up as before if it is large; or with powder if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if he has already made an impression on the bone and fragments have fallen out: then examine the wound and hurry to remove those fragments if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separate, then leave them alone until the wound becomes putrid, for their removal would only be an annoyance.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	As for other accidents of wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is that which we have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On Wounds of the Belly and Exit of Intestines and their Issues.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore from a great disruption sometimes the intestine or the number of intestines goes forth.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Wherefore their introduction and suture is more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not hurry to introduce them into their place immediately, since they are inflated, opened, and swollen; therefore the entrance of them becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, it follows that a medium-sized disruption is better: since with it the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult, as it does in these two cases.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the suture of the belly and in the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly communicate with other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, these are more proper with stitches for the belly; and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when a wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it then, that is due to one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the narrowness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation within the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary to warm it up, so that you would immerse a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil wild madder, and cypress, and asafoetida, and mix with them the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it makes that wine which has astringency, and it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which alum or mulberry has been cooked.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that it is alleviated its entrance with a small quantity.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however it resists return after this cure, then find a little bit in the disruption with an instrument used to cut off hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared than when cutting: and there is no forcing to cut after necessity and deficiency of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let that part of it be one which is twisted, acute, and the other part not acute, and let the extremity be subtle, but not with the subtlety of a Scythian, rather be somewhat obtuse: and that is what resembles a caiada, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction should be according to its natural shape in its own proper place, if possible above it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen: then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen: then place your intention and your attention always on this, that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary to do so in great wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, do it as you are prepared for.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious servant present between your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand and gathers its edges.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove something from it to the one who follows in suturing, something after something: and this is the common method of suture for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle or a number of needles according to the size and depth of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the edge of the disruption the length of a ring finger, that is, of a doctor: and fix one needle so that you insert it into the skin on both sides at the edges of the cutaneous layer, with two edges of the sifac, as much as is under the skin from the inside out, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already gathered together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the sifac: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from both sides at once, until the two edges of the wound are gathered together in a decent manner.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in them: afterwards tie it with a thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore you should not stop doing that with him whom you need from splints until you complete the constriction of the wound altogether.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And they should be of medium thickness between grossness and subtlety: because very fine needles quickly pierce flesh: and thick ones have difficulty entering the skin: therefore they ought to be of medium thickness in subtlety and grossness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary for the needle to be stuck in two nearby parts of the skin: so that the flesh may not be pierced quickly and the wound may not be opened before its own consolidation, and also when sutured, in order that the wound may not prevent its own consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the splints so that they do not harm the patient in his sleep: and place small pieces of cloth from all parts on them which hold the extremities of the splints: and let them be, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with splints is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because it is enough for the suture to have one or two needles, or roughly that many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second suture is common, that you gather with one suture four extremities: two of skin and two of silk wound in one place, with a needle in which there is an evenly wrapped thread of equal subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the part where you began, so that the thread is released from the upper part of the wound: in order that it be a suture, like a suture of cloth by which cloths are sewn together, and place between every suture the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	People know this kind of suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I closed the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a larger disruption than the width of one palm: and something like two palms had come out from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I made it repair after his intestine stood outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in so much time as it was, being around 15 days; and I took care of it, and he recovered: and he lived many years after that, living according to his habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, since I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where I could not find any ointment, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I placed a piece of old linen cloth on the wound twice a day, and persisted with washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	However, I will mention two kinds of stitches suitable for this narrative.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp stitch: and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle enters the skin and follows the course of a tendon going according to the length and width of the entire body: let the end be left at the side where you inserted the needle, and make it pass through the other extremity from the inner part to the outer in the opposite direction.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity of the mirror on the outside to the inside: and leave the end at that side, and make the needle enter the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate into the edge of the mirror which is on its part, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and take it along with the end which is from the edge of the mirror on another side, and pull out the needle from the skin as far as it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin and join the end of the mirror which is on the other side with this end: and pull out the needle from the skin as far as it has penetrated from its part, and do it in reverse once and again: and do it in reverse after reverse, until you have brought all the external parts together according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the highest point of this suturing is that you should make your sutures like those of pelt-makers who sew pelts: so that on one side of the skin, you join it together with a single thread from end to end; and then leave it off on another side and tie it back again on another until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture, which Galenus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the way he said it should be done, by likening it to how certain physicians sew together, so that they join all parts together with their corresponding natural counterparts: and they apply the end of one piece to the end of another, and the end of one thing to the end of another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I am telling you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should insert the point of the needle into the end of the thread that is nearest to you on the outer part, and make it penetrate only as far as the inside; and then let go the two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn back the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part on both ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn back both and make them penetrate from the inner part to the outer part on the other two ends of the thread, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better and easier common suture, and it is the suture which was previously mentioned.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This then is the word of Galenus also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is to say that you should insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is at your end, and make it penetrate until the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leather evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly: then the suture of it is more difficult than of other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	For when you follow a recent wound with its blood, before it is altered by air: and bring out the intestine, and put it back in its place, and bind it tightly; then place it on humectated powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already altered the wound: then place on it certain ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus; and let the strings fall off, and be consoled by sifac, and myrrh.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as you would with other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have medicines present, then place on it immediately, as soon as it begins to emit pus, old cotton; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many cases when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you are afraid that the wound may spread to principal limbs with injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft woolen cloth in temperate warm oil or rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	For if it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often occurs) then cleanse it with a stiptic wine, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and is making an exit that penetrates to its hollow.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the thick intestine is easier to heal from: and what comes from the thin one is more difficult to heal from.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine which is called Jeyun does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is due to its multitude, which comes from veins, and the magnitude of those, and due to the subtlety of its body, and proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however that which proceeds from the wound is pus, and you subsequently find it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, whereby you reduce intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if a time has passed and it has become green or black: then it is necessary to bind it with thread above the place that has been discolored from it, so that bleeding does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is outside of that ligament and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its attraction to you may be alleviated, and its extraction at the case of the pus and discharge of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Memorial of a wound which occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible to be restored in some people: therefore, since I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with the blow of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the old wound had been closed: and a fistula formed, and a discharge and flatulence occurred.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I cease to fine-tune it until he was healed and the affected area had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I was afraid for the patient, lest a subsequent evil occurrence should happen to him in his belly: and it did not occur to him from that subsequent evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better physical condition, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and bathed himself, and exercised according to his own habits.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small: then it is necessary to bind it according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is as if you were taking ants from large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and place a formication on one of them that has an open mouth above the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it therefore takes hold on those and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to do that with an ant after an ant according to the size of the wound as a whole.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it [the formication] and close the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until it is nourished by the intestine, and is healed, so that no harm comes to the patient completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to suture the intestine also with a fine thread: which has been taken from an animal's intestine, and attached to it after it has been inserted into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine and scrape off a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the fine linen thread to its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the wound and close with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to its place.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestine is not except by the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that a wound which is great, wide, especially if it is on one of the thin intestines: then there is no skill except to make it finer, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ On the treatment of Ulcers, and Fissures.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound or apostema when it becomes old and worn out, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not cut away: then it is called universally whatever member it may be in a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is a true knot, filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, like the hollow of a bird's feather. And because of this, some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours watery, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is broken up in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already spoken of the division, when I mentioned wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow over it, is not that except for one reason out of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is because there is a lack of blood in the body: or because it is evil itself: or because there is hard flesh between it and its edges, preventing the growth of flesh: or because it is filled with many foul things and filth: or because the wound within itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used in its cure is unsuitable: or because a corrupting influence falls upon the region, such as occurs in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of illnesses is difficult and healing of ulcers delayed by nature: or because there is one bone or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in division: and it is necessary for me to make you know the cure of a fistula and zuke, which occurs through the way of operation by hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You should know that a fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of these are fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or the intestines, or bladder, or to some part of the ribs: or to some part of the vertebrae, or to some joint composed of joints: such as hands and feet: and among them are those that go to the proximity of the main member, and similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	What therefore is among these abscesses, difficult to heal, is from illnesses that do not receive healing, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from an abscess which depth does not reach the places I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to come to knowledge of it, then take a tent made of air or iron, if the abscess extends straight forward, and explore it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is twisting in the abscess, then investigate it with a fine leaden tent.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead is eased by the softness of its body and curves around the twisting shape.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	For if the abscess has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate above it with a tent.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, inject a medicament through one of its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you inject it goes towards other openings and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, by diligent inquiry, find out how it is possible for you to know that there is an opening or a nerve, and that the abscess is far or near, or whether it is one abscess with many openings, and standing above all that, with the utmost fortitude of yours: with your questioning of the patient, and discovery of pain at compression by your hand on the spot, and similar signs and causes of apostema.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have stood above all those things with a true understanding, then go to the cure according to your confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if the abscess appears near or in a safe distant place from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you about: then cut the abscess according to what was previously said in my narrative, and remove what is in it through filtration, and corrupted flesh, which arises in its opening from the flesh, or fat, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however a fistula is of great depth and straightness: then it is necessary to cut into its depth as much as you can.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all the corrupted flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a linseed wrapped in sharp medicine: and insert it as far as the concavity of the fistula that you have grasped with forceps: do this several times, until the sharp medicine has eaten away all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you have identified it in yourself: then investigate it, and cut into it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from doing so on account of a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore a bone is revealed to you and it has something of corruption and blackening: then scrape it away until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what helps to cover it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal and discharges pus as before: then you will know that you have not reached the total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore remove again above it, and make a thorough examination of its condition, and purification of itself with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it is healed, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is in a deep recess of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not within your power to cure it, unless you leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the small bone is corrupted and it is possible for you, then draw it out with fine forceps that fit it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then make a careful attempt to attract them all, and do not leave anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something from the moistures is opposed to you, and there is no fear or mistake in their cutting: then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you do not have preparation for removing the bones from your hour, then place over the wound that will make it rot, and leave it until it rots what is around those bones of flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it may not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place on top of it, if you fear, a poultice submerged in powdered sulfur mixed with oil: or a poultice submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures decay, and the bones separate from them, the removal of these is eased, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the shinbone or hipbone, and similar to those, and what has decayed from it is a major part: then scrape it off with the last rasp until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however what has decayed from it is a major part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw through it, and cut all the way to the point where corruption has reached: then care for it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you of Zukan, what befell a man on his shin: that you may place it as an example and aid to your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of around thirty years old who suffered from pain in his shin, caused by something that had moved inside his body, namely the internal parts, until they reached his leg and became inflamed with great inflammation. And it was not caused by an external factor.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore it was extended with him until a certain time, together with an error of physicians, until an abscess is opened, and many materials concurred with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that, his treatment was suspended until his leg was tunneled and many openings were made in him; which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore a multitude of physicians treated him for almost two years, and there was no wisdom in their hands until I was summoned, and I saw his leg and the materials flowing from those openings with great flow; also every part of his body had already become gangrenous, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I introduced a probe into one of the openings, and it reached to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they were communicating with one another from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore I hastened and cut above one of those openings until I uncovered a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: which was already decayed, and denigrated, and had putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I cut away what was revealed to me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I removed what was not in the bone except for that corruption which I cut away, and scraped.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidation medicines over a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again, and uncovered above the bone a second time after the first discovery; and I found a continuous corruption with the bone: and I cut away what appeared to me from that very corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	So I uncovered it again above him, and did not cease to cut away the bone piece by piece, and attempt to restore it: and it was not restored until I cut off from the bone about a hand's breadth, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored him with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed. And this iteration of the operation on him, and the cutting open of his wound, was not necessary unless due to the debilitation of the sick person, and the scarcity of their tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death, since harm befell him at all hours from excessive purging.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed by a complete cure. And flesh hard and good grew in place of the bone, and a good arrangement took place in his body, and his strength returned. He turned back to his natural state: and there was no harm or discomfort at all in his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the prominent bone is already broken in the body: then it is necessary that you splint it, according to this method: and thus: take a ligament, and tie it at the tip of the prominent bone; and order someone to stretch it upwards; and place another ligament made from coarse wool on top of the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is on the bone; and stretch the end of it so as to pull the flesh down to the lower part; and you will uncover the flesh above the place which you wish to cut, in order not to injure the flesh with the cutting.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board under the bone below, in the middle: because when you do that, it does not prevent the corrupt flesh from being cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the cutting should be above the corrupted place for a short time, so that the corruption of the bone does not occur; and its appearance does not appear to the sense, and makes another place cut in its turn.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	What if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but rather continues with another part; and corruption is in its middle or in a part of it: then remove all the flesh from every part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut that from the first part where there is corruption, until the cutting continues to the other part; and let the cutting be according to length for a short time, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If there is corruption in the joint, cut off the corrupted joint and saw away at the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no art except removal.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the hip of the hand or in the hip of the foot: then the matter in that case is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, you must investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And remove it, and clean the area according to what is possible for you, and with whatever skill corrects itself to you: when it does not cause opposition from the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that scalpels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare the suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations mean something to you according to the type of instrument you need when you have a long study with yourself.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the modes of illnesses: then indeed you will find through yourself what fits each illness from instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am strengthening you with the last number of instruments that you put examples on which you will cut, and proof by which you will test others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw form.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is depicted, let it be well-made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper curve be a bow, its edge made of iron, and its handle made of boxwood, and let it be well-made in the shape of a pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of Sutures and Ligatures.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Here is the translation:
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not agree, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with him when they are corrupted, or a large and great mouth.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The greater form of the Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The middle form of the Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The broad form of the Razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The Razor form with a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The other subtle form of the Razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The other curved end form of the Razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The small, subtle form of the Razor tip.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The Razor form with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The great form also of the Razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a Rasp and its end is like a Saw: it is shown in many places for scraping bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the Razor which agrees with the perforation of what is scraped from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular and has a sharp point.
Fit ex Indi.	It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary for all things that we have said to be made of Razors, Cutters, and Saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About the cutting off of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either due to an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have been treated for that corruption with medicines and the treatment does not help: and you see the corruption occurring in a member which does not respond to anything: then it is necessary to cut off that member up to where the corruption ends, so that the invalid may escape through it from death or from the greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign by which this happens is that the member becomes discolored and blackens until it rots: which fire has consumed or decays after turning black: until the putridity reaches to what follows the member and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, with the incision of this sort, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the blows of certain venomous things: as of a sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	Therefore, if the corruption or blow is at the end of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not give space to the corruption to spread until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens on the hand, then cut off the hand from the wrist and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the armpit of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads into that, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through and you see him around the elbow: then that person is on the point of death.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that in a cure is a quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do the same with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut off that one at the first joint; and if it reaches the calf of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill left except for abandonment and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting off a limb or sawing it is to bind the ligament at the lower part which you wish to cut off and bind another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And have the assistant stretch one ligament down below: and have the assistant stretch another ligament up above upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a spatha or broad knife, until the entire piece of flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut off, or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you put a linen cloth around all parts and the saw does not touch healthy flesh: so that the patient suffers additional injury and develops a warm abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however a flow of blood occurs inwardly while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put some absorbent powders on top that cut off the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, which is the same thing I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is this? For it happened on his foot that a blackening occurred, resembling the burning of fire, and that corruption first affected his finger before spreading to his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man healed himself after he saw the corruption affecting his member with its madness, which he found from the pain and burning; and it happened to him at the joint, and he was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me and I tried to remove the excess with him, using medicines on his hand after purifying his body; and the excess was not removed, and it began to progress to another finger: until corruption spread throughout his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut into his hand: and I did not consent to do so, hoping that the excess would be removed through my treatment; and I also feared for him death at the time of the incision on his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was greater than the calamity.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterward, since he had lost hope in me, he returned to his land: and came back to me about it, because he was impatient, and cut off his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not tell this story except as an aid to what falls under the category of this illness: and that it may be a sign by which it is shown, and according to which it should be acted upon.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the cure of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the time for its abscess to form pus lengthens until it bursts or perforates and what is inside it comes out along with the pus, and a hollow space remains as if it were a vessel; and the skin that covers it is like a piece of cloth that has been worn thin: and it does not reach its final stage of corruption nor impress itself on bone, nerve, or ligament. It deserves to be called Sinus; and it is not called Fistula. However, if its space prolongs until corruption sets in something of these members, then it is called Fistula, or abscess.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its cure is to cut off the entire skin as it peels away; and especially when it has been worn thin and has become like a piece of cloth: and you trust that it will not adhere with the location due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and does not follow from this its final corruption; and if there is thickness on the skin from flesh, then cure it with an enema: and it is, to consider it at the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then anoint it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinar, parts taken in equal quantities, gathered together in a vessel: and let them be decocted over fire until the medicine becomes red-hot and arrives at a thick consistency like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need and dissolve it with water and honey, and anoint the sinus with it: and tie off its opening and let the medicine remain in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression; make him do this daily until the sinus is cleansed and the odor removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is cleansed with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, that you take the ash of wood vines or the ash from ilex woods: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then anoint it with it, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the sinus is now clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the patient is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of ashes, then cleanse him with water and honey, in which something has been mixed from crushed Indian fig.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse him with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey that it cleanses and washes away: and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this a few times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed: then cleanse him with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take defuminated plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or cleanse him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the opening of the sinus is narrow and does not admit the canula of the cleanser: then enlarge it with iron for a short time: or insert into it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or Basilic ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also large: then close its lips with a suture: and let it be as much as the cleanser can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards: then cut it in a lower place that is inside, so that the pus will flow downwards from there: because pus when constricted in the depth of the sinus prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the abscess as low as you like, then try to prepare the member by preparation that will cause the pus to flow out easily, according to how it has been prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to avoid leaving anything of the pus at all in it; and take medicines that consolidate, which are placed on the sign, fitting for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that there may be communication with the entire abscess.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors directly into the opening of the abscess, making the hole in the abscess a little larger.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread another cloth with soft ointments over it, according to the size of the hole; and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the abscess, so that the exit of pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the cloth completely until several days have passed by.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one who is over the opening of the abscess is the one you remove at every hour, so that what gathers in it from the pus may flow out; and to know whether what flows out from it is much, or little, or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, repeatedly examine the place of the abscess itself, whether its lord feels pain in it or not, and whether there is an apostema in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that emerges over the opening of the abscess, then you will know that the abscess is now adhering or approaching adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if after a long period a fine pus emerges from the abscess, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people among whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is delayed, and among whom it works contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however it issues forth from the sinus after many days as a foul discharge, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the sinus is delayed and prolonged: then add to the drying of medicines that true physicians should make them humid in substance and dry in virtue, just as diaphrenic ointment when excess of addition from myrrh is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest last thing that is treated, it is to take diaphrenic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it an equal amount of old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does the same thing in this action, when you do not have diaphrenic ointment available, use honey when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole into powder and sprinkle it over honey while it is hot.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then stretch a cloth over it and bind it over the sinus: and stretch with the honey that you cooked until it thickens: and sprinkle powder on top of it, and put it on the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with Aristolochia longa and the roots of Liliaceous Lily, and this is called Lily; and wheat flour and Centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them in simple or compound form, grind them into powder, and sift it; and sprinkle it over the honey that I told you, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the sinus prolongs and does not heal with this treatment: then you will know that there is corruption deep within it; or already it makes an impression on the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with Fistula cure, according to what has been said before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the Cure of Fungus and Worn-out Nail, and Additions through the Incision of the Finger, and Section.
Caput XCI.	Here is the translation:
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is a boil that grows under the thumb of the hand or foot: and perhaps it grows on other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When then the matter of it is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and a boil forms a hot boil: or it becomes corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corrupts the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth, until it has a foul odor: and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When then you treat it, as we said in the division, and your treatment does not take effect: then you must cut off with a knife all the superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For a cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the growth of the nail is already pressing on the flesh to the inside, and begins to pierce it, and hurt it: then you should put a thin piece of cauterized radium under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and place over what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn and corrode, until the whole thing is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however corruption has already taken hold in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone and remove it: for it never heals as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what was previously mentioned about its remembrance.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there is nail attrition or percussion, and a severe pain accompanies it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumilus section transverse from above downward.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care lest the incision reaches the flesh beneath the nail, for if you do so, you will cause severe pain to the inferior part and it will be the reason for the added flesh growing in its place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the wound with something that soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the added finger that grows on some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them; and perhaps it has a nail: and some of them grow at the root of the joint or their birth is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which grows in certain knots of the finger does not move: and that which grows at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, since the one that is fleshy among them is so, its cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	What is, to cut it at its root with a broad Spatumilus.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of that which grows at the joint of the root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, the one that grows on the finger at the end of the knots, then it is necessary to cut into its first flesh with a rounded incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then file off the bone with one of those files that are suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the formation that occurs on fingers individually, often occurs either from the birth of a person, that is, it grows with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore that you cut off that formation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place licinia or cloth soaked in rose oil between them: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the location consolidates as needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if consolidation occurs on some fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation, according to what is prepared and conforms to the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On cutting out defects.
Caput XCII.	Head 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Varicose veins are those which are twisted, thickened, and full of superfluous melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body: and most often they happen in legs, particularly in the legs of travelers and workers, and carriers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary to administer a purgation of the body with black choleric medication several times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then let a bloodletting be performed on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cauterized and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is raised and the entire thing is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Bind the leg first with warm water a great deal until the thick, dirty blood has dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of the hip down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, in a wide section.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift, that is, draw out the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the nail as far as the lower part: until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it and tell him to abstain from foods that generate black bile, and iterate the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are filled and that hurts the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the crippled leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert him into the bath; or pour hot water over his leg with a sponge, until it turns red and the veins are opened up: or exercise him in strong physical activity, if there is no bath available, until the limb is warmed up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin along the direction of the vein's section by length: or at its end near the knee, or in the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the cut with a scalpel, and strip the vein of all its covering, until it becomes visible to the sense; and it is at that moment when you see it turn from red to dark brown.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it then comes out of the cut, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert Radium underneath it, until when it is elevated and comes out of the cut; tie it with a blind ligature, gentle.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section nearby, three finger's length away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then strip the cut from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with Radium as you did, and tie it with another ligature, just as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or multiple sections, if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and incise the very last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you remove it from the section above, or higher sections altogether, until when it emerges entirely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not obey you to remove and elevate: then insert a hook with a strong string doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert underneath it Radium: and turn your hand around every direction until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it strongly, and an evil consequence will ensue upon the sick person from that.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you have entirely extracted it: then place a cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, over the wound, and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	And if the vitriol is contracted, having a twisted shape and being wrapped around parts, and it is not as we said, straight: then you must cut through it on all sides of its twistiness, and the places where it wraps itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with a hook until you lift it all out: and beware at your cutting through it not to cut the vein or wound it: for it will be difficult for you to lift it up or draw it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of Cutting Whereby the Vitriol is Healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of a Blind Knot.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like other knots, nor is it sharp at its end, so as not to wound the vein; and it has a thickness of flexuousness, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein by its subtlety: nay, let its superfluous thickness be as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Vein of the Thigh.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This Vein is generated in the thighs of people on hot earth, like that of Alizeg, and of the Arabs, and on dry, hot lands with little fertility, that is, where no grass grows nor tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as it happens within bodies to snakes and ascaris worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's outcome is that which happens in the leg a violent inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is cleaned.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that place of cleaning, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when the end of it appears from there, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead over it, weighing one and two-thirds drachma keil, and bind the lead suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever then something emerges from it to the outside, wrap that in lead, and bind it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	What if it is prolonged greatly, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut off its root before it has emerged entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess, corruption in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently and draw it out gradually, until it emerges from its entirety, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this vein some people emerge in a length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it emerged from a man twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you during your medication hour: then insert the tip into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, together with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated from the material: and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the cure by treating abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it as we said in division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	About the cutting of worms born under the skin, and it is called a Boar's sickness.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This sickness is called "Boar's sickness" in a certain land among us because it frequently occurs in oxen and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is shown to the sense at every step of its movement from member to member, until it breaks wherever it breaks in the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and serpents, namely, lice and ascarids, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And fear is to be had from its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes into the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it opens up there and emerges, and destroys an eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it and draw it out, then that does not happen except at every step of its movement and appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore you must tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong binding constraint.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and draw it out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	What if it burrows into the flesh and you don't find it: then place a caustic on top of the spot with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than that which is to be feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts an eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good tightening.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and draw it out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient uses the cleansing of his body with medicines dissolving bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that produce putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the Lancing above Disease Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land; and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it is changed from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have seen him myself, according to what I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I had stayed for one hour, I saw a swelling move with the pulse, just like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be, so that it is like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain then departed from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour and it ran to another part of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the rapidity of its changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I indeed had not seen this disease with my own eyes in such a way before that time.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However I have seen many who found pain changing from member to member; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything except that the woman was one of those who are from dry and discovered veins of the body; therefore it becomes apparent to my senses that this swelling is being moved.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicieux and have moist bodies and hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	So when you want to treat it and the patient feels that pain, then if it appears to your eye as we said, then tie above it quickly, and beneath it swiftly: and cut above it until the constricted swelling goes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then cure it by excision of the body, and with that which drives out swellings, and bind them up with fetid pills, and pills of serapeum, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Of the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their own kinds and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	And their variety is this: because there are some that have large points and small ones: and hollow-tipped and pointed.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them there are those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them there are those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those however that fall according to the members, is in two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or else the members are from the main concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and liver, and lung, and kidney, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls on one of these members and apparent signs of death appear to you which I will tell you next, then it is necessary that you extract the arrow from there, for death follows him who has it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it and cure the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When a dart falls into the brain and pierces the skull, and emerges above the brain, it causes: convulsions, scotoma, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflation, redness of the tongue, spasm, and a mixture of intellect, and vomiting with bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will flow out from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white discharge like pus flows out from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And a fluid similar to serum of meat exits from it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	So if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and remove the dart if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the dart when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were fixed in hard substance, not in empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the dart's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse: and dark blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows numbness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death is undoubtedly impending.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the dart when it wounds the lung is the emission of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and their color changes to that of a sick person.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And it exhales a great and deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	Which if the dart falls into the membrane that is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs; and a great gasping occurs with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the dart falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food will emerge from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is stuck there: something foul-smelling exits from the wound, or pus, or intestine that is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	For if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is more intense on the afflicted person: then you will know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, other parts of the body, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and rib, and loin, and leg, and similar ones are treated with poultices from the limbs, according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may infer from it about your own cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	For it is this: a man had an arrow fall into the root of his nose, at the base of his tearful eye.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from him on the other side, under his ear fat: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed in extracting more than a small part of it, with which it was stuck in its wood: and the arrow was great among the arrows of Turkish bows, with a soft iron tip, without an ear.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And the arrow was Arab, and it is one that has an ear.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I secured it above it between two guides: and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I have skillfully handled her until I extracted it from her: and a Christian has been healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die because of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I observed the arrow; and I examined it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no further harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrowhead emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrowhead remained inside her: and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not find any harm from any of her natural bodily functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man on whom an arrow had fallen on his face: and the wound was consolidated, and remained without finding much pain; and similar things were seen.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into his nose and was already leaning towards the right side; and the arrowhead was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to treat him after the arrow shot, until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found then a wound of the arrow very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I then probed it with a fine probe and did not feel it; and he himself was finding a puncture and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore supposed that that puncture was from the tip of the arrowhead.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a poultice to the place with a poultice that had attracting and digestive power, having confidence in myself that the area would suppurate and that I would see a sign of the arrowhead appearing, so that I could cut above it: and no accident occurred at the place indicating that the arrowhead was located there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I applied the poultice to him for many days and it did not happen that anything untoward occurred, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime: and he remained lame from the extraction of his space of days until he felt a dart one day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I applied a sharp, corroding medicine to that wound for many days until it opened up: and when I probed him, and felt the slender extremity of the arrow which was stuck in wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and it passed by me along with him for a period of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been widened and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not obey my exit: then I did not cease to whittle away at it and invent methods on top of it with various contrivances, until one day I began to extract it with well-made forceps, according to the shape they would take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it and the wound was consolidated and the patient recovered with complete and entire health: nor did anything at all harm him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may place it as a rule and signification over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions cannot be comprehended by narrative: nor does that book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares little with much: and he also finds what is present over what is absent: and he discovers a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of external matters of this art when accidents occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I therefore say that arrows do not exit from the limbs on which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or through the opposite part of the other side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits where it entered is either an arrow proceeding to a fleshy place and being drawn out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	For if it does not obey the exit at the time when it falls: then one must let it be for some days, until the flesh that is around it has putrefied: and its attraction and exit will be eased.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not obey you to exit, then let it be for some days: and repeat the process of attraction and motion every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	For if it does not obey you to exit after days, then one must pierce the surrounding flesh of the arrow in the bone from every part with a fine file, until the arrowhead is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull and has already penetrated one ventricle of the brain, and certain symptoms of those things I mentioned appear: then abstain from attracting the arrow and let it be until its position becomes stable after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the siphac, then death will not be prolonged to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of a bone only, and does not penetrate to the siphac; and the patient remains infirm for some days, and nothing from those things happens to him: then one should exercise ingenuity in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very strongly and does not obey you to the attraction: then administer a file to the surrounding area of the arrow, as I narrated to you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however an arrow has already been lodged in the body and is hidden from sight, and is concealed from sense perception: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for drawing it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot reach it above, due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep within, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then find a way to reach it until the wound is enlarged and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	And if there are ears that it holds to, then free the fixed flesh from all sides, in every way you can, and with arts, if it cannot be freed by going over the edge of the ear, and by bending them until it goes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use a twisting motion with your hand, along with forceps, to all parts, until you make it come out: and with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow does not break and the extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	And if you cannot remove it from one hour to another, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it begins to decay.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then reiterate it: the swelling will indeed be alleviated. If however blood flux makes contrary to you, then administer what we said in its own chapter: and preserve your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And apply skill in every way that it is possible for you to extract the arrow: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, just as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, the patient be made weak according to the shape, according to which he was at the time of the arrow's impact.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if it's not possible for you, then do what is possible for you from the shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, the arrow that emerges from the opposite part of the other [side], either already proceeds something to the exterior or causes a swelling at the end of the Arrow by feeling on the superior part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: therefore, cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that the forceps can take in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to come out by itself.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the Arrow impresses itself on the bone and enlarges its own depth: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then reiterate the procedure until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the wood of the Arrow is stuck in it, then push it with that [wood].
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen and you wish to administer a push: then introduce a concave instrument into it, so that it enters its concavity into the tail of the Arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the Arrow is concave, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The Arrow is eased by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	What if the Arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove all the flesh where the venom is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with what is fitting for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	What if the Arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to what you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting into a vein, or nerve, and draw it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat a wound, if you see one, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of forceps by which arrows are pulled out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let their extremities be like the beak of a bird, made as if from iron; when they take hold above an arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds of them are made, great, small, and middle-sized, according to the size, magnitude, and narrowness of the arrow, and the size, width, and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of a spoon is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of an obtuse impeller.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is like the blunt end of a radius, so that it may be inserted into an arrow and pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The blunt end of the concave impeller is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entrance of the arrow may be inserted into it and pushed forward with it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On bloodletting of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins which are accustomed to be bloodletted in the body are thirty.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Of Bloodletting from Two Veins after the Ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	The bloodletting from two veins that are after the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafa, and bad old head sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting it is according to what I narrate.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is, as I said, to shave the head of the sick person: and to rub his occiput with a rough cloth in the place of the two veins with good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the patient tightens his neck with a bandage until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And those places are located after the ears, on two depressed parts of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore search for them with your finger and where you feel a pulse beneath your finger, mark it with an encaustic.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the bloodletting knife, which is called the "Incidens".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then introduce it under the vein into the flesh until the bloodletting reaches the mouth.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then lift your hand with the vein and the skin to the top, and cut the vein with a cutting wound that cuts into the skin.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the width of two joined fingers, or roughly that; and make as much blood flow out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then tie it with lint, and let it go until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now precedes the incision of those veins and their cauterization, which was discussed at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	§ On bloodletting from two arteries at a time.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.

Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The patient tightens his neck greatly until two veins appear in a manifestly visible way; and show their pulse under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark it with an encaustic.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein to the top with your finger as a guide, and introduce the bloodletting knife beneath, and lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it as you did in the other two veins; and make the blood flow out according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	After that, place a compress and poultice on it, and bind it tightly above with strong constriction; and let it be until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And already a reminder of those things, and the cutting and extraction of them is presented at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	Of bloodletting from the forehead vein after cephalic bloodletting.

Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	The patient should constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument which is called the Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the prominent point that is on top of the Fossorium head on top of the vein, and strike it gently with a plectrum or some other instrument in its way; and let the blood flow as much as you want.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then loosen the perforation of the patient, and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad bloodletting.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the bloodletting to be sharp at its extremity, like the other bloodlettings, but rather it should be broad.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And perform the bloodletting through perforation, because it is nearby; and perhaps the bloodletting may be broken when it is subtle.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Of bloodletting from the veins in both tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The remedy for the two veins that are in both tear ducts of two eyes is for an eye with a scab and redness: and swelling in the eye, and facial ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of bleeding for those is, that a sick person binds his neck with a thread.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then make incisions on them; and you be standing above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let the bleeding be done across in a little bit of length, with a small, broad instrument, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the bleeding is at the end of a thin extremity, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make flow from the blood as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place a cloth on them, and bind them one night, and release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	On the Bleeding of Veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The veins of the nose are for bleeding that is suitable for acute fever and violent headache, and also for facial afflictions, such as hemicrania and redness that occurs on the face: especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of bleeding for that is, that a sick person binds his neck with a thread.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long bleeding instrument; and place it in the middle of the hare's joint itself, between that which separates the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary for you to keep your hand with the bleeding instrument a little bit; and make flow from the blood as much as you need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind them one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly itself.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	On the Bleeding of Veins of the Gullet.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The benefit of the two bleedings of the Gullet is for constriction of panting, and onset of leprosy, and melancholic afflictions, and impetigo, and bad ulcers, and corroding sores, that is, herpes-like.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the quality of bloodletting is that the patient lies under both [bandages] on his neck with a strap; and the artist stands over the head of the patient, and the patient sits on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then bloodletting is performed on the vein for the length of a broad bloodletting.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then take out a measured amount of blood, or as much as necessity requires in the case you are treating.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do the same thing to another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Then loosen the strap and bind both veins together with a moderate tightness, so that the patient is not overheated.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healing.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	A Treatise on Bloodletting of Veins by Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins of Algeberich are the benefit of bloodletting because they contribute to a headache at the mouth and corruption of the gums; and bad wounds; and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are on the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of bloodletting is that you make the patient sit before you; and bind his neck with a strap.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn his lip back and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of his lip, and the second is on the left side of it; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true: because around those are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Cut both with a single incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if you are in doubt about it and do not know which one is which: then direct your attention to the larger and more prominent of the two.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And do the same thing to the two veins that are on the upper lip: and indeed a great deal of habit is with him: and cut the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On bloodletting from the vein under the tongue after cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefits of bloodletting from the two veins that are under the tongue: it is because cephalic bloodletting is for choking fits that occur in the throat, and troubles of the uvula, and troubles of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting them is, that you cause the patient to sit between your hands before the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue from one side a vein, and from the other side another vein: and the color of both will decline to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, bleed both of them; and take care not to put your last finger on bleeding them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under these are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are bled on the elbow are those in which it is a custom for everyone to have bloodletting.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by piercing with a myrtle-leafed lancet; or by oiling to subtlety decline; or by cutting with a knife-cultellary, and that is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Such is Alnesil, which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are broad and subtle species according to the breadth and constriction of the veins. The form of bloodletting with a myrtle leaf is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening up concave, full, proceeding, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this bloodletting is of lesser breadth and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting of thin veins which contain citrus-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Here is the translation:
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica, which is one of the three veins, is a source of benefit for bloodletting.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the illnesses that are under the throat and neck, following the chest and belly; and it suits the bloodletter to cut into this vein, so he may beware of it and be on guard against fear, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he erred and added to the incision of bloodletting, he will cut into that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist not to cut this vein with a puncturing instrument; rather, let him cut it with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If this basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then it is necessary to abandon it and seek another one, or find a branch of it; or if there is no alternative, use the tendon of the arm as a substitute.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For this one is clear and can be cut with a phlebotomy instrument called Alnesil, just as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform bloodletting on this very one, then it is necessary before tightening the arm, that you touch the place until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with encaustic, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using the phlebotomy instrument called Alnesil, just as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall through the space to the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that as you tie the bandage, there is swelling in the place you marked with encaustic, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	What if you see blood flowing during the phlebotomy, like a child's urine, and it is fine and red: then you will know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hasten and place your finger on top of the space for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then bind the arm and let it go: and let the sick person beware of its motion: and be on guard against its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off and prevails over you, and medicine is not present to you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of flaxen cord and tie it; take one half of it and bind it over the place where the vein is to be constricted, with a ligature and small pills until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then cure it with the one whose remembrance preceded from the place of powder-removing blood flow; and its blood cutting off is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small wound location and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	A treatise on bleeding the Black Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The Black Vein is helpful for phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: therefore, since it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the one performing phlebotomy to choose this vein, so that it will be over the fear of bleeding from it, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the phlebotomist adds to the puncture and finds a nerve, it happens that there is numbness, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in certain people, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you must put your phlebotomy in such a way that you will phlebotomize the section with Alnesil, and avoid hitting the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Here is the translation:
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The veins of phlebotomy in the cephalic region are helpful, because they attract blood from the head and bring relief to eye afflictions.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, to make an incision with a sesame oil phlebotome or a myrtle oil phlebotome: because it is the most salubrious of all veins, since there is no artery underneath nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is suitable for you at the time of phlebotomy to remove the head of the phlebotome just up to the wrist and look for a softer spot; and it will not harm him if he does not find it with the first blow, but rather repeat the process several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it will suppurate in some people if it is not phlebotomized at the first blow, but that swelling will do no harm to him.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the utility of Phlebotomy and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality however of Phlebotomy and its accidents from which you should reflect on how to correct them.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of that which you should know is this: that Phlebotomy is not administered except for the conservation of health, and the perseverance of its continuity, and caution against the approach of afflictions.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that Phlebotomy may be done in one of the three veins on the shoulder, namely, the Cephalic, and the Black, and the Royal.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that Phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, in March and autumn after eating, when signs of replenishment appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And that Phlebotomy should be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since sunrise.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But Phlebotomy which is administered for illnesses does not have a fixed hour; but when the occasion and necessity require it, whether by night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that children be bled until they come of age at fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels beforehand with a gentle enema, if much feces has been retained in them: so that the veins may not attract at the time of bleeding the superfluous putrid things from the bowels that are harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled who is drunk with excessive eating or drinking, nor one who is vomiting from excess, nor one who has just recovered from drunkenness, until that state passes away from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid with dropsy be bled.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and frequent coitus, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and all that dissipates the vital force from bodily or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of humors beforehand, whether the blood is thickened with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then enter the bath, unless something prevents it; or engage in some exercise, in order that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And put his bloodletting in the chest, on the third day, as we said: and strive to purge out his chest that day from all bad animal affections, such as anxiety, anger, fear: and from all bodily afflictions, such as labor, pain, excesses, and those similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make the remedies of his own kind present with which custom has accustomed people to use through aromaticity, and scenting, and dancing, and similar things in proportion to the possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the phlebotomator should sit on a cushion which is higher than the one used for phlebotomy. Afterwards, he should take out his own arm and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie a ligament with a belt, and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when it is unequal, or there is too much constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or if it is loose, then also it hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary for the one to be bled to rub his hands together evenly until the veins are inflated and become apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomator should wipe the wound with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on top of the vein at the spot where he wants to make the incision, slightly so that the vein does not flee and a blow can be struck.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For just as the string flees from the phlebotomist during surgery, so too do the veins flee when one places the phlebotomy instrument on them. And there are some that are full of wind: and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts beneath the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotomy does not open up the vein; and if it does open up, it is constricted. Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should remove the phlebotomy instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If the vein opens up on one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then do the same thing on the other side a little bit away or above it with haste: unless the spot becomes inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it becomes inflamed or swells up with disease, then let him rest for a day or two: and do not bind the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will attract a warm abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he will repeat venesection, if desired.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the aperture is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out: then repeat venesection in the same opening, following its natural direction, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this quickly, before the area becomes inflamed, for an inflamed area is a common occurrence in many people during a minor procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure at all on it, for nothing excuses itself with you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from oil and dung over it, because it will ease the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better here than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer oil and dung in all your venesections, where you make incisions to stop the flow of blood; and it is called tyriaca by Alfarach, and sagzenea when one of them is placed over the area.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thinner and is dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	For if a great abscess occurs at the site of the venesection, which often happens, especially to those who are not accustomed to it except for this occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small; then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly, over the area, and bind it for one hour: because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do this after the blood has stopped flowing from that very vein, when its flow is complete, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	And if something remains at the site after a few days, whether it is black or greenish in color, it does not harm; and if you wish, place something over it from aloes, or myrrh solvents, or something from the sap of calament, that is, like menthe.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed accidents and swellings occur at bloodletting in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand on it, then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	So beware, so as to put something on it from what we said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you withdraw blood from every man according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears by the color victorious over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes fine; and similarly if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that phlebotomy be increased on the vein, and let the phlebotomist be broad-shouldered; and in one who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he draw it out in sections and that the opening be narrow; and better is what is administered in vein phlebotomy, that there be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting into the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for one who is accustomed to syncopes coming on during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eats a moderate amount of bread soaked in grape juice water before the bloodletting; or safflower if he is heated: and let him withdraw from him from the blood in three sections or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is chilled, then it should take a bread infused with honey syrup, or with a sweetened honey syrup flavored with spices, or with an aromatic and fragrant syrup before bloodletting.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during bloodletting and is due to the excessive exit of blood: then it is necessary that he should drink a broth of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup: and make use of aromatic substances with aloes, and anoint his chest with them: and make use of the other things we mentioned in the division of syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	However, he who wants to release his arm and shed his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to abundant evacuation and whose strength is weak, to let out the blood gradually by the amount of their strength over several days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to release his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours or nine from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite side to which it is declining: it is necessary that he do so on the second day or third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body is a great deal of blood already warmed up, sharpened, and causing fever: it is necessary that the blood exit from him on one side, and a large quantity be drawn out: and the opening be widened until syncope occurs: after which you should have preserved all conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death may not occur instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that this occurs when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to release the arm and shed blood a second time, when already the orifice of the vein is closed and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that you should press upon it with forcefulness and cause it to be quickly bent or stretched.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a very bad thing, I mean let it go until it is bled second.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharp bleeding whatever has been clotted from blood in the wound opening, and place something of dissolved salt on top of it in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put something from Tyrian pitch or saffron on top of it, and place a gentle compression on it until the blood goes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If the vein is already inflamed, then let it be, and do not bind it, until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity requires to let out blood again, and there is no excuse, then either bleed above that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the veins of the arm are bled at the places known as Fusca and Basilia, when those cannot be found, and they are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient should put his hand into hot water until it turns red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then a ligature should be tied above it with a moderate degree of constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed secondarily by transverse punctures gradually, not widthwise nor lengthwise: and let the aperture be wide, and let your bleeding be such that it flows over the juncture of the hand a little bit.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the flow of blood is hindered? Then repeat the motion with your hand in hot water, and let the blood run out into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in summer days, then excuse yourself from repeating the hand motion in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is put to a great extent in hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bleeding of this vein is more beneficial to all veins, because it is not under a pulsating vein nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Venesection is the right hand of Saluta's salvation, it relieves diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of venesection is that you bind with a ligament or your own hand the vein after you have inserted it into warm water until it swells and becomes very sensitive to the touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then cut the vein across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, that will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care, lest your hand be stained with the venesection.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the naked nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put your hand into warm water and let the blood flow freely in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not put it into warm water, the blood will congeal in the wound of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not congeal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do this with every tightened branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The remedy for the venesection is from the left hand, because it relieves spleen diseases; and similarly do this with his venesection as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The remedy for the phlebotomy of the saphena is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as womanly complaints, retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient puts his foot into warm water and makes a friction on it until the veins swell; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the location of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb, and they branch out from there into multiple branches on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Let blood from it on a larger branch of his, or at the heel in its gathering, for it is better and more wholesome.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you let blood from it on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it above the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your incision so that you may let blood from it sideways, as if you were willing to cut it: and the incisor is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is hindered, then go down to his foot in hot water: and let the blood run out into it, until it is purged.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the physician makes a mistake in the first attempt, then he should go back with the lancet to a higher place a little bit, for the spot is safe, and you are not afraid of evil consequences when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the vein on the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel from the left side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of his bleeding is to relieve the pain in the ankle when it occurs due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his bleeding is that the patient should enter the bath and hasten; and bind his leg on the side of the ankle up to the heel by four fingers with a thin, long string: for it appears only because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then let blood from it according to whatever nature is possible for you, either by transversing or by making an incision or a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For that place is more wholesome, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the sense: then let blood from some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood flow out in a quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place the skin over the spot of bloodletting, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly indeed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of Pneumothorax, and its quality.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Pneumothoraces occur from horns, and from air, and from vinegar.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Pneumothorax indeed occurs in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting: and the other is pneumothorax without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Pneumothorax which is without scarification, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventoses that are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One of which is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and ventoses Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides simultaneously; and ventoses of the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower part of the mouth; and ventoses of the two spatula-like places; and ventoses of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and ventoses of the two forearms, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and ventoses of the two hind legs; and ventoses of the two scapular areas.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed, Pneumothorax does not extract blood from you from small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, it does not fall into power, just as is the case with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should pneumothorax be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any disease that arises from excess, until the entire body has been purged.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity demands pneumothorax due to illness or habit, we administer it at every hour at the beginning of the month, its end, and its middle, and whenever it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is this? Because there are people who, when blood multiplies within him until he needs its extraction by lancing, find a swelling in their head and then swoon.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them are those who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them are those who find itching on their face and forehead, and darkness and dimness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them are those who scratch the place of their lancing.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue will break out and spit up blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees blood and redness, and killed ones, and wounds, and things similar to those in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see something of these things, and especially if it occurs on the 15th day: then we prescribe lancing to be done two hours or three after sunset.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The relief of lancing the head is: because it brings about heaviness on the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is the lancing in place of the cephalic bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it on someone who has a cold complexion or one who has a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, one should not use this on the elderly or someone whose head is troubled by cold afflictions.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes accustomed to it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, one should instruct the lancer to put down his hand with the lancet a little while after to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is a place for dark bloodletting and basilic vein bloodletting. It is useful for relieving breathing difficulties and chest constriction, facilitating the use of instruments, and curing coughs and replenishing.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary for the Ventosatio Alkehel to be pushed slightly forward, because if it is placed below, it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The Ventosatio alhagdahim relieves pains and accidents in the head, and also the eyes, and headaches, and perforations, and pain in the roots of teeth; and it is a place for basilic vein bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to warn the Ventosator not to press his hand with scarification so that he does not hit an artery and a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The Ventosatio under the jaw relieves apoplexy in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar troubles from diseases that are in the mouth; and it is a place for bloodletting alieherich which are in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The Ventosatio of spatulas relieves alchafacham, which is caused by relaxation and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The Ventosatio of the inner parts of two furnaces relieves the benefit of bloodletting from three veins, namely the basilic, cephalic, and femoral: because it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins attract blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three said veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to warn the Ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification, because the location is laid bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The Ventosa which is applied above the alcausos relieves hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to warn the Ventosator that the Ventosa should be large and made of air: because the location needs strong suction, and perhaps the fine Ventosae may break: and there should be great scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Wind veins of the legs decrease by manifest diminution; for they draw blood from the whole body and transfer old pains to the kidneys, bladder, and matrix: they provoke menstruation and transfer inflammation and swelling. And they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the Alkhoroubian vein.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of the Alkhoroubian vein is similar to the benefit of the two veins of the legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the wind veins is that you place the wind vein in the first empty space, and draw out with a tempered suction: and do not prolong the position of the wind veins, but put them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the spot with equal arrival: and do not stop repeating it and continuing, until you see the spot already reddened and inflamed, and appears as a redness of blood: then indeed scarify, and iterate suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the dispositions of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those among humans who have thin flesh, rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once only, not more: lest the place becomes ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the wind vein operator to amplify the scarification and deepen it slightly: and temper the suction in ease, swiftness, and sweetness.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is coagulation in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, indeed, the way is opened for subtletization of the blood and its moistening: and in the second instance, indeed, a thorough and meticulous extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul, then a third scarification should be performed: so that the outcome may be final.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to draw out the blood slowly or a little bit, one scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract a great deal of blood, we will make many scars.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, and find that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to incise deeply with a scarification, and the equal end of the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from oils at the position of Wind-sores, and what should a wind-sores patient beware.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that person whose skin is thick, hard, and dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the areas of Wind-sores be anointed with open, gentle, resolving oils; if in the time of summer, such as oil of alkeiri, or oil of violet, or oil made from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sabine oil; and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the excess is thick and cold: then oil should be of amaranth, or oil of balsam, or oil of white poppy, or oil of anethum; and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the wind-sores patient is of large pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit them from oil, and it is necessary that those with such wind-sores wash the areas Ventosarum after ventosation with rose water, or cold water, or sour water, or cucumber water, or purslane water; and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the wind-sores with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumac; and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whoever has thick excesses should wash their wind-sores with old wine, or with water of sammosus, or a decoction of anise, or chamomile; and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to beware of inflammation in the bathhouse, or near the bathhouse, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bathhouse for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And one should not sleep after inflammation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that ought to be regulated with the Venosandus or Phlebotomatus before inflammation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is necessary to consider first: then if the Venosandus or Phlebotomatus is choleric and prevails over his blood's sharpness and inflammation: then it is necessary that he take cooling remedies, such as pomegranate juice: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and sycamore leaf, and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And give him foods such as eggs, old meat of sheep, and cooked foods with wild herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And to one whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he takes in his drink a syrup made from honey or almond or sycamore seed: and let him take a medium-sized fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be advised to use moderation with food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And give him foods such as eggs, and small birds: and sparrows, that is, small birds; and he should also take dove's eggs.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of inflammation and phlebotomy be more than food: and it is necessary to give in the drink certain things to some people one hour before breakfast, or medicine made from moss, that is, muscata, or alesselithe before inflammation; and before or after phlebotomy, so that the principal members may be strengthened and the blood may be thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And one should not take it with a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	A treatise on Inflammation without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Those wounds that are without scarification are the ventosas which are placed on the liver, spleen, podagra, and on the belly, navel, and places of kidneys, and pithed anchae: for these members do not suffer scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, except by attraction of blood from member to member: just as we place a ventosa on the breasts in illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to remove from the member cold and congested blood in the member: just as we place a ventosa on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarifies the member, and warms it up, and removes the pain on account of that, because it dissolves that blood congestion.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also placed on the kidneys when there occurs a blockage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For indeed its power of attraction may perhaps open up the blockage or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does the same thing when placed on the liver and spleen with a congestion to be removed from both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventosas are administered empty, with only an incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleurisy afflictions; and that is, so that the ventosa may be filled and be large with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs have been decocted that agree.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of the Ventosas administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The shape of the Ventosas administered with fire is as follows: let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let the quantity of it in depth be half a palm: and let there be on one side of it, about halfway down, a small hole, according to the size that an acus will enter it: make it from air simultaneously, or citron, rounded, smooth, equal, clean edges so as not to hurt the member at its position upon it: and let there be in the middle of it a crosswise rod of air or iron where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this poultice is made large, greater than what we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the afflictions and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For wind pouches of children and those emaciated are different from wind pouches of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of applying this poultice with fire on a limb is as follows: you should light a linen wick or a small candle from beeswax and place it in the middle of the transverse stick which is inside the poultice, so that the ignited part of the fire may be directed towards the lower part of the poultice, lest the sick body be burnt.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed on the limb, and your finger should be above the opening which I mentioned, until we need to remove the poultice; as long as we use it, take away your finger, and a vapor will come out through that opening, and the poultice will loosen immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then burn the wick according to its nature, and repeat this if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the poultice which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse stick nor opening; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed only on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this poultice is better in proportion as it is larger and can hold much water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the suspension of Bloodletting Pouches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting pouches are not administered on many parts of the body, except in those where it is impossible to apply poultices due to their smallness, such as the lips and gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare member devoid of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: to take the blood from the bloodletting pouches that are in sweet and clean waters, free from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are let go day and night in sweet water until they are famished, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be evacuated first by bloodletting, and then with purgatives.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the afflicted member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled and fall away, and it is possible to suck out the place with a purgative, then it is more beneficial; and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it is rubbed and expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of haemostats, and it is that which drips away; then dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the dripping subsides.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood multiplies, then sprinkle powder of bounded alum or gallnuts and similar things from astringents on top, until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or put middle layers of peeled beans on top and let them be, until they stick to the place, for the blood stops.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of haemostats is needed, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the haemostats are prevented from being suspended, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a needle in place until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then put them on, for they immediately stick when they feel something coming from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall, sprinkle something from pounded aloes, or salt, or ashes on top of them: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of the Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	General discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Here is the translation:
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is about restoring fractures and dislocations of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, ye sons, that foolish doctors and the common crowd boast of this chapter, and those who have never looked at an ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, our method is deprived of science on earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found anything good in it at all, and I did not obtain what I obtained unless it was through the length of reading ancient books and my study on their understanding, until I extracted that science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experimentation and lengthy study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you everything that my science contains in this chapter: and beyond what has passed my experiment, after I shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of prolongation, and shortened it at the end of shortening, and showed it at the end of deviation: and I shaped many forms in it from the forms of instruments that are used in it, with the addition of deviation, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections from the existence of bone fractures, from those whose preface is necessary before we begin to recall the broken members and their various kinds.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, the summaries and headings, whose understanding requires the craftsman to stand at attention over their truth: namely, so that you and those who are ready may know or learn this noble art from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore, that when any fracture or dislocation or twisting or fall happens to someone: then it is necessary that you hasten first to let blood on him, and dissolve him, or both at once: if nothing prevents, such as weakness of vigor: or he who has something happen to him is a child, or an old decrepit person: or the time is extremely hot, or extremely cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold herbs, and the flesh of birds and hares; and forbid wine, fatty meats, and foods that fill veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are safe from the warm abscess and do not fear the discharge of material onto the member; then the sick person should return to his original regimen, with which he is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore a broken bone is being restored, then it is necessary for the sick person to be fed nourishing foods in abundance, thick, heavy, and with a slimy consistency: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads and feet of vegetables, and sheep's entrails, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are fractured when the men who are in their first old age and decrepitude are not possible to be continued and consolidated according to their natural state because of drying up of their limbs; and those things which come from them at the end of relaxation, such as children's bones.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue above the fractured bone from all sides, which has thickness, by which it adheres and tightens itself until it is thoroughly congealed and bound together until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until nothing prevents it from performing its functions: and for this reason it is necessary to provide nourishment to the sick person with food that has heaviness, sliminess, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and similarly all other members are different one from another: and I come with the reminder of every species of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fracture are differentiated also within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it becomes a curved fracture, besides the stars that occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it happens that the fracture is according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures which are said to be sagittae, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are on a reed when it is fitted with a pen for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with wound and disruption at the head; and it is a small cleft fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own ingenuity or proper instrument for restoring it, according to how its memory comes, distinguished in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that a bone fracture is known, there is its twistiness and its prominence; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twistiness in the place, nor a sound when you touch it with your hand as you apply gentle motion, nor does the infirm person find great pain: then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that it be a twistiness or small cleft: so you should not move it at all with your hand and compression, but rather place something of medicines upon it, whose remembrance comes after that moment which is suitable to the place; then let it be bound with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that the place when it curves and splits into two, besides what occurs in it as stars, yet every part is removed from its companion: then you should start at your hour to correct it, equalizing it before a warm abscess comes upon it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a warm abscess occurs, then let it be left for several days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any method possible by gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its adjustment is easier than bone, where endeavors occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tie it up, according to how its memory comes back to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are efforts in a bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if it is an arm or leg; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be such that you place the limb on an equal location, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then strive to make those additions in every way and by whatever means you can in their places; and beware, according to your strength, lest there occur superfluous pain or injury due to your operation: and strive according to your strength, that you apply one bone with its partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour for you to test and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see something different there, correct it, and make it equal according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, just as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For indeed they often cause to happen through their own operation aposteme hot or contracture in a member: just as we have already seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after adjustment, and proper operation, and the constriction of that member, and rest, and calmness: and caution the weak person above it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it so that it does not move in its own hours of vigil and sleep, and in its own revolution and agitation, and in its own exhaustion, and all its movements with its utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that it may beware not to be in a position of the member's position that would follow pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	What is this, because when it feels a pain or injury in the arrangement of a limb: then one should move it to another arrangement with which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware that the position of the limb is equal and straight, so that there is no twistiness in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken limb's fracture is, as I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that fractured limbs are differentiated by their smallness or greatness and by their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, what is small among them, such as an arm, finger, and toe, and similar to these, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But what is large among them, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping of broad, thick cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide band connects a large limb and tightens it from every part with equal constriction, so that no swelling enters.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation to place the suitable ointment on that, in a thin smear over the location of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the location of the fracture itself with three or four windings, according to what is suitable for the limb; and grasp your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part above the location of the fracture and tighten less than your previous constriction by which you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrapping away from the location of the fracture for a little bit and gradually relax the constriction until you reach a large part that is healthy.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with windings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the wrapping to the lower part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation will be on constriction and loosening, and softening of it, according to what we said in the first superior constriction.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the constrictions a piece of soft cloth or linen that will straighten out the tortuosity of the fracture, if there is tortuosity; and if not, do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then envelop above this wrapping another one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterward, apply above these wrappings small stones made hot at once, unless there is swelling or warm suppuration.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or suppuration in it, then place above it what settles that suppuration and removes the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie on top of it these hot stones.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stones should be from the middle of a broad cane, smooth and well-shaped; or they should be from wood, such as is used for combs, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and the width of every stone should be according to this form and same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the stone which is placed on top of the bandage should be a bit thicker and wider than the other stones; and the length of the stone should be according to what allows it to fit onto the member by its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie on top of the stones with another bandage, according to the first constriction.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind on top with threads that are well-centered, according to what we said about constriction; and it is, so that your constriction above the place of the fracture is more: and as much as it is farther away from the fracture, constriction should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads are medium-sized in thickness and subtlety, and they are made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operations of ignorant people who put their threads together from twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake: because the constriction falls short of its proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not fit together again: because you do not obtain with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary for there to be less than a finger's width between one asterisk and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	But if the patient is injured at the extremities of the asterisks after the stricture in healthy places: then place under them a soft cotton or a woven wool, until nothing is hurt from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with a wound, and there is a disruption of the skin, I come with the recollection of it in the second chapter according to the particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member should be bound with asterisks from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Which is because a member when it is large, should not be placed with asterisks above it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of cold pustules.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients restored what is placed over fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ Common plaster method abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it is on account of which heat does not overcome it, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the chaff of a mill, and it is the floury pulp that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you should sift it with egg white: and put its confection not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	¶ Another plaster method, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of alum, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of each one anise X myrrh, and aloe both equal V and alethi XX are mixed together, and sifted, and mixed with water of alethi: or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is warmed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this poultice.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, quickly restores broken bones, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another way to make a poultice that also helps with fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe: mix myrrh, mastich, and white aloe, all in equal quantities of 10; and aloes, ambrosia, and acacia, all in equal quantities of 5. Mix all the ingredients together with much pounding, and sift them, and make them into a liquid with water or egg-white: and administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another way to make a poultice for joints and separated bones from their proper places; and it calms sudden pain that has occurred, and splits in the bone, and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take succulent wool, immerse it in vinegar and a decoction of oil, and place it over the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this poultice there is no power of restoration, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess and expelling pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another way to make a poultice that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of mulberry and the leaves of Silkworm tree; and grind all into a fine powder, and make a poultice from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another way to make a poultice, administered for the restoration of a broken bone; and when you wish to resolve any remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe: take the root of aloe, and camomile, and the flowers of violet, and the flour of herb, each in equal parts; grind all into a fine powder, and mix with wine, unless the limb is already warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is already warmed, then mix that with the moist water of coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another way to make a poultice that is stronger than the first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the root of hawthorn and the seed of flax and balm and melilot and sassafras and violet flowers and chamomile, all equal parts. Grind everything together, and make a mixture with water of willow or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	Use the entire thing according to the heat of the member and the quieting of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	But Hippocrates did not say in his book that something should be put on a fractured member during its restoration, unless it is made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he said that it should be the middle between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen's opinion is that things should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration which have cooling properties of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense, and similar substances to those we mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of making a plaster that relieves injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe of equal parts of mugwort, and cypress, and human hair clippings, or bird's feather, and hawthorn, and salt. Grind them together, sift them, and make a plaster out of it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But the quantity should be according to how much is needed so that the bandage remains, and then it is dissolved. Consider this: if the patient does not experience pain, or pruritus, or the fractured bone is not moved from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if it happens that a severe itching occurs, or troubling pain, or inflammation; then hasten and dissolve it within an hour, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth, or a marine sponge, and wet it; and submerge it in warm water, and wash with it the place until the itching ceases and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a piece of cut linen over it, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose-colored oil: and bind it there for one night, until you are secure from hot abscesses, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then go back to a thin stricture and apply a small plaster: and do not tighten it with your first constriction and subtlety, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	But if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the accidents are now completely gone, and you still need a plaster and stricture, then go back to doing what you did at first evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	But if none of those things happen to the member that we mentioned, then you should not release it until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released twenty days later, entirely as appears to you from the dissolution of the member, just as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh grows over it: add also then in stricture more than your first constriction altogether: and add also in the nourishment of an infirm person, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the location of the fracture already drying out and wasting away more than it should: then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore bathe it with warm water all around as you dissolve it, and let it be so for three days, and a little loosen the stricture.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment reaches the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But what the foolish restorers do to a fractured member is different from how it should be restored, and instead they restore it by twisting, which is an error of their operation and great fear: and if they were right, they would have said so in their old books, and acted with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen anywhere their signs in that at all, and it is better, that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an accident on the head.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fracture are diverse, and its figures many; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is the one that occurs by percussion with an axe: and percussion takes away the bone entirely until it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axle does in wood: and on account of this, this species of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the axe falls upon something of a bone, and cuts its face, and the cut does not penetrate to the end of it: and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Lateral absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is the one that is crushing or grinding: and its cause is percussion with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either piercing, which is already approaching the membrane, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the face of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures, either small or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture is the one that is hidden in the bone in subtlety of hair: and it is a small crack, and on account of this, this species of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture that occurs by falling or percussion with a stone, and similar things, which cause the bone plate to move inward and creates a hollow: just as happens in a cauldron when there is percussion, and part of it moves inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed most often this occurs in the heads of humid bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these species of fractures are separate and I will come with the recollection of that whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fracture by observation over them and inquiry with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh which is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species indeed of Capillary fracture is known by this, that it appears above the bone, and is wiped away, and covered with a poultice: for the fracture itself appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of the fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient: then if you see from the accidents a sign manifestly indicating fear, such as vomiting of choler, and sweating, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncopes, and acute fever, and evacuations of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these, arising from accidents in many dispositions, by no means is it cured: and if you do not see threatening accidents, and hope for salvation: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is this, if he comes to you wounded at first when it wounds him: and it occurs on winter days, then you must strive in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it occurs on summer days, then you must strive to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is beneath the bone from pus corrupts and those accidents which we narrated occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached pus touching the brain, and it is with minute cracks and attractions: then you must cut off the broken and worn-out part, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded person: and wash over the bone in whatever way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy on the sick person.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you during the detection of bone a flow of blood or a warm abscess: then apply to him what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil; and make the wound quiet until the swelling subsides, and be sure of no bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one or two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is to cut the bone with a narrow and sharp saw: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another Incisorium, after the first one, slightly broader: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply also another Incisorium, even broader than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have with you a number of different saws: some of which are broader than others, and some of which are shorter than others; and they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made of iron or wood; and use ease in striking on the saw, so as not to shake the head or hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and tough: then you must first pierce around it with Terebras that are not deep-cutting; and they are not so called unless because they do not penetrate to the end of the bony part beyond it, because the edge of the Terebra is rounded above what is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take a large number of these Terebras, each one suitable for the thickness of the bone, until the present situation is such that there is a Terebra for every part of the skull: and the length and shortness of its sharp edge should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of Terebras or Trepanums.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around a fractured bone is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the drill to another place and position it so that what is between every hole and the thickness of a radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is between every hole in the bone; and make it finer than you can on the edge of slightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, or by hand, or with some other instrument that you prepared for this, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to beware of all caution, lest the drill or incisors touch anything from the splint.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have circumnavigated the bone by piercing and it has been separated from the splint, if it was continuous with it, and you have removed it, it is necessary that you smooth and equalize the extremity of what remains in the bone with another similar instrument, an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thin and fine rather than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If something remains of small bones and is loose, then take it with ease with the tool that you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with linen cloths and ointments which we mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is easy, truly remote from fear, which Galen said and praised with great praise: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin uncovering the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular incisor, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part is not cutting anything smooth: and the sharp part of it goes along its two sides in length, as you see: so that the lenticular part is resting on the splint, with its cut side facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the upper incisor on one side with a small mallet, until you cut through the entire bone with ease, as it yields: and be secure with a cloth, lest something unexpected happen that you would utterly fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men and more ignorant of his art, nor asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from a cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the end of the incisor's handle and free it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed by him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and subtle ridges: then it is necessary that you file away this roughness and remove those ridges with fine rasps which you prepared for various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to apply these in every place more suitable and correct, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you apply them in proportion to your own measure, as first you file the bone more widely with those fine rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a still finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you come to administering more finely and subtly than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each remaining small crack or fracture of the hair-like threads, and in a subtle break, it is necessary to apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not hidden from anyone, to whom any study is devoted in this art, and stands over what we have written, and has been shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the cloth is detected and retained when you are removing the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it as easily as you can on top of that, so it does not become tight.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the wide bandage on top of it: and do not tighten it unless by the amount that holds the wound just so: and leave it for one day or two days, until you are certain about the absence of suppurative heat.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and apply remedies after that which remove excessive dryness: such as lily roots, plantain flour, and powdered thuris, and aristolochia, and similar things to these: and it is, so you make a powder from these remedies which is powdered over the wound like the dried ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply all medicine to it that has a property to remove and not corrode.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your power, so that the wound is clear in your treatment: nor should it be in that dirty with ointment, nor befouled.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow pus to gather there entirely: for when pus gathers on the linen cloth of the brain, it corrupts it and putsrefies it, and a great evil befalls the sick person after that; and indeed it often happens in the head wound, when the mouth is cleared from it, especially when its care is neglected, a blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	So then consider, if accidents happen to the sick person which we mentioned, know that it is certainly deadly.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then you must take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and linen threads with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the wound: afterwards, take care of it with remedies that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that only two parts of the nose above are broken simultaneously, or one of them, because it has two bones. Since what is below is cartilaginous, it does not break and only suffers from abrasion, twisting, and bending.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nasal opening and use your index finger and thumb to realign that fracture until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with skill and ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that no severe pain occurs due to your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then you should use the end of a radius bone with a small knob.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same for each one and strive to achieve restoration of its natural shape on the first day possible after the fracture.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then seven or ten days later, in a state of calm and free from suppuration.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a linen cloth at the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two cloths if the fracture is in both parts, and let the thickness of the cloth be such that it fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers said that linen cloths should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But that does not seem right to me; rather, it is fitting to soak the linen cloth in egg white mixed with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let the linen cloth be left until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes stiff.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of the linen cloth, after it has been wrapped in a soft cloth; and this causes the fracture to be held more firmly, so that an invalid may not be hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, sew with linen.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If an abscess should happen to occur on the nose again while you are operating, apply poultices to the nose with cerate, or with a poultice infused in rose oil, or a small one from diaquylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if no abscess occurs, then it is necessary to bind it with poultices made of sesame flour and the powder of burnt frankincense mixed with white of egg.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a piece of smooth cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to split them open and remove them with instruments that fit.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then bind the wound with a dressing and care for it with what closes and consolidates, using suitable poultices or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	That if a wound should occur between the nose, then it is necessary to care for it with linen cloths and administer a leaden cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Of the restoration of the lower jawbone when it becomes disjointed.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jawbone becomes disjointed and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if it is fractured only on the outside and does not split into two parts and curve towards the inside: then recognition of this is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jawbone, you should insert your left index finger into the injured bone: similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the prominence of the fracture towards the outside with ease, using your other hand from the inside part of the bone.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	That if the fracture of the jawbone has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply extension from both sides, according to straightness: until it becomes possible for them to be equal.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however a commotion or disruption has already occurred in the teeth: then bind them with those that remain using a gold thread, or silver thread, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a cauter above the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place above it a doubled cloth, and place above the cloth a large plaster, well-made, or a piece of equal-sized sole leather, along the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to the preparation of its binding and its application suits, until it is not destroyed; and command the patient to use tranquility and quietness: and place their food in gentle sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something is changing its shape in some way: then hurry and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been altered from that and apply a poultice to it with barley flour, or with sheep's milk, after you have removed the cauter; and place wool on top of the poultice.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore that poultice remains attached to it and the bone arrangement does not change, release it, so as not to break it, until it is healed; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For indeed this fracture is bound many times over a period of three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times to calm it down, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, take note.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Namely if the bone fragment or splinter is already separated from the bone: then take care of this carefully, so that you remove those fragments along with what suits you for their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the wound opening is tight, then widen it with a lancet according to the amount of need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, or if the wound opening is large: and if not, place above it one of the plasters that fit for this and flesh out the wound until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	About the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed the clavicle is often broken from the anterior part near the shoulder and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or indeed it is broken and separated into two parts, except that there are complications involved, and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or indeed it is broken in such a way that the complications occur in the bone, and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or indeed it is broken with an open wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when there is no wound is to have two attendants, one of whom should hold support as follows after the fractured clavicle and the other stretch the neck towards that side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then straighten out the fracture with your fingers until its shape is restored, as it should be, and that there be no prominence or concavity.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	And if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a ball of cloth or wool under the weak person's titillic and make its size according to the quantity of your necessity: and extend and elevate the clavicle and tighten the ball with your hand until the fracture is equal, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	And if you are not able to pull the end of the clavicle to the outside because it has gone too deep: then it is necessary for the weak person to be raised up onto their own chest and you should place a pillow medium-sized under their shoulder, and have your attendant press down on their shoulder towards the lower part until the bone of the clavicle that is in the deep part is lifted up to the top: and then straighten out the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel a sathaium coming out of the clavicle and it moves: then it is necessary to apply pressure above it and extract the sathaium with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use your skills in cutting it with one of the instruments that you prepared for this purpose, after you have placed under the furrow an instrument that saves the flesh: and it is an instrument made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is similar to a snail shell which has no hollowing out.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need for it from the size of the bone and its flatness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the disruption of the wound that you made when you extracted the splintered bone is wide, and you have secured it from putridity by applying heat: then gather together the two edges of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear putridity: then fill the wound with linen and cotton according to the size of the wound's incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	And if putridity occurs, then pour linen soaked in rose oil, vinegar, and wine over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	And the binding of the bone when it is without a wound and without cutting is, as you put a plaster made from milling flour with egg white over the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft cloth on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under the tilt of it, if you need to.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hametah, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and its width be about the length of one's hand or roughly that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cotton cloth over the cloth and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a needle from a fine board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with a little bit of thread around the fracture and the spot where the bone falls.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bone above the fracture as it has been turned back, and wrap it around his neck and under the titillium of both the sound and the unsound parts: and bring it over all the parts, and as you see that the binding holds the fracture tightly bound: and this is what is not hidden from you, and all, so that the thread does not move away from the fractured bone above.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary to look at the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever then the binding loosens and you see the thread is already moving away: then correct it and tighten the binding.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's pillow behind his back, and place a small pillow under the titillium of both sides during sleep, so that when he sleeps, aid may come to him from his own side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the wing is therefore lifted up through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens in the place that is inflamed from itching or abscess, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the binding, and let him go, until he is restored and has healed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the wing is bound and comforted according to many, in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the Spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula is rarely broken and it breaks far from its edge: and the edges of it are not usually broken.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When then the break is in that place and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then prepare for it according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And bring it back to its natural shape in whatever way your ingenuity makes possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place powdered linen with white of egg, and gentle poultice, and place a small piece of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place a wide plate made from thin board over it, according to the size of the spatula as a whole, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is a hollow under the plate in some part of the spatula, then equalize it with a gentle poultice, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it with a linen cloth that is long and smooth, by gentle constriction and firmness of the plate, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage becomes loosened, tighten it and adjust the plate if it has moved from its place, and let the invalid lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not to be feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment of bone proceeds and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said regarding a fracture of the clavicle from cauterizing an apostema hot, if something happens as a result.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of a fracture of the chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in its middle part, and it rarely occurs.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are broken and shattered by accidents that befall it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which bends downwards and causes a severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and the concavity of the fractured bone is revealed, and does not remain hidden from sense, its restoration is that the invalid be raised up on his back: and place between the spatulas a poultice.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs from both sides with your hands: and make fine adjustments in proportion to him, according as it is possible and fitting, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a poultice and plaster over him, and place a splint made from willow or hazel wood, or something similar, on top of it, after you have wrapped him in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then fine-tune the binding over the fractured bone so that it does not move; and go with the bandage according to the curvature to the back a few times, and tighten it in a decent manner.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if necessity demands to dissolve it due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and dissolve it, and remove the poultice, and correct what happens according to the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the poultice if you see it is needed; and attach a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ On the restoration of Ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Caput IX. (meaning "Chapter 9")
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a rib fracture does not occur except in thick places which follow the back and from the ends of those ribs on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they are not worn away except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from sensation during an examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that you equalize the fracture with your fingers in a possible manner until the figure becomes equal as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply poultices and bind the broken bone with splints if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is inclined towards the interior: then it causes the patient severe pain and puncture, just like the puncture that occurs in one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood happens to him many times: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have been skilled in this with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should place foods for the sick person which will generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly may be inflamed, and stretch out, and propel a fracture to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however shun it, so that no quick cause may lead to making a warm abscess, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then we add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let something be placed over the swollen area, then it should be sucked with strength, and it is similar to a reason.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the swelling will attract superfluities to the place due to the condition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary to cover the place with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil: and put small pieces of linen between the ribs, until it is filled: so that the binding may be equal when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the sick person be cured by the treatment of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	What if the vital force is oppressive to the sick person, which they cannot tolerate, and the mouth is pierced by puncture or wound, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we open up over the place, and uncover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put above it the instrument that preserves the suture, whose description preceded: and let us cut open the mouth with ease, and cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us care for it with poultices, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	What if a warm abscess happens meanwhile, then hurry and pour poultices into rose oil, and place them over the place: and let the sick person be cured with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile it will be spread over the side where he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a broken vertebra of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, fractures of the vertebrae of the neck sometimes occur, and rarely does attrition happen to them; similarly with the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So when this happens to someone, and you want to know whether they will recover or not: then you should consult.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already relaxed, stunned, and lifeless; and he is unable to move them, or straighten them, or contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor feels any pain in them: then you will know that he is not recovering, and in many cases this is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels constriction with your fingers and pricking: then you will know that the vertebra of the bone is safe, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if a similar thing happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether he will recover or not: then consider his feet. Then if you see that they are relaxed, and what happens in them is the same as what happens in his hands; and when he lies on his back, flatulence and evacuation occur without his will; and when he is raised up over his belly, evacuation occurs without his will; and when he is raised up over his back, and he wants to urinate, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	So do not bother with treating him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing like that happens to him, the case is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of him who suffers from that is to apply a cooling plaster to the apostematized vertebra; so that you put rose oil or lard on it, alone.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it on top of it several times a day until the apostema becomes cool; then place one of the comforting, drying, and binding plasters over the spot, and bind it with a bandage. And instruct the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens that a bone is broken or something has separated from it: then you must make an incision on the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather two flaps of the wound together, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment from unguents until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last bone of the backbone is fractured and it is the end of the tail: then you must put your left hand into the anus and with your right hand align the broken bone as much as possible, and with a second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something on top of it and remove it; and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The Restoration of Anches.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the Anches are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	For if they are broken, then the break of theirs is not, except for comminution at their extremities; and they split along their length and bend inwardly towards the interior; and it happens to the patient that there is pain in the place, and a puncture: and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration indeed is, that you stretch out your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as its shape is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	For if the fracture is only at its extremities, then align it with the fracture, according to how it is prepared for you from alignment, until it becomes like its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however a fracture is in length, or already inclines towards the interior: then make the patient lie on their belly until you prepare for them the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you equalize it, place a poultice on top of it: then place a splint made from wood or skin on top of it: and bind tightly above so that you do not fear the fracture's permutation, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the hollow with him as it fills her, until it is held tight by a binding according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however a warm abscess should happen to him: then cease from stretching it and its restoration, until the warm abscess subsides: and place on top of it what settles on top of it, as previously, and then return to restoring it: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens that bone splinters or is crushed, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the Restoration of a Fracture Assisting.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Assistant is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Saw.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one or two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a piece of flat wood of middle thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And it is bound at both ends with two straps.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it will be suspended from a raised place, and the patient will sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he will throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the notch of its own, where a curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that the assistant may stretch it down below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor will equalize the fracture with his own hands simultaneously, until the fracture returns to its proper state.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is, that the patient be placed on his own chest; and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants to have one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and have the other hold below it and stretch out each of them to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament; and have each of the two assistants stretch out to their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the shoulder extremity, then it is necessary to place one ligament under the deltoid and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to place a ligament above that spot and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equal the fracture with ease and without labor, until the fracture is equal as it should be, and a good setting is applied: then bind it, unless a hot aposteme occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot aposteme occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place a compress made of linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil on top of it until the aposteme subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding is to put an poultice over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an inunction of new cloth on top of the poultice.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bring the arm over to support it, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and bind it over the supporting arm, so that the arm stands in its stellar position: if nothing prevents you from doing so, nor is anything altered on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	What if you fear that something from the broken bone will be altered on you, then use stars: and it is to place a star over the fracture itself which is wider and stronger than other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And you will place between every stellar width of a finger; and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all parts.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie tightly over the stars the constriction which I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your constriction should be tighter over the site of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture elongates, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	So if you see the position of the stars and the constriction as we said, in the hour that you restore the member immediately, then do so; and if you fear a warm abscess, then release the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the ligament in all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, or food is prevented from reaching the member, due to the excess constriction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct that entire thing according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are very confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligament unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the invalid's sleep be over his back, and his hand over his stomach; and place under his support a full pillow of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And examine at every hour of the night or day, lest the shape of the broken member is not restored, or the ligament becomes relaxed.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that entire thing with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the invalid according to the order which we have prescribed, so that it may be a subtle diet at first, until his mouth begins to feel inclined; then it is necessary for you to increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of the aid and foot is, that it should be tightened for forty days; then therefore it is necessary to release it, and to administer a bath, and to treat with ointments which correct that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, wear it out: then do not release from it a ligament and small bones until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the Restoration of a Fractured Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is great, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater humerus alone is broken, or the smaller one: and perhaps they are both broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small upper humerus is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse it is, when both bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is broken is the small upper humerus, then it is fitting for a doctor to apply in its restoration a small extension with ease, until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the greater humerus is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to apply a strong and very tight splint.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the shape of a hand in its restoration, and its extended extension above the elbow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher above all the fingers; and let the wrist joint be below all the fingers, or the rest: and let the patient sit square on themselves, and let the elbow be before him, or directly opposite to it, in height, so that the patient does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then have the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either by hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant extend similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor straightens the bone until it reduces to its better shape as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in a bone fracture, then try to reduce every fragment into its place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a separated splinter appears and causes a wound, and you have no hope of restoring it; then find something to cover it over, and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if there is a fracture with a wound, I have already treated that separately, so take the cure for it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if suppuration occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then tie a cloth made from rose oil, white wax, and a mixture with a consistency between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth tightly over it with a subtle string until the suppuration subsides: then remove the cerate and apply a prepared poultice made from miller's dust and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place plasters, and let the plaster placed over the fracture be a bit wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of plasters on an arm is six in many arrangements: whether there is a fracture in one or two places at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the fractured area stronger and more tightly, and a bit more so towards the upper or lower part of the fracture: or put a milder bandage on top of it for a little while, according to what was mentioned earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist ones: and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread used for binding be made from pure linen, with a consistency between thin and thick, as we mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the member and its ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	But if something occurs that requires correction, such as itching which happens to the member: then it is necessary to anoint the member with warm water until the itching subsides, and do not bind the member tightly until the itching subsides; then reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture is already softened, and the bone is removed, and similar things: then correct that whole thing with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive stricture, then it is necessary for you to soften it slightly and leave it for a few days until it reaches the nourishment, and then bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of what we said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary for you to release it unless after twenty days or approximately those.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand should be suspended from their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be steady, and be guarded by his own power against any movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days, and possibly even in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	That whole thing is according to the dispositions of temperaments and the dispositions of power.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	About the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture rarely occurs in the palmar aponeurosis and joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen unless there is much wear and tear.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or wear and tear occurs in the palm, then it is necessary for the patient to sit square, and before him should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on top of that one, stretched out.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant should extend the broken bones and the doctor should set them straight until they are joined together with good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a poultice and plaster, unless there occurs a hot swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however a fracture is near the lower part of the foot around the belly of the plantar region, then make something like a sphere out of cloth: and order the patient to bend down over it with their fractured foot: afterwards be tied with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let it be a pad made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the foot of the body: and bind it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is to the exterior, then it is necessary: that you place a pad above, and another pad below on the foot: and let your hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the bandage as your hand is bent: and stretch between the fingers with a strap.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if there occurs a fracture of any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it will be set straight as needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind with the foot: and if necessary, place a small straight pad on it, so that the fracture may rise up and not be moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, ring, or little finger, then it will be set straight and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all of them will be bound according to their continuity: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small pad on top of it, as we said about the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration and after the aforesaid disposition of warm poultices: and apply with it what is necessary when something happens from that, according to how its narration goes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	§ On the Restoration of Fractures of the Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and declared to the sense: because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that a bandage is wrapped above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should be placed on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the surgeon should stretch all his ligaments towards his own side according to equality; and this is done when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be placed on the side of the groin, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture near the knee, then let one ligament be placed near the knee, so that the extension falls towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should equalize the bone with his two hands, until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape; and the bone is joined together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you place a poultice and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess does occur in it: then let it remain for several days, until the abscess cools down; and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And the bandage should be tied thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap something hard and firm over the fracture, namely a bandage: and double it twice, or thrice: and let the excess remain.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the foot.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap it back over the leg and hip, with what remains of the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip above the fracture small stones, and place one stone above the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage may be equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle above the place of the fracture, in three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you stretch with the ligament from the place of fracture, your stricture will be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then direct it to both ends of the bandage, that you have inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind therefore with each of the three small stones which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with both ends of the bandage to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both, bind also the ends of the small stones from the other side: so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the stricture above that, while it remains, so that no damage occurs to the member, nor swelling, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	What if something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore hasten with its resolution and correct what happens afterwards, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however there is a fragment of bone that hurts: then it is necessary to equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find something above it and remove it: and care for the one whose previous mention preceded, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides which small stones are added to it, as we said in aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration when thus broken, no lameness occurs to the one who is weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides which another leg is applied to him, then it is necessary that he who has it will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little added to, or a little diminished from, all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	About the restoration of a broken kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Here is the translation:
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture of the kneecap is rare, but attrition occurs frequently to it.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If a fracture does occur to it, then only by a fissure or an opening can its parts be split.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And that is both with wound and without wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is set above it entirely with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers will be equalized until it is gathered and joined according to what is possible in equality and ease and art.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a poultice made from sesame flour or miller's flour with egg white on it; and place above it a round splint, if you need it; and bind it securely with a suitable bandage over it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have narrated regarding other fractures: such as applying warm poultices and similar ones; so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Of the Restoration of a Fracture of the Leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called by the name "Cruris," and the other is thin and is called "Femur.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them according to the forms of fracture which occurs in two arm bones; and because of this, its restoration is done equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If the two bones are broken at the same time, the leg turns into a mass in all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg turns towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below; and it is one of those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply extension, equality, and binding with splints according to what is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However it is necessary, if there is a foul fracture of the leg, having many sutures: so that the extension be less and the alleviation of your treatment.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from an operation above the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the splints, and complete all your operation, then take two pieces of pine wood, which is used in the manufacture of tables, which are placed under benches: and they are made from palm-shaped spatulas: and choose from them those whose thickness is small, nor are they minute; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downward.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each piece around with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side, and another from the other side: and let them be from the knee to the lower part of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two pieces together in three places at both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when a stricture is prevented, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed a cradle should be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and placed in it, so that the leg may be preserved from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And very much indeed it is necessary to do this when there is a wound properly with the fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day and strive with it with utmost study against suppuration, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something of those happens, then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a complete fracture does not occur in the calcaneus.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes experience fracture, and also the fingers experience a little fracture: and it does not happen to them unless by attrition in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones elevated above themselves, then the invalid should place his foot on prepared ground as one walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on what is raised from those bones; afterwards, press or trample it: and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a poultice and a bandage on top; and place a small flat board under the foot, with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it to the foot with a binding that is fitting, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days pass for him, then loosen the binding.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them as I have narrated to you for the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint under your finger according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider; afterwards, place this board under the foot as I have narrated to you, and bind it with a binding that is fitting.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is from two or three or more bones, then place a splint over the entire finger of its own size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower part of the foot; and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, in order to hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you to remember, and not forget, but rather consider all that I have told you about other fractures from the accidents we mentioned; and oppose each accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Of the fracture of a woman's womb, and the bone of her pelvis, and the man's spine.
Caput XIX.	Here is the translation:
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the side of her own back for a little while, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill up her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let it be in the vulva as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be shaken, and her back lifted gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton will come out when it becomes like a sphere before the entrance of the vulva, and the broken opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease, then let her urinate; and return it according to the manner in which you first inserted it: then let it return to its original poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days or about, for the opening is being restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie it over the hole with a reed tube, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it will be filled with cotton, and remain for a few days, as we have narrated, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the opening of the scrotum of a man or woman is broken, then apply what we have narrated for the restoration and equalization of that which was said about bone anchors.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures which touch only slightly, especially for someone with a certain study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book thoroughly, because the fracture itself signifies to you many ways of straight paths in restoring and constraining its own. Therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	In the phallus of a man when it is broken, take a goose's gizzard and insert it into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrapping of cloth over it and wrap it up. Let it be for three days or nearly so, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for someone who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if it is a major one such as the hip bone or some other similar area, to bleed immediately and then proceed to apply the remedies we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound flows with blood, then you should hasten to apply a poultice to it, crushing powdered verdigris over the top of it; or, if that is not available, then use something else.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a warm abscess occurs, then put off the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad accidents to occur.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the fractured bone is prominent and visible above the skin: then it is necessary that you gently bring it back into place with your hands, equalizing it with a small amount of ease and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if there is no preparation for its extension or equalization by your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is one made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingerbreadths, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason it is necessary for a doctor to take from them three or four, according to the size which is needed for its cure, in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round; and let it have a small thickness so that it is not doubled upon itself under pressure during the operation; and let its sharp extremity have a rim at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above him to the thickness from the middle of him up to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the acute and curved end of it be placed over the projecting bone; and push it with him together, until the bone returns and becomes equal by some measure.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Then therefore make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the ends of it are broken and fine, and do not receive it with good reception, then it is necessary to cut off that end of the bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you are not able to reduce them as we described completely, then cut it off with the saws that suit it from the ones we mentioned: or saw it through with a saw in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then afterwards remove what remains on the bone from roughness and small fragments of bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and the invalid finds a severe and painful pain after the reduction of it, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Make it so.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you are doing a great benefit to the invalid when your restoration is completed which you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black wine that is stiptic.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a cautery or anything containing oil on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption to occur within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer honey in the hour that completes your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered: thus, you will cut with forceps a hole in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware of every caution, lest you sew up the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times indeed foolish doctors have done this: and they have brought harm to their sick patients, or death, or putrefaction, or gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from the other constrictions of broken bones.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad or a great one, and you fear certain evil consequences that we have mentioned, and you find pain suspended in the place: then it is not right to apply poultices to it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them swellings from hard cloths in the place of poultices, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth that you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer lycium and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, as the four-pharmaceutical ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows from it to lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	Which if many days pass over the wound and it does not consolidate nor is pus cut away from it: then you will know that there are small bone splinters inside.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	As many of those bone splinters are separated, remove them and take out the others.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And as for those that are not separated and pierce the member, causing pain and making it suffer, try to cut them away and remove them in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	Which if it happens to the wound to become gangrenous, or ecchymotic, that is, putrid, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each one of them what suits it for its treatment, as was narrated in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And as for that which is necessary so that my speech stands firm, and to whom you should present your mind when a bone breaks out and protrudes above the limb, just like the hip bone, and similar ones from major bones, it is, do not presume its attraction, for many times death occurs because of this, indeed let it be, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall by itself after twenty days or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore take care of the wound if you think fit; and if not, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	About the treatment of a knot (or swelling) in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often occurs in the track of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near joints: and it is corrupted from the figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Then consider, if the knot is recent: apply medicines to it that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the knot in a poultice, and bind them tightly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And let the stricture be, nor loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it and repeat another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a lead plate decently.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the knot has already become hardened into a stone, and is tightly fixed, and necessity presses urgently to remove it: then find above it on its upper part, and cut off the projecting excess: or shave it with certain rasps, until it is removed: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Of the healing when it is restored and the member remains after that subtle, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	(No text provided, just a title!)
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the bone fracture is restored and the member remains after that subtle and weak, then it does not become sound unless many causes intervene.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the multitude of ligament solution and binding not according to what is necessary; or because of the excess constriction of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from reaching the member; or because of excessive embrocation at an unsuitable time; or because of a lack of blood in the weak body and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure for that is to feed the sick person and make their body tender until the blood is multiplied within them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the member, so that it may draw the pitch to itself and receive much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And frequently apply an embrocation of it with warm water, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Of the healing of bones fractured when they are restored in a twisted manner.
Caput XXIII.	(No text provided, just a title!)
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens to a member that has already been restored after its healing and becomes twisted, or the bone is fractured, or swelled up; and is marred in this way by the form of the member, although the member is not prevented from performing its natural function: then one should not take heed of his speech who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already many foolish doctors and restorers have done this on our earth.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, so that it becomes mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to apply an embrocation with warm water in which soothing herbs have been decocted, such as the leaves of althea, its root, and melilotus, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a poultice shall be made for him with a soothing poultice, as a diaper well-made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or the pulp of the tall-root shall be taken and pounded with hen's fat or sesame oil, and applied with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or they shall take figs that are fat, and pound them with dove's down, and similar things which are called from medicines diminishing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the swelling is dissolved by frequent gentle friction with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And motion of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already occurred and has become severe and has turned into a knot, and necessity demands its correction with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to break the continuity of the bone, and to remove what exceeds from the swelling or bone with fine instruments; and facilitation should be administered in that place with solicitude and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 28.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prevented by its own motion, and the figure of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes great pains and injuries to happen to the weak person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: lest it be utterly delayed.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will suppurate, and perhaps with that, the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore one should not move or stretch it at the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then one should hasten to bleed the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be given a rest until the suppuration subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the member be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every member should be treated with that which its memory will come to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocations, and also according to what preceded on fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Two jawbones are hardly dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places with a small removal and are made soft for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a complete and full dislocation until they become soft up to the chest, until the patient's saliva flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped around his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is small, then it returns to its natural state with a few movements by itself.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete and full, then it is necessary that reduction be administered quickly and not delayed at all: and it is for the minister to hold the patient's head; and the doctor should insert his thumb into the root of the dislocated jawbone between the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both thumbs simultaneously if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, with which he can apply pressure.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And order the patient to clean their jawbones and prepare them for eating in all directions.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should apply pressure to the jawbone and push it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jawbones are simultaneous: then administer a poultice with warm water and oil until the easy reduction of both is accomplished: nor should you delay the reduction of both entirely, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are equalized, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they do not soften: then place over them wool pads with a mixture made from wax, and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it will be bound with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient's sleep be above their back; and their head be placed between two pillows, so that they do not move to the right or left: nor should they attempt, nor be forced, to chew anything: rather, their food should be given by spoon, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is relaxed: then let them eat what they want, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not exert themselves over their own mouth's operation during eating and drinking, and also during yawning, until the jaw is relaxed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two jawbones becomes difficult when they are dislocated for some time and do not turn back to their places: then often fevers occur, and constant headaches; and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see that: then you will know that it is a loss, and often he who experiences that dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocations of the Clavicle and End of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The clavicle indeed does not become dislocated from the inward side, due to its continuity with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it becomes dislocated sometimes to the outside and is declared by feeling.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is when the patient lies on their back and stretches out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with your palm in strong compression, for it will return of itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a poultice and wool pads over it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of his which follow the elbow and continue with it are not dislocated unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	When he is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that he be reduced and set right according to what we said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a poultice and bandage over it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the shoulder extremity is reduced when it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Of the reduction of the dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder does not become dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it becomes dislocated towards the lower part of the scapula.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it becomes dislocated towards the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it becomes dislocated towards the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated towards the back due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated towards the front due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it becomes dislocated and comes out towards the lower part of the scapula, especially in those whose flesh is meager.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes out quickly from them and goes back in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those however whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it goes out with difficulty and comes back in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people that they are struck or fall, and the shoulder becomes inflamed with a warm abscess, and is considered to be because it has already become dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you must try that until you are certain of it, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known as a dislocation when it turns towards the lower parts in a tilting manner. And distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a sound one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a manifest difference between them, and you will find a concavity on the head of the shoulder, and under the tilting part at the touch of the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg: and an infirm person is not able to reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the breast or upwards: then you will find a manifest touch, nor does it hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this kind of dislocation is easily reducible when it is recent or the patient is an infant.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is by lifting your hand up above.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your fingers underneath the tilting part of it, and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place. And the minister will lift his hand and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it back down, for it returns quickly on its own.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return as we said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary for the infirm person to bathe in warm water, and a poultice should be applied that softens and soothes, just as if roots of elder, foenugreek, and mellilot were being decocted in water, and it should be applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the infirm person should be placed on his back: and a ball and wool should be placed underneath the tilting part of it, which is equal to both softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel on top of the ball and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and draw the infirm person's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the head of the infirm person so that it does not move downwards: for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you make the present man who is longer than the patient, stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the armpit of the patient; and lift up the armpit of the patient to the higher parts, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another assistant pull the hand of the patient down to his lower abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the patient is light: then it is necessary to suspend something else with him, so that he may be weighted down: for the dislocation will return immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another method: and it is, that a long piece of wood be placed on the ground, whose head is rounded in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar, which is not too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a soft cloth should be placed under the patient after soft cloths have been put on his head, and the patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be stretched out to the lower part on one side, and his body should be extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers: which has a rounded head, so that its entrance may be eased into the depth of the armpit, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be wrapped around the rounded head, so that it may not hurt the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the armpit of the patient, so that his hand or arm may be extended up to the lower part over the wood; and the wood should be tied above the assistant's help and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed over the step of the stairs in width, and the hand should be extended down, and the rest of the body should be let go suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture indeed enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	So when the entrance is completed in whatever way possible: then it is necessary to place under the titillium a ball of wool of equal size.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared poultice made from mill dust with frankincense and egg white on top of the shoulder, as it is wrapped over.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind the string under the titillium with a tight knot that is fitting; and let the ligament be wrapped over the poultice above: and let his hand be attached to her neck, and let it be left undisturbed for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place a light diet upon the weak person until the limb is comforted; for it is more helpful for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one should be placed after seven days or five, and exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is strengthened and not softened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the suture is dislocated many times, due to moisture that happens to it, or due to another cause: then it is necessary to apply a cautery with three openings, according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if this is done and the ligament is released after seven days and the suture does not hold firm, and the poultice and bandage are reapplied several times and still do not hold, and it falls and cannot be lifted to its higher position: then you will know that the nerves of his shoulder which are related to the head have already been cut or stretched or softened: and you will know that the suture will never take hold in its proper place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast, or towards the back, happens with a push and stretching with one's hands: until it returns and a remaining bandage and care are administered, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If it happens after healing that heaviness occurs in a member and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use a bath many times until this heaviness is alleviated and returns to their natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Of the cure of cubital dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns to its place with difficulty as well; and indeed it dislocates towards all parts, and particularly towards either the front or the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever shape it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you bring together the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is made clear to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs, it makes the reduction difficult: and perhaps it will not be cured at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and more violent in its pain; and often descends with it to death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is one of those that can be reduced is, that his hand should be stretched out with two hands: and his arm should be expanded, and the doctor's hands should be above the elbow and below it, and he should push the joint with the tips of his fingers or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns in such a way that he doubles his hand with his own, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply a violent and strong stretching: and it is, that two assistants should stretch out his arm: and they should also hold him so that he is not moved during the stretching.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned towards every part after it is wrapped around his hand with a doubled cloth, or a wide band.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he should anoint it with oil, so that it may be one of those things which aid in the ease and facility of the joint.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction, it is necessary that a poultice be placed over it, which has purging and cooling properties with white of egg: and it should be bound tightly with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the invalid, and let it rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint is stable in its place, then release the bandage from it and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then apply a poultice, and bandage, and let it rest for several days until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if heaviness occurs to the joint after the reduction, and it is in motion: then administer a moistening treatment by bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relaxed, or place a poultice of fat goat's milk over the joint.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and let it rest on it by day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he sweats, then stroke the joint with a tempered friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply over it an ointment of aloe, one way, and secondly, and thirdly, with the entering into the bath, until it is relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it warm cow dung, moist and heated with butter, and bind over him.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	This is itself soothed and returns to its natural condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of a dislocation in the shoulder.
Caput XXIX.	Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The shoulder of Mahassem is frequently dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, it is not so with other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed of reducing his dislocation be in the hour when it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed: or a hot abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of his dislocation is, to place Mahassem's weak hand on a table, and have the attendant extend it; and the doctor should put his own palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider whether the palm has already receded towards the front of the hand; then the weak person should place the back of their hand on the table for extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inward on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the table so that the doctor's hand falls on the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster over the abscess: and let him go, without repeating that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you effect a reduction after the days have passed, but the joint remains according to its own twisting: and it harms the patient nothing, except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything: then you will know that the nerves are cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is not suitable for it to be treated with an operation, except to cauterize it near its fall.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not matter.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So when Almahassem does not return, then place upon him the poultice that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound and left for five days: afterwards it should be loosened and left, and the hands should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if it is deprived of movement and something heavy happens to it; then soothe it with warm water and gentle friction a few times, until it becomes soothing.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the healing of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or from one of them towards the back of the palm or its belly; then stretch out the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and stretch it out until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night falls, bind it as previously described: and do not cease to loosen it by day; and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it is bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do the same with him if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; and bind him to that part, and perform your initial operation with him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do the same with him when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the healing of dislocation of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spine of their back or neck is fully dislocated, or many vertebrae are moved from their places; then there is no cure for this, since death hastens the invalid.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the invalid's discharge flows out without his will, nor can he restrain it; and many times certain parts of his body become soft, or one of his legs, or one of his arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times it is removed because many times it is removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed towards the back, is called Humpiness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of it is that you consider then if Humpiness happens from childhood: then there is no cure in it nor any healing whatsoever.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens by chance or striking or similar things, the old methods of treatment have already been described at length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most do not return with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	But I have already shortened it from that which has little excuse due to its proximity to my intention: and the explanation of mine in which I explained it, and shaped the instrument differently than they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that in humpiness which occurs from the anterior part, there is no remedy nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs on the back properly, as I narrate: and it is, that the infirm person lies on his face on a level platform near the wall: and a damp cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood is placed and fixed in the hollow of the ground at the end of the platform, near his head: and another piece of wood around his feet at the other end of the platform: and the attendant holds onto the wood and stands not steady in the hollow.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other attendant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft and firm bandage around the head of the infirm person, and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is by his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and at his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them to another wood that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every assistant stretch out to the part of the wood where the ligament is, and the two woods should not be removed from their places where they are fixed; yet they should not be secured as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And let the doctor place his palms on the spondyle with strength until he returns; or place them on it on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him connect his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not recover through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' length.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make an opening in the wall of which we spoke, which is near the sick person, to where the end of the board will go.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spondyle.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well, until the spondyle is compressed, and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with a drill that is wrapped around your hand; and it is, to fix two wooden poles in the ground at the head of the sick person, one foot long each, and at his head.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length between all the wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the drill runs: and let each piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground very much, so that it will not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert a round wood: and the drill is where the ligament is twisted in two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole where the wood is secured, whose length is one palm along with what twists around: and similarly on two other woods.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you tightened in the chest of the sick person with the drill that is at his head: and the ligaments that you tightened in his legs with the drill that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let him stand by all the sawing ministers, who tightens his hand with a linen cloth, with which the saw is turned; and the surgeon adjusts the spongy thing, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the shape of the saw that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the sponge returns and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary to put on an absorbent plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place on top of the plaster a plate from wood, whose width is three fingers, or roughly that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be as long as to fit the space of the gibbousness and above the healthy part of the sponge.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it will be bound with the bandage that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should use a subtle diet until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if something remains prominent in the place at the end of the healing process: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with application of the plate which we narrated over a long period.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is administered with a lead plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that prominence occurs at the end of the back's sponge and is thought to be through it a displacement, and that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore one should not presume on him with this medicine: perhaps indeed it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	A cure for a dislocated Anca.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the Anca and the joints of the shoulder do not occur except by dislocation alone; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints due to slight removal and hollowing.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the Anca is dislocated into four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is because it is dislocated to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is dislocated very much towards the inside; and a little towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure for this dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join a sick leg with a healthy one to it, it is longer; and his knee is prominent more than that of a healthy person, and the sick person cannot double his foot at the groin; and the next place following the groin is inflamed by a hot apostema, because the head of the femur has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of it to which a dislocation occurs towards the outside is, that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of it to which a dislocation occurs towards the front is, because it stretches a healthy leg according to its complement; yet it does not double it without pain in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step forward beyond that point: and it retains urine, and the groin becomes inflamed, and during walking there is a bruising over the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of it to which a dislocation occurs towards the back is, that it does not stretch the knee, nor can it double it before doubling the groin: and its leg is also shorter on one side: and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction indeed of this kind of dislocation is, that you should consider then, whether the dislocation is old and has already become chronic with the person having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its natural disposition: then there is no cure at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	So therefore it should not be presumed of him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the one whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four kinds of dislocations: then hasten to do this, that you will loosen the joint, and stretch it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and not require another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then one should prepare a strong servant, and have him stretch his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a band that will be fastened above his knee on his leg. And let another servant stretch out his hand above, so that he may insert his hands under the patient's thighs.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him bind with a soft band over the root of the hip joint, and hold the extremity of the other band.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all their extensions be one by one, until the patient is lifted up with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common type among four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	So if the dislocation returns as we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for all four kinds of that which I shall say about proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, in the proper reduction when the dislocation is to the inside, it is necessary that the patient be raised up over his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place a band above the root of the hip joint, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place that is below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the band upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong servant take his arms and reduce the swollen part of the weak hip joint, and stretch it out to the outside with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it is returning to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind of treatment is easier for the other kinds of cure by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it does not obey you and does not enter with this kind of treatment altogether: then one should bind the two legs of the patient at the same time with a strong, soft band, over both heels, and over both knees; and let each length be as long as four finger-widths from its corresponding part: and let the weak leg be stretched out longer by an amount equal to two finger-widths.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the patient is suspended above a wooden head, which is located in the house: and its length from the ground is the measure of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct the strong youth to support the patient's head with his shoulder blade; and let another young man suspend himself along with the patient; and let the other youth push with all his might, supporting the hip joint with vigor, for the juncture returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But when the reduction is done by his own effort, and there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lies on a platform, as we have described for one with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligament be stretched over his leg, by himself, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood is placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well, on which wet cloths are wrapped so that the patient is not hurt; and let the wood be between his hips, so that he is not drawn down to the lower parts during the stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant stretches out to their side, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then it yields to reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it on the table and press it down, as we said for a humpback, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the patient's leg be stretched quickly; and it is according to this same description on a platform: and let the doctor place his right hand on the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then pull him with one hand, and with that traction place him extended to the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, and let him be raised above the ground: rather, let him be placed on a hard surface, just as it is also necessary when his ankle is dislocated outside, according to what we said about his lying on two anchors: and it is above his face and stretched ligaments: just as we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that a compression be applied with a splint also on the place where the joint will emerge, when the reduction is complete according to what is needed.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you stretch the two legs of the weak person; and when you see them equal, and the weak person tightens his leg and expands it without resistance: then you will know that the member has already returned as needed. Then join the two hips, and apply a poultice, and tie with an emplastrum, that is, a bandage: so that the groin does not move to any part; and the weak person should remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and poultice, and compare the leg with the other one; then if you see them equal in status, then you will know that the dislocation has already been stabilized. Therefore, let the weak person go to walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something softening: then go back and reapply the poultice to it, and tie it according to your initial tightening; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it slow down in walking on both sides for several days, until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and downwardly, namely, to the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of this dislocation is that you hasten the weak person to place his leg against his own hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all three forms of this dislocation is that you make the weak person sit straight, so that he already stretches his leg if he can over it, and adheres your back to his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach your face to his knee with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply both sides of his knee with your palm with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And let another assistant stretch out his foot until it returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of return is when the leg adheres to the hip with gentleness, not with difficulty.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bind him and attach the leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should not use walking for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if the return is refused to you, then apply a strong extension with bandages, of which the previous account was given in the cure of ankylosis, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Of the Cure of Dislocation of the Heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes moved slightly and sometimes dislocated according to its nature.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this dislocation is that you see the Heel inflated, proceeding to the part to which it dislocates.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the cure of this displacement is easy and simple: and it is, to stretch with ease with your hands, and equalize, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	And in the cure of this when it is displaced according to its nature, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit straight: and let a strong assistant hold him very firmly from behind at the middle part of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot like a cauls.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw his foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch with the left and push the ankle bone of the foot with the right towards the knee without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the ankle bone of the foot towards the knee on the third side and you pull back the ligament.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	So if it returns to its original position or to one of the two sides according to this method, and you see the foot is straightened, that is good; and if not, then iterate the procedure on it again, since it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if its reduction is prevented from you as we have told you: then make the patient lie on his back on the ground and place a wedge of earth firmly fixed between his thighs: and you wrap yourself around him with a cloth so that he does not hurt himself.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh: afterwards let the assistant straighten out the other foot, either with their own hands or with a bandage that ties above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all assistants stretch out against the stretching of their counterpart: and the wedge shall stand between the two thighs of the patient holding him so that his body is not drawn towards the lower parts at the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor straighten out the dislocation with his own hands and have the assistant hold the healthy leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns and its reduction is declared to you as healthy: then apply a poultice and bandage, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear of the nerves which are above the posterior heelbone, lest the bandage be too tight and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	But if the bandage becomes loose, bind him again: then release him on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he is attempting to walk before that space, there will be no security lest a dislocation occurs on top of him, and it is corrupted, and does not receive subsequent treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	What if a warm abscess should happen to him: then you must administer to him that which our previous account told of in another place for treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the Dislocation of Fingers and Foot, and Curing.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what has been dislocated from them be reduced with a little extension without effort: and indeed it is not difficult, nay rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick person should sit with his foot on an equal spot on the ground, or on a board: and he should stand as one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot over what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press that with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it is now equal, and does not appear in its elevated place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a board under his foot that will take the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind him with a bandage to a decent tightness for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days, until he is bound and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the Kinds of Dislocations with Wound or Fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens, and you attempt to cure it and restore the person, death often follows many times: and because of that, one should not assume about curing it, unless he is wise in long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not bold or presumptuous: and use remedies for incipience, which soothe warm abscesses only: and leave the sick person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for salvation from destruction with the gentleness of illness, and where something appears to give rise to hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	So then perform immediately at the beginning of the thing, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	So then if the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that soothes the abscess; and care for the wound with ointments that are drying.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if there is a dislocation with fracture, and the separated fragments are situated in bone, then try to remove them; and do as we said for simple illnesses in those places from which it preceded.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: just as my preceding prediction has come to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more safe for your body among those in your time.
