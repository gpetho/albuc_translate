About the cure of children who are born with the urinary passage not perforated.
Sometimes some children are born from their motherâ€™s womb and the tip of their urethra is not perforated (or the hole is narrow or not in the right place).
Then it is necessary to perforate it as soon as the child is born with a very fine spatula in this shape:
Then place a thin lead nail in the hole and tie it, and keep it there for three or four days.
And when the child wants to urinate, it should be removed and let him urinate; then reinsert it.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine that goes over the spot will not allow it to close.
But for the one whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for several days until it widens.
But those in which the hole is not in the right place, it means, in those cases, where the child is born and the hole is at the end of the tip of the penis so that he cannot urinate downward unless he lifts the penis with his hand upward; and this is not normal, because the sperm cannot reach the mother properly, and it is a serious illness.
And the way to operate is that the patient lies on his back, and then extend the tip of the penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the penis from the foreskin with a sharp spatula, like a feather incision, or shave off a part, so that the middle of it becomes like the tip of the penis and the hole falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful during your operation of the blood flow, because this often happens; and stop it with something that stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
