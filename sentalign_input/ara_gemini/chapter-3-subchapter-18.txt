Chapter Eighteen on the fracture of the woman's clitoris and the pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, sit her cross-legged, then bend her slightly towards her back, and let someone hold her from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva. Then shake the woman and lift her back slightly, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the entrance of the vulva like a ball and the bone fracture returns to place.
Then place a support on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently until she urinates and return it in the same way you inserted it first. Then she returns to her initial support.
Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal.
If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva, then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place.
Then pack it with cotton and stay for days as we described until it heals.
As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use what we described for the hip bone to repair and straighten it.
The correct approach in these strange fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience who understands this book of mine well, should not be hidden from you, because the fracture itself in most cases guides you to the correct way to repair and tighten it, so understand.
As for a man's penis, if it is fractured, take the gullet of a goose and insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth on it and bind it and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
