On the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, intense, continuous catarrhs happen to someone: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already their vision has been impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is a sharp, damaging pain, and subsequent sneezing: then you may conclude from these symptoms, that these matters, and catarrhs, come only from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this.
And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly on one side, across the width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is revealed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old cotton, or with linen strips.
Then compress from above with cushions: and soak the cushions with wine and oil, so that hot swelling does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot swelling is already reduced: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to stimulate flesh growth in these wounds.
