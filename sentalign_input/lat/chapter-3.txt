Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
Universal treatise on restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting, and similar matters.
Chapter 1.
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine and concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Know, O Sons, that foolish doctors and the common people boast of this chapter, though they have never looked into any ancient book nor read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, this method of knowledge is deprived in our land.
And I have never found anything good in it, nor did I gain anything from it except through extensive reading of ancient books and studying their understanding, until I extracted its knowledge from them.
Then I applied myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And now I have written for you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains on this matter, based on my experiments, after I have abbreviated it for you, freed it from unnecessary length, abbreviated it to the point of abbreviation, and demonstrated it clearly; I have also designed many forms of instruments used in it, with added details, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
