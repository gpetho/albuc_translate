Of the fracture of the foot bones
Fractures do not occur at the ankle, but sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the foot and rarely in the toes, and it usually results in a break in multiple places.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient place their foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press until they return to their places; then apply the poultice and padding, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot properly, after wrapping cloth around it, and other necessary things.
And after three or four days have passed, unbind the bandage, because you will find the bones are even, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, restore them as we said for the fingers of the hand; then place a splint on the fractured toe according to the length of the toe, and it should be a little wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it properly; and if two or three or more toes are fractured, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrap in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and stand on the edge of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds well.
And you must not forget the other things I said for other fractures, as we mentioned; and address each condition as needed.
