Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this for you, my son, this book, which is the final in the science of medicine with its supplement, and having reached the end thereof by its explanations and statements, it seemed good to me to complete it for you as well with this Treatise, that is, on surgery with hands-on practice.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since hand surgery is absent in our region and entirely from our time: until perhaps the science of it may have perished, its trace being severed: nothing remains of it but small descriptions in ancient books, which were carried out by hands: error and hesitation befell them until their intentions were closed off and their power was extended. It seemed good to me to vivify it with the organization of this Treatise in that manner according to its positions, statements, and abbreviations; and to come along with forms of tools for Cautery and other surgical instruments: made by additions from its declarations and necessary adjustments.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why no skilled artisan of it with his hands is found in this our time lies in the fact that the art of medicine is long-standing and its author must be versed beforehand in the science of anatomy narrated by Galen, until he knows the members' joints and their forms, and their connection and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their exiting and coming to rest, and pulsating movements and quietness, and places of egress.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason Hippocrune said that the name with a name is much, and little with the work, especially in hand art.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 However, we have already mentioned it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since he who is not knowing what we have mentioned about anatomy cannot be emptied out but falls into error where people are destroyed: as I have seen many of them formed from this science and boasting themselves without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 What I have seen is that a foolish doctor treated an abscess of the groin in a woman and accidentally punctured some artercuoses; therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from the bladder of an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore, he approached him and removed him with a broken urinary bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I myself had been summoned to remove him: and I saw from the great size of the stone and the patient's condition that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I have seen another doctor who was receiving payment at the home of a certain Duke because of his skill in medicine: and it happened to an eunuch of black complexion who was with him, that he broke his shin near the heel; and the doctor, out of ignorance, pulled on the fracture over the wound covered with dust, and applied strong straps without releasing the expiration from the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he released him according to his own desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Then he sent him away for several days and instructed him not to dissolve the bandage; and it stayed so until an abscess formed in his leg, and his foot, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was called then to him: and approached to dissolve the bandage; and calmness prevailed, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 But already the decay had been confirmed in that limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore the spreading of the decay stopped walking around the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I have seen another doctor who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it was ulcerated after days, until his wickedness with the master of himself had been magnified.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 That is because when the cancer is pure from black bile humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is on a part that can bear to have it completely removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for this reason my son, it is necessary that you know that the surgery is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with healing, and the operation where there are dangers in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already aroused at all points of this book, where the surgery comes with fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Why it is necessary for you to beware of that, and diminish it: so the foolish may not find a way to speak about it, and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and treat the weak among you with ease and firmness, and make use of a better way by the grace of God leading to health and praisewem: and dismiss grievous diseases difficult to heal: and lift up your spirits from that which makes you tremble, so there may be hesitation over you in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to the extent of yours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For indeed Galen has said in some of his exhortations.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 You do not heal the bad illness: do not call me physician of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now however this Treatise is divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 The chapter of the Burning with Fire and the Burning with Acute Medicine, arranged from head to feet, and forms of instruments, and tools for Cutting: and all that is necessary for surgery.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 The chapter of Amputation and Perforation, Phlebotomy and Pneumatism, Wounds: and Extraction of Arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter, arranged according to forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 Of restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torticollis, and suchlike: the chapter is ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 Book of Surgeon Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 § On Wounding and Harm of Cautery: and with which conditions it agrecuires, and when to apply: and if used with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But before recalling the procedure with that, it must be stated what are the quality of its Wounds and Hurtfulness: and how it is to be presented.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore I say that the speech on the quality of Wounding and Hurtfulnness of Cautery is a long, subtle discourse, a scientific knowledge, and an obscured mystery.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also many wise men have spoken on that matter and they disagreed among themselves: but for me it is enough with their speeches, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore I say that Cautery provides universally to all conditions which are with matter, and without matter: except for two conditions which are the hot condition without matter, and the dry one without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 For the condition of being warm and dry with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some have said that Cautery is beneficial for that.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of that, namely that Cautery is not suitable for an ailment which is from warmth and dryness; because nature of fire is warmth: and it does not suit to cure something with warmth and dryness if it comes from warmth and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite of that said: that there is wounding by Cautery on any warmth and dry ailment which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare the body of man with his humidities to the nature of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And indeed I say through him: because from experience he has already shown me that several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not necessary for him to come upon this unless he has already been tested and trained in the last exercise of Chapter Cautery, and has known the variety of human constitutions, and the disposition of diseases within themselves, and their causes, and incidents of those, and the duration of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 However, regarding the other constitutions there is no fear for you: especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For now all physicians have agreed on these, and they did not disagree with the healing by cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know you children that from the secret treatment by Cautery with fire is superior to Cautery with burning medicine, for fire is simple and its action does not reach except to the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm another connected limb with that one, unless a slight injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 However, the action of burning medicine reaches to that which is extended from limbs: and perhaps it causes a difficult-to-heal disease on the part itself, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 The fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless excessively.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 However, we have noticed that through experience and studying with art and standing in the truth of things: and because of this I excuse from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not, because this book of mine does not allow it: I would communicate to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation on bodies of expulsion of diseases by means of philosophical demonstration which has come to mind from your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know you children that they themselves disagree on the time when to make a cautery and suggest better time of day.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that caustic applies at all times; because harm caused by accident due to time is overcome by resting, which is drawn with a caustic.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if caustic is for pains from necessary, strong, sudden pain that does not tolerate delay: because fear arises from them, which is greater than the minor harm that passes by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And do not let that notion enter your minds, my son, which is not held by the wise and learned physicians, namely that illnesses which heal through caustics always return: they assert consequently, but things are not as they think: because caustic is only in medicine's place, which changes complexion, and drives out humidities that are causes, so pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, caustic is suitable for the swiftness of health and its strength, and its dominion: and it may be possible that the illness returns after some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and location of their illness, and their power; and what is prepared in their body from aggregation of superfluities therein: and what arrives to them through acquisition by foods, and such causes, unless it becomes an illness for which caustic is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle sickness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, like caustic for the toothache, since it is possible that such pain does not return therein.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But that happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But the speech of the crowd is right again, that caustic is medicine's last resort; it is not what they intend in this: for they believe, that there is no healing with medicine or other after dusk with caustics.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But on the contrary, that is intentional, as caustic is the last of medicine, it is not merely because when we administer methods of healing for a particular illness, these medicines do not suffice; then afterward we apply caustics at the end of the treatment and they are effective. Thus, it falls that caustics are the last of medicine, not according to the intention as the common people and many-scholar physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 And the ancients said that caustics with gold are better than caustics with iron; and they did not say so only because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not cause a pus-filled area at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 But that is not absolutely true; because I have already tested it and found that it does indeed cause [pus formation] in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And caustics with themselves are good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you kindle the caustic with fire from gold, it is not declared to you how much heat should be produced according to its amount that is used; and if it rushes towards coldness, and you add more ignition upon it, it melts in the flame and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Why does the craftsman fall into that occupation [of using caustics]: and because of that, caustics with iron are swifter and closer to us in practice due to their directness for application.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And indeed I have already ordered this chapter on caustics according to the chapters: and I have ordered those from head to feet, so that seekers may obtain what they want [information] from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 § The method of cauterization is at the coronal commissure.
Caput II.	 Head II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 This cauterization prevails over the dominion of moisture and coldness on top of the brain: these are two causes [of disease], namely, abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and pain in teeth, and throat pain; and universally all ailments that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, soddenness, epilepsy, apoplexy, and like diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is as follows: first attend to the sick person so that they may become clean with purifying medicine for three nights or four, according to what their strength and age require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct them to make waves on his head with needles.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then let him sit between your hands in a square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 However, when your middle finger has reached it, mark that spot with a non-burning touch.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then the fire of cauterization oil: which is this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with a non-burning touch, gradually pressing down with your hand and moving it back and forth.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly lift your hand and look at the location.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that it has now revealed a quantity of head fat or a quantity of marrow, then soothe your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat with your iron hand itself, or use something else from the same item if it becomes cold: until they see the bones that I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, drink the mixture, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then put over the consumed substance with butter, place it on the spot until the scab of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for that with four-drug ointer, and see if it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 Now they have said that the more open wound remains, the more it discharges pus; therefore it is better and more healing.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them have said that it should be cauterized to the bone; and keep the Cauterization until something dense in the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then a scraper is used after that which was burned in the bone, then it is treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that it is necessary for the cautery to approach until it makes an imprint on the bone so deep that the bone falls away like mold from clay: or a tool which women place with the alphabet of infusion; and they expel, as if vapors escape from this head area, and they let open wounds heal over a long period of time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 However, I do not recognize these two types of cautery at all except for a few people on the path of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And to let it go away is better with its own health in my opinion.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head is weakened by a discharge of its natural continuity: as we have testified about other limbs; and especially when the head with its disease is naturally weak: the first type of cautery, indeed, is more healthy and better for me, and I use it: therefore work with that in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Concerning the method of treating the headache throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 Head III. (This could be referring to a
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When pain occurs throughout the entire head chronically: and it is prolonged for the sick person, and used by others, including purgatives, balms, liniments, etc., and other methods mentioned before in this textbook section (referring to specific treatments like poultices or emplastrums).
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been treated with one type of cautery that we have mentioned and does not provide any relief from those methods: then consider the following (which likely refers to alternative or additional treatments for a patient who did not respond to initial treatment).
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the head is naturally strong and not weakened by disease, and finds intense cold: then treat with a different type of cautery underneath that lightly (suggesting adjustments in treatment based on symptoms like an "intense cold" sensation). This reflects the medical practice to tailor treatments according to specific symptoms.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then he cauterizes it with a caustic over the entire horn of his head using a caustic iron, so that the skin is not passed through and the amount of bone exposed corresponds to what we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And he cauterizes it with a causte iron once at the occiput of his head, at a place called ubac; and this is where the windpipe is situated: and be gentle therewith, so that the bone does not become exposed.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For he found weakened by this intense pain, and different from the pain of all other caustic treatments to the heads.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I shall say this Cauterium in its place: and it must be a caustic iron where the horns of the head are cauterized, and more delicately at the occiput with a finer caustic iron, which cauterizes the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Concerning the method of treating migraines, both with dry medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain occurs on the head and swells or extends to the eye, and it is purged with purifying medicines for the head, and the remainder of the treatment given as I have mentioned in divisions of sicknesses, without curing everything entirely: then the caustic application in this way has two methods: either a cauterization with an acute burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The caustic application with a burning medicine however, is as follows: you take one tooth from the same animal, and its bark, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then you split the pained area with a wide fleam until it becomes under the skin where one is to attach (the caustic iron).
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Therefore introduce it under the skin into itself until concealed: then bind over it with a decent constricting bandage of woolen thread; and leave it for fifteen hours, then extract it, and abandon it for two or three days: afterward place butter over the raw area so that it produces pus; then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you do this with some burning medicaments, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, concerning those brought from the East.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, cauterization of that thing with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The shape of the fire cautery, which is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called Guile: for the shape of its head resembles the form of a nail, within which there is something like tendernness, and there is also a small prominence in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand on it: and you will slowly draw out the iron with ease; and let the amount that is burnt be according to the thickness of the skin, as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And wet your hand so that the artery below does not get burnt and blood flow occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak the bale (cotum) in salt water and place it over the spot, and let it remain for three days; then place the bale with butter: afterwards cure with ointment until healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, perform this half-headache using a second cutting edge of the fire cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And close from the incision of the artery in this half-headache, not old of its own accord.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 In the manner of performing a fire cautery on an old headache.
Caput V.	 Head V (the fifth section or chapter).
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you are treating a headache with the methods we mentioned in previous curation and those described in diseases division, and if there is no effective treatment: and you see from the disease that what was applied to him first through fire cautery with medicine or through fire catury, then it should be done by fires of the fire cautery (cutellari) until he whitens after placing signs on the pain spot in a line whose length is half a finger or almost so: and let your hand rest for one time and tie it until you incise the artery and approach to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to ensure that the jawbone continues during chewing so as not to burn one side or the nerve that moves it, from which a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And let this also be done for the sternum and precautions regarding bleeding of the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For the incision of this fear is great and especially for him who knows not what to do, nor attentive, nor experienced: he immediately abandons the surgery.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come with a review of managing blood flow incidents from the artery according to its own way and place it in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 That if you see from the illness that it is not enough for him this cautery, and you see the body sick unable to bear the cautery on the head as we have described, then take care of the wound until healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you see, give a cautery as we have said in the chapter of extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Regarding the manner of cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When it occurs ear pain from cold, and is healed with ointments, and the rest of treatment as we have said in division, and if the pain does not subside, then a fire cautery: and this thing called Puncture, its form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the punctures after its burning around the ear as it subsides: or on both sides if there is pain in both at once.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend yourself with a cautery to the base of the ear just enough after you have recognized places with ointment: and let the quantity of the caster be ten points on each ear, as those ones.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the wounds until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Thus, concerning the method of cauterization during torture.
Caput VII.	 Head VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is treated by casterization, is none other than those arising from inflammations, as we have discussed in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And about common cauterization for types that occur from drying out and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When curing this type of torture with heat applications, purgatives, and gargles do not bring about your healing, then it should be cauterized on the sick person three times: one at the root of the ear, a second just below its position, and a third at the union of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weakened area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 For soothing does not occur except in areas that appear healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is such that you cauterize with a Cautery directly underne. 1/32-inch below the upper edge of the ear, and at the position of the ear: its length should be according to the width of your thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with a Cautery until it burns off a layer of skin of medium thickness.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of Cautery, and it is a type from a knife-edge whose shape has been given: yet it is not as subtle as you see, and it should be that the blade of the knife be slightly less in thickness than necessary.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then care for the areas with what preceded it until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Thus, concerning the method of casterization during ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Head VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When ancient apoplexy occurs, and curing it with what we have discussed does not bring about your healing, and the sick person has no fever, then you should cauterize them four times over all parts of their head, and with a Cautery in the middle of the head as we said, and with a Cautery at the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the form of the Cautery is according to what has been given.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Even after being cauterized with a hot iron on the sternum bone; and it is more of a last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it is treated as was previously done.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 By the method of cauterizing in an abscess.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in the bowl of a person suffering from a severe fever, and pills cleansing the brain are taken first.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then thoroughly cover the head of the sick person, and place over the occiput an ointment described in the treatise on plasters; apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is a method of cauterization: and do this secondly according to the same order as mentioned here.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals by that (method), it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which are descend from the upper part to the lower part of the eye; and place between every camoation a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cauterization as was previously done.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however a patient allows that (procedure): then do the camation on the middle (part).
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 That if you allow that (method): then cauterize it above two horns (of the nose).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for it until healed; and do a camation of oil according to the prescribed shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 By the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary to proceed with the cleansing of the head with feverfew and as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then thoroughly clean the head of a sick person; afterwards do camations with hot iron on the middle of his head, and on every horn of the head, and behind him, and three on each cervical vertebrae.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however you find in the patient a desire for softening of many parts of the body, and he allows it: then do four camations on his vertebrae of the back with a hot iron, and finally with a camation that burns through the skin to as much extent as possible, and olive oil (your hand).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then care for it until healed; and thus apply the olive oil caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Hence a method of cauterizing epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 The epileptic should not be cauterized unless his epilepscu is of the watery type.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, one must first cleanse his brain with antiseptics and then proceed with the rest of the treatment as we have discussed in our previous divisions: when ill, if he is very sick or can tolerate medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 But if it is a child who cannot take medicines, then he will be given a gargle and chewing substances that cleanse the brain, before many days with proper nutrition.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head afterwards and then cauterize it with a single caustic in the middle of the head as was done before; and with another caustic on its back, and over all corners of his head with a caust icium.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 But if he is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize with the caustics as I have mentioned in having paralysis, and mollification of the body over the spines of the neck and back: and let there be applied an olive oil caustic according to the previous method.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 But if he is a sickly child, then apply a subtle caustic in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	 Hence a method of cauterizing melancholy.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the causes of melancholy are rotten moistures and thick mucus, then cauterize with the caustics as we have mentioned in having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melaniecholy is excessive discharge leading to melaniecholy and his body being a sickly wetness, then give him something in drink that cleanses his brain as was done previously: afterwards shave the head of the sick person, and then make afterward a neat round from linen.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it on the middle of the head; and the patient sitting should hold it firmly from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Next, apply an ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more valuable than ancient butter oil.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 Heat the substance over a fire, measured by hand when introduced into it, to be warmly heated.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then immerse (it) in a circle at the center of his head and release it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Let him do this once every week with other good treatment, until cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if necessary, burn (it) by making many small points on it, but hold the hand with a brand: let it be sweet-smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of burning moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter or goose fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	 § In this manner of descending cauterization to the eye.
Caput XIII.	 Head XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When it is told to you the principle of water entering the eye through signs which I have said in division, then start and give a drink to the patient with what cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And protect it from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath on fasting days for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then order him to shave his head, and burn it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then burn it with two points of fire, if there is simultaneous descent of water into both eyes: or from one side, if there is descent of water into one eye; and separate with fire all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterizations be long in length and breadth as the points of fire: and they may cease bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 That if you see anything from it, then immediately separate with whatever medication is possible; and I will come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of veins, and their separation, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it is burned with a hot iron under two bones using two final implements.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	 Therefore, the ancient method of cauterization.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the lachrymae oculorum (tears from the eyes) are ancient: they should be frequent and located above the temples, along with arteries that lie on the outer part of the head; it is ascertained that these result from an excess of cold and phlegmatic substances. Then one cauterizes with a hot iron as described in the descent of water (from Albucasis's text), using a caustic in the middle of the head, along with two final implements above two points on each side, and another pair beneath two bones underne.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if you add anything more, then it is burned around every side of the eye with a small hot iron over the eyebrow ends.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	 Therefore, the method of cauterization for foetor (stench) from the nose.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	 When you treat this (referring to a previously discussed condition) and it does not respond to medication as stated: then promptly, administer three nights in a row infirmocochias (an ancient term possibly referring to an enema or other internal treatment), thereafter shave the head of the patient and cauterize with a medium-hot iron using olive oil.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then one should cauterize with a hot iron and two final implements above the eyebrows just underneck hairs.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And be careful not to injure it by cutting an artery.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 And this is the method of cauterization for the eyebrows.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 Therefore, the technique of cauterization for softening (mollification) of the eyelids.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelids are softened by an affliction or moisture: then one should cauterize the eyelid with a single iron and this hot iron made of moon metal (lunar).
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if it is flesh, burn above two eyebrows with a pair of branding irons on all sides; and they are to be extended from the two temples; and the length of every branding iron should correspond to the lengths of the eyebrow; and do not end your hand along with the branding iron, but according to the amount that has been burned, a third of the eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the crescent-shaped branding iron in accordance with this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 In such a manner, when performing the eyelid burn, one uses prickly hairs facing the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The branding iron is of two types: either the one with fire or the one with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 But in the branding iron with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let go of his hairs, if they are among those who cleanse them, until they have grown and evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 But if they prick him at his own beginning: then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born. Note: This instruction seems to be incorrect or misinterpreted as it might refer to the healing process after cauterization rather than during the procedure itself, which requires clarification from historical medical texts and expert knowledge of ancient surgical practices for accurate translation.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and evened out, then place the patient's head in your lap: afterwards, draw signs on his eyelids with hot wax, a mark that corresponds to the shape of Myrtle leaves: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place soaked bark on a wax paper: or in psyllium gel over the eye. (Note: The material "psyllium" refers to plantago seeds, which were used historically for their medicinal properties, including as a poultice.)
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then with fire of branding iron, whose form is this. (Note: The specific details or illustration of the shape should be based on historical descriptions or images
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize over the figure you have drawn gradually into many strips, until the surface of the skin is burned off completely, which corresponds to the entire shape of Myrtle leaves. (Note: The method and extent of strip cauterization should be consistent with historical medical texts, ensuring that modern interpretations do not deviate from authentic practices.)
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And a sign of healing from your work is this: if you see the eyelid of the eye beginning to contract near the wound, and remove hairs around the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then cleanse thy hand at that time, and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 And then place a piece of cotton with butter on the wound until the slough is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 But if hairs return after a day and soften the eyelid, then apply cautery to that place again as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 But if hairs are on the lower side: then apply c지오터리 to that, until it relaxes back to its natural place; and smoothes so as not to prickle the eye with hairs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 Regarding applying cautery together with a burning medicine in this case.
Caput XVIII.	 Head XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 That you should instruct the sick man to discard his hairs until they are grown and smoothed.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from paper cloth the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from the known soap and from one of the two scales not imbibed, an ounce or so of weight similar to that: then wipe it with good friction at once, and make this quickly so as not to cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take some of that and spread it on the paper as you made a leaf of myrtle, and place this over one or two eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye soaked cotton on a protein cloth: and let the sick man's head be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your finger over the medicine and press it lightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move that as often as the sick man feels a sting from the medicine, for it found its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 But while this continues as he himself finds the sting, then discard the medicine and move that with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 Therefore, when the sting subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then, if you see the eyelid swelling up, as it is relieved during contraction with fire or cutting, this is good; and if not, repeat over the same area using medicine above the place where no medicinal impression was made, without making it darker, until your operation succeeds and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then apply over it a mixture of Butyrum [Butter], until the burned skin is healed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment called Diaphinicon or another, until healed. (Note: Diaphinicon appears to be a historical term not easily identifiable in contemporary sources; the translation is provided based on
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during surgery to maintain the final safeguard, that nothing from the medicine should fall into the eye. (Note: The term "ultima custodia" can be interpreted as a metaphrenologic expression meaning 'the last thing to take care of' or 'final precaution')
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid softens after a day and struggles with some blood vessels from within the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which has been made softer by the eyelid itself, as you did firstly. (Note: "mollificatur" suggests 'softened' or 'eased', indicating an intended effect of a treatment; "capillis" refers to blood vessels)
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the form of Myrtus leaf. (Note: The term 'forma folii' could be
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes vary greatly in size and thickness. (Note: "diuersificantur" means 'vary' or 'differ', emphasizing the natural variation among individuals)
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, according to that, your consideration should be: and do not let the right path, which is the study of this art, be hidden. (Note: "via rectitudinis" metaphorically refers to 'the right way' or 'correct path,' highlighting a philosophical aspect related to the pursuit of medical knowledge)

Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When treating an abscess, when the method we discussed for treating diseases does not yield results: then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Instruct the sick person to place their head in your lap and hold it with their hands as if not to move or stir while holding their own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place the soaked gauze on his forehead or in a liquid psyllium over his eye: then of cautery fire, whose shape is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Make the recess as if of a reed pen's shaft from one end, with which cautery is done: and if it may be piercing up to the other end, and if it may be tried in that manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this recess is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then drain the abscess if it is open and remove it with a healthy vessel, and extract it: and if it is not open, then make an opening in it, and extract the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place over it cautery that is burned very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold with your hand slightly at the cautery near the eye to the nostril so that your hand does not rest or disturb the sick person: and place the ccuetery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If then you reach with the beginning of your cautery up to his mouth, it will be well done.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need to do so: and dismiss it after three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place gauze with butter on it and care for it with an extracting ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if after forty days it does not heal: then place an acute and corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed: and cut away the diseased part according to what appears in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another way of a cautery for wounds, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Then aim at the location of the wound and find it; afterwards place into that crack a small pipe called Camahan, which is a subtle tube with this shape:
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it the quantity of lead melted in a drachma; and hold your hand with the Canna retentione good, and do not move the sick person at all so that he does not run or come to the melted lead reaching his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary to place over the sick man's eye a cloth soaked in albumen or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead indeed burns the location of the wound and heals it with miraculous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If it is healed by a fistula, along with what we have mentioned from the Cautery and its treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal opening and reduce the fistula according to its course back to its proper place for itself.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 So when you treat these cracks as we mentioned in the division of illnesses and if it does not bring about healing, then a small knife's edge cautery according to this shape:
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its depression be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then quickly place the burning one into the cracks themselves until the cautery reaches deeply into the cracks.

When an abscess occurs at the root of the gums, or on the palate, or in the roots of teeth: then it produces pus and bursts open: afterwards it is drained, and pus flows out, creating a fistula: then you must care for the wound itself, and not add to its healing process at that time; then it should be treated with cauterizing irons in accordance with the amount that fits into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert a red-hot object into the fistula opening and hold your hand on it until the hot iron reaches deep within, and has done its work completely; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then care for that (the wound) after that, as we have said about the healing up to a certain point.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If, however, the pus is discharged and it heals, then this will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the decayed bone according to what will come forth in its own head.

When the gums are softened due to moisture and teeth move, and you care for it with medicines but do not strengthen; then place the ailing head in your bosom.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then place a cauterizing iron of whatever form is needed after this, so that you put a cannula over the tooth: and quickly insert the red-hot cauterizing iron into it; and hold your hand on it slightly, until the ailing head feels that the heat from the fire has already reached the root of the towed.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And be gentle with your hand; then repeat the cauterizing several times according to what you see fit.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the ailing head fill its own bone with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and then spit it out.

Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When dental pain is due to coldness or the area itself is cold, and no relief comes with medicines: then a cautery applied in two ways: either a cautery with butter or a caterey with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 A cautery with butter is made by melting the butter and pouring it into a bronze cup or in a wound.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take pitch (pitch), and apply it to the tip of your finger.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse the item in melted butter and quickly place it on the painful to cuff, holding it until it cools; then repeat several times until the heat's power reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if possible, immerse wool or pitch in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place hot iron over it until heat reaches deep into the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 A cautery with fire is done by focusing on an air tube or a steel tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And it should have some bulk in its body so that the heat's sharpness does not reach the sick mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then a fire cautery, whose shape comes to be: and place it on the tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do that several times, for pain will be relieved or within that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is to be done with the impression of that cautery, so that it fills the sick mouth with good butter and holds for an hour; then spits out what's inside.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the form of a cautery.

When the styes are from phlegm and cold humors, and do not yield to digestion by medicines, and their juices promote digestion quickly: then apply a depressed cautery of this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends to allow the smoke to exit from a cautery at one end: and place it on top of the sore once, or twice if necessary, until you reach deep into the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the abscess is large: then place a camo according to its size.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then remove it after three days and apply the following poultice made of butter until what was burned by fire is healed.

Then apply the cautery on a crater near the roots of the throat at an indented place: and carefully avoid reaching with the camo to the throat or the skin, except for some part of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then apply another camo on the junction of the neck at its last vertebrae: and let the cautery be blunt according to what has been used before.

When the cough and lung illness are due to cold humidities, and the patient does not have a fever, nor consumption, and is an old condition: then one should cauterize it with two caustic burns above the hookbones in depressed, soft, weak spots.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another caustic on the chest between two nipples; and let the cautery of the tube be according to the shape that preceded it.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your cauterization is by pricking with a caustic called "Puncture," whose form preceded it in earache-pricking, then there shall be points from thirty pricks almost to the other [side].

When the head is displaced due to an assistant's humidity, and it does not fit its own time of return from dislocation, until that habit has been established for him, then after a slight movement which happens as we have already testified about this, one must reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies down on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then apply a compress of beef fat that is inside the titillating area on top with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inner side.

Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes it happens that the cauterization is done with a cauldron having three sides, so then the shape of caturization has six cauldrons because they are according to the subtlety of what is tried.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of cauterization having three sides.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes one more mode is added to it, so there are eight cauldrons.

Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if the dislocation is towards the top and rarely it happens like that, then you should cauterize the same over the shoulder with a cauldron or by pricking many cauldrons.

When it happens in the stomach coldness and many humidities until they extract from their own constitution, and increase sneezing to it, and frequent cures are not applied: then one should have the sick person lie on his back, extend his legs and arms.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then you should cauterize with three cauldrons, using the cauldron of a spoon's size from under the chest and another cauldron for clavicles, and two other ones below the sides of one of them, until it comes in the shape of triangular cauldrons.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And lengthen between both so that they do not join when there is pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And let the shape of the cauters be according to this model without addition, and if you want to cauterize with a large caustic in the middle of the stomach according to this model, and let the cautery that makes this one cautery according to the model of a circle follow this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 And the stomach is to be cauterized by touching with it that is troubled by this caustic: and there are signs above the stnagram of a point according to the quantity you use with an encaustic; then cauterize it with the caustic of puncturing: then care for it with the treatment, which continues until healed.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When in the liver, pain is caused by coldness and moisture or by heavy winds until it departs from its natural excessive discharge of humors; and when treating with what we mentioned above does not help: then one should lay the patient down on his back, and make three cauterizations according to this model using an encaustic in the same quantity below the epiploon where the man's foot reaches, and let there be space equal to every caustic according to finger breadth; and let a caustic follow the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the causte too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity that is burnt be according to the thickness of the skin, two-thirds of this amount without addition; and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 But if not standing, then lying down, with extended legs and raised arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of a caustic.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize this caustic with a scalpel knife when subtlety and prudence are present in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And be on guard that you do not proceed to the end of cauterization, and let it become thickened throughout the skin so that the entire body is burned, and reaches the intestines: for therein the skin is subtle, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 ¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing abscesses in the liver.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When an outflow occurs and you know that the abscess is either in the liver tissue or its membrane: then if it is in the liaber tissue, a sick person experiences painful weakness and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver's membrane, there is pain accompanied by acute swelling. And you see that it has exhausted doctors with its treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 It should be ensured that the sick person lies on their back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then determine the location of the abscess with an incandescent stick; then the fires of a caustic that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And you cauterize it with that caustic stick once the skin has been completely burned and reaches the spleen until all pus is discharged; then attend to its treatment of abscesses, until healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it should not be that this type of caustic is used, except by one whose study in the art of medicine persists: and those sicknesses come to his hands through frequent experiments; then indeed he may dare over such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But I prefer to let it go as is.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 ¶ Regarding the method of cauterization in the pleura.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter anno intestinorum septem membrorum
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that with the caustic root of Aristolochia for a cold pleura according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is as follows: you receive from the roots of dry Aristolochia such that there is one root longer than the rest, which can be found among them, and let its size be like that of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil; and ignite it with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with a single caustic on that which is between the extension of the furrow and neck, and two equal caustics near it under small declivities toward the lower part, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two caustics also on that which is between the fifth and sixth declivities toward the back: and with another caustic in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three caustics from the back: one on that which is between two spoons; and two caustics from each side of the chest, lower caustic being between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not proper to compress your hand with a caustic; rather let it be on the bare skin smelling sweetly.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And now some ancient ones have said that there are men who use a caustic made from iron like the radius; and they ignite it, and put it inside between the ribs until it reaches near to the spot of the ulcer, and pus comes out: as we have discussed in the ulceration of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with a caustic there is fear, that either the sick person dies immediately or an abscess occurs at the spot without healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 § On the manner of performing Cauterization on the spleen in Chapter LXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the sickness of the spleen with what we have discussed for treatment in the division of diseases, and your therapy does not provide relief, then the caustic is applied according to three modes, all of which are correct:
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 Of those who are one, make three types of cautery or four, lining according to the length of the spleen following the shape of the cauldrons on the liver, whose form preceded it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let there be in all types of cautery a quantity proportional to thickness with the finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And let the mode of cautery that we mentioned for the liver be equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not squeeze your hand with the cautery: and let him who is ill lie down on his back over his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 And another way of cauterization is to hold the hot iron as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and oil skin that is directly on the spleen where the left arm approaches: and let your oiling be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two hot irons deeply until they pierce the skin on one side: then remove the cautery: so four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you want to do a cauterization with another cautery having three irons.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you have thrown it away, let many days pass: for it is more in continuation and what remains from healing that preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Paragraph on how to cauterize in hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall in hydropsy unless it is an enema by itself.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you are healing the hydropsy with the methods of healing that we mentioned in division, and if it does not improve, then one must do a caterization four times around the navel, and with an iron on top of the stomach, and another iron over the liver, and an iron over the spleen, and two irons between the vertebrae after the back, and one in directness to the chest, and another in directness to the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then insert an open cautery so that it discharges pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not leave the sick person untreated after cautery with it: that which should be done is to join two intentions for him, so that he may hasten to recovery with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The shape of the cautery with which the upper part is cauterized should be a copper tube; according to its preceding form: and that with which the back is caturized should have an oilier appearance, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Regarding the method of cauterizing feet and shanks.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When hydropenia occurs and they are filled with yellowish water: one should cauterize the back of the foot between the ear-hole and the ring finger: then gently press it with your hand using a cautery, and do not twist it: then again gently press it with your hand: and do not move it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 And the yellowish water will drain out, and let there be a cautery according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on both shanks, and let there be a cautery with the tip of the knife-like cautery: and let there be a catury according to the length of the leg, one below it, and another lower down about in the middle of the leg: and above every hip two cauteries: then insert an open cautery without treatment over a long time so that some liquid drains from it: then care for the wound with the other treatments we mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Regarding the method of cauterizing on ventricular fissure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When there is a discharge from the ventricular fissure due to cold and humidity until it weakens retentive and digestive forces that are in the stomach and intestines: and treat this with methods of treatment, and it does not heal: and you see a sick person who tolerates an abundant cautery, then cauterize it with a large cautery over their own stomach according to how it preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery and four fine cauteries around the navel with a very fine cautery: and on a copper plate above the calves, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize that with a caustic on the chest, and also with a causturtion over the entire area; and perhaps add two small causturations near the upper part of the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 And indeed this treatment is successful, whose aim does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 § Regarding the method of causturing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Head XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from gross humors, coldness, or corrupt moisture, and healed with that which we mentioned in division XLIII, and do not yield a cure: then caution with three causturizations over the lower spine of the back slightly less than triangularly, and with a caustion under the navel as if by two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food does not digest, and you see him swelling up, then caution with a large caustic over the stabdomen, as it preceded: also with a caustic over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a sickle-shaped caustic: and remove the open cauterization after some time; afterwards, treat him until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 § Regarding the method of cautioning the alathelus after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Head XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut off the alathelus, then apply caustic fires similar to a ray (possibly referring to a grid or pattern of application).
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert a burning item into the cut-off alathelus: and with your last hand, until it reaches the healing point through which blood flows: do this once or twice (indicating repeated applications as necessary).
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If then the alatheluses are many, then caution each one with a caustic as we have mentioned before (referring to earlier instructions for this process).
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then attend to that which is provided for them from ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large caustic on the clot, it is more of an extreme measure in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Thus, regarding the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey the surgery and operation that I have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps healed with a caustic.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 And so when it happens to someone that a fanciulliarum are being used in the process of making muffins as part of their decorative design or for added texture and flavor? This is indeed an unconventional use but not entirely outlandish, especially within artisanal baking circles. Chocolate chips can provide burst
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, it must be done as I have written, with a fine probe gently inserted.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then know the amount of depth by using that same probe carefully.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then use caustic irons, which are similar to a pair of tongs.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself with hot iron into the fistula and measure how much it goes in using the clasp.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat with hot iron upon it until all the decayed body parts are burned away, once, twice or thrice, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And protect yourself from being burned by nerves if they are there, or with large ointments; and if the fanciulliarum leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestines, then protect yourself from those places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not do this unless the fanciulliarum is on a fleshly place; and think because it does not pierce deeply.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the area until it heals completely.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place is sealed and separated from it materials, and remains for a long time like this; then you know that it has been healed thoroughly.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if they do not separate the matter from him, then you know that it is pervasive, or his deep bone is rotten, or somewhat like those: whose memory will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Of a way of cauterizing Kidneebones.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain from the kidneys occurs due to cold or gross winds and it decreases because of a sickness, then one should apply cauterization over almethenum upon these kidneebones using a hot iron, as well as above every kidney with an awl-like instrument whose memory precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we may apply cauterization again within the same almethenum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three lines come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore they will be more powerful during sleeping. (Note: This translation assumes that "juuentament" is a typo or corruption of the
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Of a way of cauterizing Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter Forty.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness occurs in the bladder and mollification from cold and humidities until it no longer retains urine of the sick one, then apply cauterization to its lower part above the bladder where pubic hair begins with a hot iron from the right side of the pubis, and another with an awl-like instrument from the left side of that: and let the length of the second lateral cauterization be according to the quantity of knots on the thumb; then apply caterization above it using the backside or two hot irons if you discern it, as follows depending upon what precedes with a hot iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Of a way of cauterizing Womb.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter Forty-One.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When frigidity and humidities occur in the womb preventing pregnancy, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and the stimulation of those is delayed, and pain at their approach occurs to it, then one should apply three hot irons around its navel as we have said before in cauterizing the bladder, with a hot iron over the lower part of its backside or two hot irons: and let there be an awl-used cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Of the way to cauterize an anchor in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the moistures of the mucous membrane flow into an anchor's bag and cause its departure from its place; and a sign of this is that the leg is stretched towards another, when they approach the hollow: it is found that the location of dislocation in that empty space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weakened area above the anchor'cuś own caustic (cauterizer) with a similar circle; after you mark along the incandescent with an encaustic (wax-based pigment for painting or writing), as it turns: and that the bag itself may fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let there be a caustic whose shape precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 But if you do not have this caustic at hand, then cauterize it with three caustics, using a large oil caustic; and let the depth of the caustic be according to the thickness of the skin throughout its entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Of the way to cauterize in sciatica. (Please note that this instruction refers to a different condition than "anchor dislocation" from
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43. (The continuation follows the same pattern as
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the anchor's bag, and its cause is coldness and moistures; and treat the weakened as we have said in diuisio, and it does not provide a cure, and that thing becomes old: then you must dissolve the infirmity with humors of gross pills or with foul-smelling pills, or artificial ones, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize it. (This statement directly follows from the previous steps in treating the
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of caustic for this is in two ways: either with a caustic with approaching medicines or with a caustric with fire. (This instruction continues to provide guidance on the treatment process.)
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 The cautery with fire exists in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 Whose one is it to cauterize above the pile of its three pyres, according to this pattern.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And there should be space which is between all the cauteries in quantity and thickness of a finger; and the cautery should have an oil layer.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Whenever, however, it happens that the catury is on top over the head of its pile itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the method of cautery for displacement of its pile, one: let the circle contain the whole pile.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And char the entire thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is a way of cautery for sciatica when pain sticks to its pile itself and does not extend up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends up to the hip and leg, then you cauterize the pile with two cauteries over the thigh, over the place where the patient is directed by pain, which is in a part of its sylvester about four finger-widths: and let the cautery be ringed.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 Which if the patient indicates that pain extends up to near the toes, then you should cauterize there where he points with a punching-cauter, three or four times, or more often, as it needs.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that pain is under the knee to the leg, then you should cauterize there with a ringed-cauter once.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And caution yourself in all your cauterizations that you do not end with the cautery on this matter of burning nerves or great vessels and dragging through it over the patient's bad harm or spasm.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 Indeed, I have seen one and another among those who cauterized above the calf, and they continued in cauterization; the leg became swoln until the tumor adhered to the foot, and it was pierced entirely, and the whole foot decayed: then there occurred discharge from the veins, and death followed after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If pain is present on both sides simultaneously, caution should be taken to treat each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And certain wise men have said something about the cauterization of armpits using this particular method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar piece of metal called "samio," whose diameter is half a palm: and it should be placed at the hole's opening according to the size of the nail head, or slightly less; and within that samio, there should be another samio.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And there should be space equivalent to the amount of knots on one's thumb between all the samios: and the openings of the samios should be from both sides; and their height should resemble that of a single knot, or two knots: and construct handles for them appropriately using metal.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it should be heated in fire until red hot, and emit sparks; then place it over a small box on the sick person lying with one healthy side resting against the other.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 So caution him by applying three round cauterizations in one spot.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then release it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Later apply plasters with butter; and leave an open wound uncovered for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then tend to it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis, we seldom use this type of cauterization with sons, because of the fear of its appearance; and therefore, few people are found who seek treatment on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 However, he is one of those who endure well with such a procedure, and has been discovered to be successful at that place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 However, when the cautery is ready with the medicines arriving, you shall make two Samite rings having perforated armills, into which descends the card of its gate made of bronze or iron, whose lengths in altitude are two knots or almost so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be a space that is between the two quantities of thickness of the finger, and they are open lower and upper ones: and may it hold liquid according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then lay her down on an anchor-shaped piece, lying weakly over the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand strongly over the anchor-shaped piece.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between the two circles of warm water that is heated with fire just enough, and hold it for a time period: and let the sick person endure its biting, and its burning, for indeed he found biting like fire, until rests the biting.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then oint your hand with a tool, and cleanse the anchor entirely with warm water mixed with sweet water: then dismiss it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter over that, until the blackness of burning disappears: and dismiss it for some days, and may pus flow from there.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For indeed is the last thing in recovery.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that with ointments until healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 But if pain extends to the thigh or leg: make him a stand that contains water as you did on the anchor equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is a method of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise of the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take lye and unburnt chalk of both parts one side each: break them up and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole according to the length that enters it: and place under the bottom of the pot another earthenware pot: and throw over the lye and chwartz from sweet water, which submerges both by finger's width: after you press them well with your hand in good compression: and dismiss the pots until water runs down from the lower part of the unglazed pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then collect all that water and pour it over another limestone; let it stand until it curdles.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 It will then be very powerful and sharp for use in many surgical operations of medicine, and for the cauterization of other body parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 For it causes the effect through its own fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines are those with which haunches (femoral arteries) are cauterized, such as thesesy, melaic acid, and lime mixed with soap; that both may be combined.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And indeed, Galen has recounted the healing of a man from ancient times for the pain in his thigh and sciatic nerve; and he greatly praised its efficacy.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not need another remedy and that he was cured by a single treatment until he declared, perhaps because he had taken an internal bath, and was now free from it.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from the green seeds of aloe vera; and if not found in aloe veroa recenta should be used: and heaped up with a good deal of butter, placed over the thighs where there is pain or leg or hip; and bound, and let go for a quantity of three hours, or according to how much the patient feels weakness from burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 For when his body becomes sweaty, introduce it into a chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For indeed pain subsides and healing occurs.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that it is not necessary for someone to use any cautery with these remedies unless after evacuating the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorirus who said that goat dung, when applied with it to the sciatic nerve, brings benefits; and this is how a cautery is made according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and moisten with ancient oil, and place it on a deep spot between the thumb of the foot and the little toe, and is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung and ignite it with fire until it becomes charcoeburned charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Next, place it on the wool, and let it burn out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Therefore do not cease to do this until a sense of moderation is reached up to the ankle and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called Vaccine causticry. (Note: The term "cauterium vaccinum" does not directly translate to modern English, but it seems
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Regarding the cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 42.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Occasionally, pain occurs in the back due to various causes or falls, blows, excessive evacuation, and similar issues, from infusion of cold materials: indeed, cauterization does not apply except in this species alone that arises from infusion of cold material. (Note: The text is a bit more complex here as it deals with specific medical conditions and treatments.)
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar treatments, let them be made over the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of its spine, after signs with encaustic in every line five cauterizations or more depending on the quantity that comes from the endurance of the strength of said patient: and it should be a cautionery cauterization. (Note: This text includes specific instructions for medical treatment following evacuation using foul pills, indicating a series of lines with encaustic applications.)
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if so, cautionery three or four cauterizations with a middle clay cautery according to this pattern. (Note: This sentence continues the instructions on applying causticrye patterns for medical treatments.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Regarding the method of cauterization in cases of swelling due to tumors. (Note: The text now moves onto addressing a specific condition - "Gibbositas," which could be interpreted as a
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often occurs in elderly infants. (Note: The text has shifted to discussing the occurrence of the mentioned condition in older children.)
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its onset in children is as follows: it occurs with a stricture during breathing and movement; and you find it at the last dorsal vertebra and nodes, which have now begun to stand out above the other adjacent vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you see this and are to do that, then cauterize it with a cautery in the shape of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And take the caustic around the entire vertebra evenly; and if you are to cauterize it around the perimeter of the vertebra with a caustic in the shape of two or three points, let them be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for that place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer the caustic on the bulging which occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 In this manner of treating gout and joint pains: (Translation should be continued based on a specific method described by Albucasis for the treatment mentioned)
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46. (This indicates that the text is part of
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are from cold humors that flow into each part of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call them gout by proper name. (This continues with a description of treatments or observations related to gout as per Albucasis)
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Therefore, when gout from cold causes is treated with methods of healing, and the pangs do not recede, then caustic removes them. (This should detail a specific treatment method involving caustics for conditions that do not improve with conventional treatments)
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is, as to cauterize after evacuating the perimeter of the foot joints with many caustics: and let the caustic be made from olive oil. (Here a specific procedure for applying caustics in treatment is described)
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form. (The sentence indicates that what follows will describe a certain method or
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you find points on the sole of the foot, then do with the caustic in the shape of points. (This sentence suggests an alternative treatment involving point-shaped caustics)
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If pain rises up to the knees or other joints and this often happens, then cauterize it with three or four cauteries from every side using the same Caulius rod.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 However, if you need more than that by this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, only to the thickness of the skin at most.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 However, if pain rises to the knees and back: then apply what we mentioned from the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 But if pain is only in the hands, then make points around the edge of the flame as two lines fade away.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 And if pain remains only in the fingers, then make points on them, a point over every knot and over the chest of hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 But if pain rises after days to the ankles or elbows, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not leave a sick person alone under good care, with medicine intake.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if it becomes good care, and the phlegm is reduced, he will be healed by God's help with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Of the manner of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture happens in the groins and descends intestine or grizzle to the testicle, and it is beginning near: then you should advise the sick person to dismiss purgation on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And use purgatives so that feces can come down from their bladder.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit between your hands over his back: and tell him to hold his breathing until it is expelled or appears grizzle or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then pull it with your fingers and make signs under the rupture over the chest of hand, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then use a hot iron, which is this form, until it arrivamoon and throws out small sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then roll back the intestine or insert an enema into its own cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then place the minister's hand on that spot so that it does not exit: and you have already opened between his thighs, and placed underneath lint, and another servant over his thighs, and another over his chest holding hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then remove the iron from that mark with your hand holding the iron upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold it until you reach the bone with it: or try again with another one if you have not reached up to the bone with it at first.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe whether there is any discharge from the intestine at the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn it and stop by this over the patient or death or great wickedness.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the bone with the iron, your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it must be an iron for infants fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care with the remaining ointments until healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is bandaged.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary to place food for him according to the length of his healing time, which soothes his humors: that the intestine does not exit in effort and discharge.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a badly made bandage and hold it for another forty days by others.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And lessen the labor, and supply food and drink, and strong words.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he uses this regime, thus he is fully healed in a complete cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will speak of the treatment for ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 Whenever ruptures occur in the other entrails and are beginning, and it is desired that they not be joined, then cauterize the rupture with a round caustic according to its amount: but let what is burned therewith be as the third (part).
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then care for it in what we said: and do not join them.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And now some of the first ones have said: to be burned with a rupture and an angular caustic according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with the caustic, and a line which is through the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another to below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And put your hand in the middle with a lancet.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first caustic is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 § On the manner of cauterizing pain due to an injury or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When it happens in certain limbs from an injury or percussion: and the pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to any care with drugs: then one must be burned with a pointed caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the caustic of every limb be a second caustic according to its size, and weakening it, and weakness thereof, and strength thereof, and twisting therefrom, and pain from that.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If however it is healed with the first caustic, then it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the caustic on top of that.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 For it is customary for these pains to be transferred from a limb to what approaches them.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore one must follow up on them with caustic until the sick is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 § On the manner of cauterizing leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 But lepers are sometimes aided by caustic in the greatest healing.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 Therefore, especially with leprosy cases, which occur due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; so when considering cauterization on that part.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If therefore leprosy is not healing and it does not progress nor stabilize with the treatment as we discussed in division, and there are no signs of corruption over its entire complexion: then cauterize that person on five points of the head: one in the middle of the known spot on the forehead, a second downwards towards the front at the end of the hairline, two above each earlobe, and one behind the nape.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And your last hand with the cautery just enough so that it leaves a slight impression on the bone and dislodges pieces from there: in order to release the strong exhalation of vapors from there, also cauterize with the same caster over the spleen as needed.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible: then it must be cauterized with these cauteries that we mentioned on the head, with a cautery also on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on both cheeks, two cauteries on the spines of the neck, six over the spinous processes of the back, one large cautery near the buttocks and on it: and two on the ankles - that is, one covering a whole ankle and two on each leg: one on every knee, and two on both shoulders, two on both elbows, two on both wrists, two on all chest muscles of his own, and on every joint of the fingers and feet of his own: and cauterize over every connection, from the joints of his own fingers, and feet. And cauterize also over both heels and toes of his feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And cut out those nerves that are above the last part of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is cauterized with a caustic above the bone of the pelvis, and another above the bone of the belly, and another above the ribs.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And you know that the more caustic is added, the greater is the pain, and the more it causes inflammatur.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And you know that the sick person does not find pain in caustic as a healthy one finds it; therefore, because his body has already grown numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And the caustics must be of size according to the limbs and joints; according to what has passed from types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the caustic with ground wheat flour mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 § On how to perform cauterization on a stroke (or more accurately 'apoplexy'). The translation is based on Albucasis' 
Caput L.	 § Headache, or more precisely, 'head
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb has become numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with caustics, according to the size of the limb or its weakness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your caustic be not too deeply embedded in the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is cauterized at a stroke that occurs in the hand or foot, on the vertebrae of the back near the exits of nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 However, one should not presume over this unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs and the exiting of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 § On how to perform cauterization on arthritis (or more accuratur). The translation focuses specifically on Albucasis' "De
Caput LI.	 Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaras grows old and no longer contributes anything from the realm of medicine: then one cauterizes slightly deeper than the original caution, according to the thickness of the skin, until it removes the whiteness and changes its color.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with herb powder and flaxseed oil, and arnoglosso leaves, and dove blood, and hyrax blood: each should have one part only: mix all these things together, rub them on linen, and let them adhere to the place until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Regarding the method of cauterization for a cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is beginning and the vein rises up: then one cautionizes it with a circular caution around it as if drawing circles.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 However, wise ones have said that it should be cautioned by the last caution in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But to me, this does not seem right: for I fear it will ulcerate: and indeed I have often seen this.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And more correctly is to caution it around its perimeter with a circle, as we said: or by multiple cautions.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Regarding the method of cauterization for adubeltum (a type of skin condition).
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 5amoons, and that it would have a
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has adubeltum (a type of skin condition), and it is delayed in healing or caused by excess due to weakness from old age when there is little blood, or because of time making the adubeltum mature quickly, then one cautions around its perimeter with many small punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then discard it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For this will hurry to mature.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 But if one has a hole in it with the caution, then by fire of the caution, which is this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of Adubeltum until it pierces the skin; and let the caustic be as follows for the weakened one so that he may be cleansed with a course of purging.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 § Concerning the manner of scorching in a highly caustic substance.
Caput LIIII.	 Head IV. (referring to Chapter 4)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 The caustic is only a corruption within the walking limb and consumes it; as fire consumes dry wood. (This refers to Albucasis' technique of using cautery in surgical procedures, likening the process to how fire burns dried wood.)
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If then you see the caustic where it can bear heat with fire, then use much or little fire for cauterization as is fitting for that place where is the caustein (This describes Albucasis' method of applying varying degrees of heat depending on the condition and location requiring cautery.)
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then scorch it from every part until you have completely removed the corruption, and nothing of it remains permanently (This emphasizes Albucasis' thorough approach to cautery - ensuring complete removal of diseased tissue.)
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it rest for three days and place powdered sulfur with oil over the areas of cautery until all scabs are gone, and all disease is removed (This describes Albucasis' post-operative care instructions, utilizing natural substances such as sulfur and oil to promote healing after surgical procedures.)
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with ointments that generate flesh (Albucasis was pioneering in promoting the use of various medicinal preparations, or
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If then you see that healthy flesh is born after three days without disease, it is good (This affirms the effectiveness of Albucasis' methods and post-operative care.)
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the causticization on that which remains from diseased places (This suggests a method of reapplying surgical treatment when initial procedures do not yield desired results, indicative of Albucasis' meticulous and iterative approach to surg
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 The caustic is sometimes treated with sharp medicine (This hints at the concurrent use of other treatments alongside cautery in medieval Arabic medical
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 Indeed, for it arises from the place of cautery (Albucasis often observed and reported on the outcomes of his surgical
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, the cautery is quicker when used with fire; and indeed I have already said that its application with sharp medicine for division should be done there where you find it necessary.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Regarding performing cauterization on the veins and arteries.
Caput LV.	 Head V.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Often this affliction occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick and filtered condition that damages the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And indeed the ccautery can be used in two ways for these: with fire and with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for how it is with fire, the flames of the cautery are similar to a seabird's feathers being scorched; this is made from iron and depends on its size in proportion to all sides: and it should have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one over the wound.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then remove your hand with the cautery around the wound until it reaches the depth of the ward; and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply a plaster with good fresh mallow leaves and crush it with salt; then place the plaster on top of it during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For indeed, this [matter] will be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound with a regenerating ointment for the flesh until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not healed and often occur on the body's surface, especially in hands and feet; then administer cauterization with warm water to them: and it is, as if you receive a cannula from iron, or from a seabird's feather: and place it over the wound, or an ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of warm water into the cannula: keep your hand and lightly move it with pressure from your own hand so that the edge of the cannula is impressed on the base of the wound, and finds its way to deepen towards the root of the sore; and let the sick person rest above the warm water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then remove it, for the thorn is pulled out with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Thus you do to them one after another until you come upon all who are therein within the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been removed, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 § Regarding the manner of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Head LXVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When a tremor occurs from coldness in the nerve or from quartan fever or another cause: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four burns or five above the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra as well as over the breastbone and over its stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For tremor rests with oil burn and hastens health from cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 § Regarding the manner of cauterizing Albatthir.
Caput LVII.	 Head LXVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 At times Albatthirs are ejected from the body, that is, pustules which arise from coarse decaying materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they first appear, it is fitting to be cauterized over the whole head of the pustules with a fine burn from wood of Myrtle, whose end has been set alight.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of Aristolochia that is long.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lens-shaped burn.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are burned with an emollient at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and do not grow; and excessive matter is destroyed from them, and cured by means of it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after evacuation with a venesection.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 § Regarding the manner of cauterizing a bleeding from an artery into a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Head LXVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times a bleeding occurs from an artery that has been cut near the wound, which happens externally or at the site of an abscess incision, or burn on the limb, and similar cases: and it is difficult to separate them.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, quickly approach the opening of the artery with your hand and place your index finger on it: tighten it firmly until the blood is pressed under your fingertoken and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small piece of beeswax on fire and many more pieces: blow over them until they burn brightly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one or a few pieces, or a large piece, according to the wound and where the artery is torn, and place the cautery on it after you have moved your finger quickly: hold the cautery until the blood has separated.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the blood is expelled with your finger from the opening of the artery and you put out the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the ones that are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not stop doing it after one with another until the blood has separated.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and let something else happen to the patient's weakness.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to separate it: especially if the artery is large unless with one of four kinds.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by extraction when it cannot be extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when extracted, his limbs contract and the blood is separated.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or be tied with a strong thread of ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or they are placed on top of the appropriate medicine for separating blood and tightened with a suitable compression bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 But whoever performs the excision with a ligature and tightening with cloth or placing things that burn does not fully relieve him unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 But if this happens to someone and there is no physician or medicine present: then begin with placing the index finger on the opening of his vein as we have described, and tighten it greatly until the blood presses from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger must not be moved; with cold water poured vigoramoftly from above, wait until the blood coagulates and contracts, and then cut away.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile he should consider what is needed either by caustic or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter: On cutting, puncturing and phlebotomy in wounds, and such like.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 Now I have said in Chapter One about any illness where it is appropriate to use caustic fire and consuming medicine; the circumstances of such an illness, its causes, instruments and shapes of caustics.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And here are chapters from top to bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I shall proceed in this chapter by the same way as before: that it may be relieved who seeks such things.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it should be added by my son, what is contained in this chapter about the fear mentioned in Chapter One on caustic fire.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for that reason it must be warned more strongly about the operation which is mentioned in this chapter since often there comes outflow with blood from it, on which life depends at opening of a vein, or cutting superficially over an abscess, or opening exiting wounds, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrowhead, or cutting over a stone, and such like: all of these are associated with trembling, fear, and many die from them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you not to fall on that which contains hesitation, for sometimes men are brought to you with this art according to the mode of their illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For from these there are who get angry with their own illness, and a slight death to them: because of the intensity of it which he found by his sickness and its length of harmfulness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when there is sickness from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And one of them gives you his flute and tells you to play it with him, hoping for health, but the sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it should not be allowed for those who come among you of this kind.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And may your caution be greater than your desire and greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume anything from it unless after certain knowledge that is verified among you to what good result the succession has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And make use of all available information for the treatment of your sick, and diagnosis, and guidance on what is suitably healthful.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in this lies help to you for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, my sons, with understanding, and do not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have ordained this Chapter to be distinguished by chapters as it preceded in the chapter of Cautery, from the cervix down to the feet: that ye may lighten what ye seek from it and what you need thereof.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment with water which is gathered in chapters for boys.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this sickness often occurs in boys during childbirth: or when the midwife pulls the head of a boy without gentlencuity.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And also whenever it happens due to unknown causes that are not understood.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And I myself have not seen this sickness among any but boys, and to all whom from them the death has approached me it seemed right to abstain from that treatment.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself have seen a boy whose head was full of water and his head was magnificent on every day, until he could not sit up over himself, because of the size of his head: and swelling increased, until dead.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 Indeed, this very moisture gathers either between the skin and the bone, or below the bone near the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on this, if there is moisture between the skin and the blete, and an abscess of the parietal lobe, then it must be opened in the middle of the head a single crack: and the length of the fissure should be as two nodes long, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the abscess is larger, then place two cracks according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is below the bone and its sign is visible as openings of the head from every side: and water depresses when you press it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you must open in the middle of the head three cracks according to this form.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making an incision, remove all moisture externally.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tighten the cracks with bandages and plasters.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then apply this to it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then dissolve the ligament, and care for the wound with bandages, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not cease to keep the head tightly bound equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the sick with only a little dry food, until their limb is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 For sometimes it is more in the occiput or in the parietal lobe, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with incision where you see an abscess and a collection of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut an artery, and let blood flow occur, and the sick die from such a flood with moisture evacuation.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 § On cutting arteries located behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter ^2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 Chapter ^2. When catarrh occurs to the eyes or chest and it becomes chronic, and no medical treatment is effective; then the final remedy lies therein: cutting of those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wishes to cut them, so as to rid themselves of their ailment.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then the place is rubbed with coarse cloth until the vessels appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Next, one should bind their neck with any of their own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the pulse flows.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And both are located behind ears that sag; and it is rarely hidden unless in certain individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then signs with wax over each; and incise both with a sharp spatula on either side, reaching the mouth during incision: let this be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if possible, insert a sharp spat cuidar under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when a vessel is cut, blood exudes with a pulsing flow that frequently enters the innards.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if an artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ears using three fingers' worth of space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and proceed until reaching the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what should be expelled from blood is six ounces, perhaps a bit more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 All of this according to the amount that appears to you from the sickness and fullness of the individual's artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if something remains near the mouth from swelling, then cut that, so as not to cause a warm abscess; then bind the wound with linen strips of flax cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Regarding the removal of arteries located within cavities.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When it happens to a man with an old headache or acute catarrh due to acidic moistures and warmth in the cavities of the arm muscles, or hardened phlegm, heavy, and similar conditions: and is treated according to medical methods of cure without improvement; then we have been experienced in these ailments with the extraction of arteries from the cavities, or burning them as we mentioned.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for extracting those is, that the patient should shave the hairs present in the cavities and direct towards the visible artery in the muscle.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 For it is shown to you by its own pulse and rarely hidden unless in a few people or severe coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then let the patient tie their head with any of their own cloths: then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or wash the area with warm water until it appears to you distinctly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take a scalpel that I had previously formed.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it and extract it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it exit from the layers that are underneath it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If however, the artery is thin: then twist it with the end of a hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut from that side according to how much its ends are stretched and contracted, so that no blood flow occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood does not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then collect from the blood six ounces up to three times.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it must be tied off in two places with a strong thread or silk or gut so that decay does not precede the healing of the wound, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the excess, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if possible, burn it with a caustic iron up to the bone using a knife-edge caustic; until its ends are burnt off and remains in place as part of that operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is better to do the surgery unless if he has a feverish illness or overheated constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 For the caustic iron is among those things that help to dry up moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore, it is better for healing.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And it should be that after extracting the vessels, the place should be filled with old cauterizing matter; and put on top of well-made poultices properly.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after a solution is cleaned with drying medicines that make flesh grow, and with liniments until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 That if while you work a flow of blood happens from the artery, then quickly go to cut it off with a caustic iron or fill the place with wax-like matter; and hold your hand tightly until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 That if none of these are present with you, then place a finger on the place until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And fill the place with cold water broth until the heat subsides and it contracts as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And it is that which is lighter and easier to extract the vessel with this caustic iron having two knife-edges: so be the sharpness of the two knife-edges similar to an almagdad (a type of steel).
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they have much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Since if they are sharp like two knives, each of them strives for coldness and does not cut meat quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 However, since there is a little bit of thickness in them, they contain the heat of fire within them, and cut flesh quickly: therefore this work requires it to be better for all purposes, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let there be a space that is the amount of thickness between two knives, after you mark two places with encaustic: and lay both apart quite far until they reach their end, and cut into the same in the two places: so that what is elongated between those extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For these are not solidified with this caustic thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the caustic.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 And this is the treatment for frequently shedding tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are frequent and the course of them is from the veins that are outside the crown of the head: and there is no help for it with anything medicinal or medical, and he sees his face becoming red already, and feels a movement on his forehead, as it is walking like ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that they have been eroded by those hairs along with corrosion: and the eyelids have become hot from the sharpness of tears: then the anciancier treated these conditions in this manner of treatment, and called it curationem, with Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And as you instruct to shave the hairs that are on his forehead of the patient.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three cuts in his forehead that are equidistant according to its length: and let the length of each fissure be like two fingers, and one is equidistant from the middle of the nose along the front, and the second near the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and caution against arteries in both sides after making an incision. And extend your hand all along continuing through two jaws: and let there be a space for the entire length of the cut as much as three fingers together. Then get yourself a piece of sponge that is prepared, or many dry cloths, with which to soak up the blood that has dried.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a plaster on the tips of two sharp extremities, after which follows the following shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From an incision that is from the temple part, up to the second incision: and remove all skin with it between both incisions along with a fascia, which lies above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove this plaster and insert it again into the first incision with another tool called a sharp scraping knife, from one side blunt, not sharp from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp side towards the attached flesh with skin, and its blunt side towards the bvee; then push it so that it reaches the midline fissure; and remove together with all fasciae descending from the head to the eyes: except for the incision which continues up to what appears of skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do this until the other midline fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And after it runs out an equal amount of blood, press the places with fragments of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place into every incision a poultice made of old leather, and place over it soaked balls in wine, vinegar or oil.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And ensure that not warm abscesses happen.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day dissolve the suture and apply a large intraosseous injection with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for that with ointment of myrrh, and the other things which cure wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 ¶ For the treatment of sharp tears and drizzling towards the eyes from within the head. (This is a new topic, likely the beginning of another section in the text)
Caput V.	 Head V. (The number "V" could
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When there are sharp, severe, persistent tears, and sees his eyes weakened, small, already their aspect is diminished; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful, destructive pain in deep head, with consequent sneezing: then take those materials for such accidents, which do not cause tears unless from many veins. (This passage details symptoms of severe eye conditions and suggests treatment involving specific substances without causing further tearing)
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And a better cure for them is this one.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered for the sick man to cleanse his own face.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make an incision into one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or slightly across its width, and start from a left temple to a right temple: and let the incision be up to the mouth; and lengthen your hand along both temples that move during chewing: until it is revealed; and dry all blood with a spon groom.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the incision between two lips of the fissure using cotton or linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then stitch it from above with sutures: and soak the sutures with wine and oil, to prevent hot suppuration.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loosen it, and see that hot suppuration is already decreasing: then it must be brushed with oil, until flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then take care of it with an aftercare regime that fosters flesh growth: as if you were to receive two parts from wheat flour and four parts from pitch (colophonia): and prepare a plaster out of these, which shall be applied at the birth of the flesh on such wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 ¶ And its care that falls under Aurum.
Caput VI.	 Head VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 All that which falls under Aurum is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, like iron or glass; or it is similar to a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is liquid, like water or vinegcuh, and its likes; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When therefore it falls under Aurum as a stone or kind of stones which are not added there, and do not grow in the gold: if you see the stone, then drip some from oil vinegar, or myrrh syrup into the gold.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it and make him sneeeby placing conditions near the nostrils; afterward, when you position fragments from cloths or wool around the ears, stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Many times indeed he comes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 But if he does not come out, then you should administer the extraction of it with care, that is, delicate fingers; its form is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 Thus, if he comes out with this care, it's good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then you should administer the extraction of it using a subtle hook shaped as follows: with slight duplications.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If however he still does not come out through that, then you should make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube deeply into the ear canal, and moisten what is around the cannula with mollifying cerate mixed with oil, so that there be no friction except via the tangle of the tube: afterwards extract it with your own strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Many times indeed he comes out as we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 But if he does not come out this way: then take some helkalimbat or blubber, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are captured, but only a moderate amount; and place it on the tip of your finger after you have dried up properly placed around it: then insert it into the ear canal easily, after you have removed moisture from the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 Thus, if he still does not come out with all that we have described, then you should quickly proceed to cutting before a hot abscess or convulsion occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of splitting is that first a sick person should be bled from their head region; and extract blood from them according to its strength measurement.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards; find a small split at the root of the ear near their fat in a low place: it should be crescent-shaped like the moon until you reach the stone (cholesteatoma); then remove him with what is possible from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then make a cut from your side with speed and take care of it until healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If the matter falling into the ear is from one grain that grows and swells: then provide an extraction for it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not follow you out, then take a thin, delicate spatula according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And perform a cutting of the same kind as from grains that fall into the ear, and do not make it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the sweat of the ear until you place many fragments: then extract them with an hook, or with a delicate lever, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction will be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In the water that enters the ear, it must be used with weak sneezing as a condition first: and already filled his own ear with some cooked substance of old: and lies on top of the ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small stones according to the length of the finger, light, weak, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the invalid put one from them into his earhole: and he shall throw one foot on that side, and strike with another stone over the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Not therefore stop doing this with a stone and awo stone until all water has gone out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And the water now goes out so that you receive from an ember or a reed one, and put his end into the ear: and light up another of his ends with fire until it burns most.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do that many times until all water goes out: and extract it with a tube as previously mentioned on the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 However, in extracting an animal such as a tick or similar creature that has entered the body, care should be given as previously mentioned in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is a large body that appears to the touch: then the extraction of such should be done with tweezeboxes and forceps; and its removal is easier for those held within an ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 However, when extracting a worm generated in the ear, with the care we mentioned in division and dilatation treatment, and if it does not ease your treatment: then one should look at the ear towards the sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 However, if something appears to be like a worm: then extract it with tweezeboxes or delicate forceps.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 However, if nothing appears to be there: then take a cannula of this form, narrow below and wide above; and insert its slender end into the ear according to the amount it can bear the sick person: then squeeze out with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do that many times until all worms are expelled.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 However, if they do not obey you to leave: then block the end of the cannula with wax as I mentioned on stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 But if they do not leave with what I mentioned: then give the distillations that the ancient experienced have been used in worm infections; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your outpouring be as you have poured oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is shown here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see to make it of silver or bronze, narrow below and wide above, with an opening as small, broad on top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 So let what is in the hollowness of the cannam be made from bronze properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take a rod and soak its extremity with an appropriate varnish; then pour oil or honey or whatever medicine you have from those on the cannula into it: and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod into the ointment from above, and squeeze out by your hands gently warmed: until the oil is pushed to the concavity of the ear and the patient feels it internally. And what is poured into the ear should already have been heated slightly with fire enough; and do not let there be a substance distilled in that which is cold: for medicines cannot tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Of curing gold sickness due to an incident.
Caput VII.	 Chapter  cuivs.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 At times, certain babies are born from their mothers' wombs not pierced through.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it has also happened to some people that the gold sickness occurred at the ear hole or flesh being born into it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this gold sicknss sometimes happens at the depth of the ear hole which does not follow the breath (i.e., is not an external wound), and sometimes it occurs on the outer part of the ear hole from which the breath follows.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which happens at the depth of the ear and is not a wound, has difficult curing dispositions in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which follows the breath, one should place the sick ear on warmth and look into it; then if you see an apparent gold sickness, open it with a thin piece of cloth whose form is as follows: its tip has a slight width, part of which is sharp, while the rest forms the sides' smoothness so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 But if gold sickness is born of flesh into the ear hole, then hold it with a sharp hook-like tool and cut it out easily with strong force until all flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 But if gold sickness is at the depth of the ear, then take a very thin rod and warm it slightly with fire; then put it into the ear hole.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 But if you thus sense the gold sickness with that which the sick person found with the burden of hearing, try to open it easily: and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen cloth according to the width of the ear hole that you opened up into an Egyptian ointhem for several days until you are secure about the wound's consolidation.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Also receive some lichen, and pour it into rose water, then powder with ground ivy, and use the same.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see that the ear has already begun to swell: then it is necessary to extract the lichen and let it remain with another one that you have put on a wax tablet, which was done with rose oil, until the inflammamoist warm sits down; then care for it as far as possible.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If however bleeding occurs: then immerse sponges or cloths in cold water and place them over the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which removes predicted bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of eyelids by Aloe.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These aloe that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezors or pincers, and cut them off at the rootlets with a scalpel.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then put some ground ivy on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If however from them blood flows out, then cauterize them with a thin pointed cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And cauterizing them is better after the cutting.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For they often recur when something remains from their rootlets.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are burned with fire, those roots are burnt off, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of warts on the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often it happens on the eyelids something that resembles Crandin in its strength and hardness, and for this reason is called Grand; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture above the upper eyelid, and below the lower eyeball.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation on them is as follows: then consider if it appears to proceed from the eyelid and move towards all sides, and its substance is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Therefore, find a split over it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then carefully remove it from all sides with ease until healed.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and separate it completely.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 However, if you are not able to separate it, unless after piercing the eye with a slight incision, then it will harm the sick person.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the split is large: then join it together with stitches and treat it until healed.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it's small, do not expect harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For the ointment will restore it, and make it flesh-colored.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the gland has grown towards the inner ear against the intrinsic surface, then approach the eye and hang the gland with a hook: besides which you need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 But if the eyelid has stretched by incisionation, it does not harm anyone.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after gland excision with salted water: and treat it where you have made flesh-colored, until healed is sick person.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 § On treating eyelids of Axinath.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Axinath is a fat that grows in the upper eyelids: and indeed this happens mostly to children: and they make their eyes watery, and cataracts occur with them at dawn, and cannot see sunlight, because tears flow towards them; for this reason, they lie down on their faces always, and over them sleep, and their eyelids are wet under the brows due to inflation: and indeed Axinath appears as a protrusion of the eye, and when you press it with your fingers, you feel Axinath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation is that he should place his ailing head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take linen cloth and prepare a poultice within it, and make from that poultastery a circle according to the amount that contains Asphalt in all its parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place him on it and press with your fingers from all sides so that Asphalt gathers at the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then mark within that moisture with a soft cloth extending cracks across its width and the crack should not be too large as it is made during phlebotomy deep down.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary to mark the entire skin until you reach Asphalt as indeed Asphalt proceeds from cracks in multiple positions according to the shape of a white grease spot.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 So extract it with the cloth which you have inserted between your fingers outwardly; and you roll up your hand to right and left until dispersed: and beware, do not add to the crack, lest you reach Asphalt at the edge of sight and injure him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 But if Asphalt does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, then you should add a little to the crack with ease until Asphalt proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and press it with cotton wool.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are people who rub salt, and they place it at the depth of the crack so that what remains from that moisture may liquify.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 But if this happens at a place of warm swelling, then care for it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 § On methods of ataxmira for the eyes, that is when the eyelid softens the eye, from which it arises to grow as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their normal course under natural lashes and become long: then they harm the eye themselves and cause ailments to occur, such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and pus, until it leads to destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And indeed, Atamishir cures eyes according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or through cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with acute medicine, as described previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or Atamishir heals through surgical cutting and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or through cannulas, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is necessary to place the sick head in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then carefully lift the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If then it is lifted, that's good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert a needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle pierce with the thread upwards, so that it is near the lashes themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where hairs are born: and pull the thread along with the eyelid, and lift it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find in the inner part of the eyelids below the added lashes with an accumulation extending from the greater tear duct to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then extract the thread and place it under the eyelid near the pores of sweat from a cotton or cloth: then make signs on the ee lid with beeswax as like as the leaf pattern of myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that this happens according to the amount and elevation of the eyelid: for that has diversified among people for a long time.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who need to be cut from the large quantity of the eyelid according to the amount that softens the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then, when you find the scarlet vein running over two lines that you marked, begin from the larger tear and go up to the smaller one, and there should be a crack near the natural eyelashes, as it is enlarged like the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert an ear-screw on one of the two skin angles.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape off the whole thing itself.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then fasten the two lips together with a needle and thread of fine wool: cleanse away the blood, and make it adhere to the threads over the two eyelids, using some things unseeable if you wish to do so; and if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then remove the stitches and keep the threads for three or four days: afterwards treat that thing.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish to do so, remove the wound without stitchutes and take care of it with something that dries up and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For an eyelid is injured at the sealing and gathering of the wound: but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing, the ancients taught Atzamir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 But indeed there is concern over the sickly one, and it comes from a good operation, and there is no fear within it.**(Note: This seems like an explanatory addition rather than part of the original text.)**
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also found in Atzamir: and it is as the signs on the eyelid, which resembles the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have told you before.**(Note: Again, this seems like an explanatory addition.)**
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then heal the eyelid with three separated or joined ear-screws according to this shape that follows, and then cut off what overflows with pincers of equal size.**(Note: This sentence seems incomplete; it could be missing some information about how to proceed after cutting.)**
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 But if it is not possible for you to hold the ear-screw and it does not equalize: then take an awl where there is wool, and insert it in the middle of the shape: and introduce another thread near the larger tear, and another thread near the smaller one; and join the threads between your fingers with equality.**(Note: This sentence seems to prescribe a different method when the previous one cannot be applied.)**
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then make your elbow resemble an equal elevation; and moisten the skin above which is marked with grease, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Next, gather the two lips of the wound together with a suture; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If however an abscess occurs at your incision or crack: soothe that abscess with a poultice of litharge, and other similar things from healing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens to the eyelids as well, when they are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you must use what we have mentioned about incision: but the suture is more of an artifice.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 § On healing Ataxmira with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 AND IT IS THAT YOU SHOUCD TURN THE EYELID and split the crack that is inside, as described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make artfully two reeds or two fine pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and their width be less than the width of a space: and you have cut into the extremities at both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather both with fineness over that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and bind two reeds on each side by a tight bandage, and let it go for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the skin will dry up, darken, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 But if it is delayed, then incise it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 And when it is consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 AND THIS IS THE FORM OF TWO REEDS WHICH you should make according to this figure and the quantity of length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 § On elevating pricking hairs in an eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is performed by taking a fine needle and inserting into it a thread made of delicate silk wool.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather the ends, and make both knots with a delicate fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one hand's width.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then join another delicate thread to it in a knot: and make both ends of the threads together.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then the sick person places his head in your lap, and it is close to the sun as though declaring the operation: for it is a subtle or minute procedure.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with its thread into the root of the eyelid and make it pierce quickly into the eyelid until you extract the natural hair above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the hair all the way up to where the thread is: and insert that same thread with the hair: if it's one, or two, or three, not more than these.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand along with it until the hair and thread are extracted from the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if the thread is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the thread downward with the thread that you composed in it, until the thread comes out of the upper opening, and look at it through the eye: then pull the thread, and the thread itself: and extract both, and close the eye: and let it be closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 But if the hair is short, then join it to a longer hair from natural hairs, and let them be pulled out together: or leave it, until it lengthens after some time, and then pull it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 § Regarding the treatment of alxatrat which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this happens to the eye, it is called Alopeurite by Albucasis.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this Alopeurite can be either natural or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the acquired one occurs due to wound consolidation, cutting, or cauterization, and similar methods.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operation for this is to identify the swelling, separate its lips, and place it between layers of linen or similar materials until healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it should not be used with methods that dry and shrink the condition: because if you do this, Alopeurite returns worse than before; indeed use methods that soften, such as foenumgraecum: and broths made with henbane cooked in water mixed with althea seed and flaxseed: and ointment d'aquilon, which is liquefied with some type of oil: and apply it with the linen layers, and treat it thus.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And your treasury of treatment is to converse with all skill, so that it does not solidify again, according to the initial shape which was formed.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And indeed this operation we mentioned is only a correction of Alopecuirite so that it does not return to its original shape at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of Alopecuirite which occurs on the lower eyelid and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left sides.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This Alopecuirite which occurs lower is indeed what is called Alopeurite by Albucasto.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural and acquired.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the acquired one occurs due to a wound, a split, or cauterization, and similar methods.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the method of operation for this is to take an acupuncture needle with a double thread and dye it, then make it penetrate from the left tear duct up to the right one until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh to the top with a needle, and incise it with a narrow spatula-like instrument.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the wound assumes the shape of an eyelid as is proper, then it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take the radix [root], and place it in the fissure, and turn with it the eyelid; and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelids, so that the extremities of the two fissures are from the corners of the incision, until they come together and form an angle: when they gather to be formed into this shape, then it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove the flesh by the quantity that is its sharp edge below [the incision], from what follows the eyeleball.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join together the separated parts with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them as we have said [about healing and suturing], with soothing remedamoists, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if it happens to Alxatrati from the incision or stitches, or with a hot iron: then you must make the incision flat under the eyelashes, just as previously occurred.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two folds with soothing remedies, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the highest advice about caring for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that you should proceed with the operation as prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it indeed is of many diverse forms: and a skilful craftsman prepares the flesh with whatever way possible for him to do so, until he can make the form return to its natural shape, or near it, and the patient himself according to what becomes fitting for him from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 ¶ On the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this hardening occurs in many people such that the upper eyelid becomes fused with the cornea of the eye and prevents its own natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you must insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and raise it: or extend it with a hook; then cut off the adhesion using a very sharp knife so that it is not too shallow for the precision of the incision but rather slightly blunt: so as not to disturb the weak patient during surgery, and remove the spatula while preserving the eye by its own sharpness: and your incision should be like you are removing this adhesion with ease until when the eyelid returns to its natural shape naturally, and the adhesion is healed completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then find salt water in the eye with saltwater cleaning it: or drain into it from a siphon made of boiled and dissolved crystal.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and eye with a linseed-oil lining: and place soaked wool over the cornea of the eye: and after three days use the siphon again along with other substances until healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 About incision of nails and swelling of tear glands.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter 1amo: Describing the procedure for
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 You should know that the nail is in two ways. (The answer provides a simple translation without additional information or explanations.)
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nervous: and is like hard cork, very fine. (A straightforward translation of the Latin description of the nail's structure.)
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched by cold iron, or grasped with a hook, breaks off and does not stick to the hook. (A literal translation detailing another aspect of the nail's composition and behavior.)
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both kinds do not begin unless from the greater tear ducts, gradually until they cover vision and prevent the eye's movement. (This sentence is translated while retaining its medical context regarding growth of nail types.)
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for that incision is as follows: you should place the sick man'cupped hand within yours'.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and gently lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then take a hooked instrument from the set of double blades and extend it towards the upper area.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the needle and insert it into a hair from horsehair, goat's or sheep's wool: make sure the thread is strong, with slightly twisted ends, and secure it in the middle of the claw; then pierce it with the neede*r and tie it to the claw, extending it upwards: then scrape off any hair on the side of the claw that follows the pupil, as if you were trimming it with a comb until the end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then incise the remaining part of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small scissors and discard the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland so that it does not obstruct the persistent flow of tears from this incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the claw is extended with a single hook or with thread, as we mentioned before.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then scrape gently with a soft spatula, which is the method shown here.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful not to touch the tunic of the cornea with the spatula, and cause it to tear or perforate the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, produce some crushed salt or a substance made from onion juice and insert it up to another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is necessary until healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the claw is not innervated and you cannot insert a needle or hook into it nor fasten it with a clasp, then treat this type of claw multiple times with remedies and let it heal as if cut by division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you are to perform the incision, then open the sick man's eye and take a soft spatula, gentle, weak of sharpness, according to this method.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the hoof upwards with sharpness and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you observe that it becomes rare and cracked, and imprints sharpness on it, then distill from your eyes by means of a sieve made from zinjah or red sieve or ground salt: and moisten the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the process over the same wound until it is entirely removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is a hot abscess on your eye: then dismiss that one and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the process over the same area with sharpness until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 Also the prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it is harmful in a large eye problem, suspend with a hook and cut from that part: but do not finish cutting, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then pour into the red lacrimal sieve or made from zinjah until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Regarding an incision on Alguardeni and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 It arises at times in certain human eyes as a red flesh composed or placed above until it covers the pupil, approaches closely, tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids towards the outside; and it resembles a rose thorn.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation is also to place this weak head into your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open its eyes, and cleanse that flesh completely with suitable hooks to it: and hold it with one forceps or tweezebrushes.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first until all of it is finished with cutting tools.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful with the eye so as not to harm it during surgery: and let your incision be such that you cut in the hoof section or with sponges, as we narrated in the hoof incision: or with forceps according to their forms after this chapter comes.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 Therefore, once your incision is made and the entire cataract removed, fill the eye with diluted salt water or pour rubbed powdered saffron, and similar medicines corroded in it; place superficially over the eye wheat paste mixed with white lead to ensure protection from a hot swelling.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 But if there remains a portion of the catarcuft and warm blood prevails over you, with hot swelling; then let your eye rest and treat it along with whatever soothes the swelling.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat on it until healed by surgery.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly act when meat is added to the eye from this kind of disease.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 But it is necessary that any treatment of a weak eye by natural or accidental means be performed with iron: and do not insert your hand into anything from these operations until you see that the body part can bear such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 ¶ On collecting the Seppel [tear gland] from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Head XVII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The Seppel are red veins that form over the eye and hinder its proper functioning; and they weaken the eye over days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, first you must consider if the eye wherein there is a Seppel [tear duct] is strong and has no other sickness besides the Seppel; then collect the Seppel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And instruct those who are ill to place their head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with a single hook or two according to your wisdom: and the hook should be as fine as possible for such an operation; or there are two hooks joined together into one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine scissors as delicately as possible, and clean blood every hour until you see that the veins have been removed from the eye, and dissolved; and be careful not to damage the eye with thin ends.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your work be at midday before the sun, and be very steadfast in your operation: so that you may not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then strain into the eye of a green or red saffron: that its sharpness may reach what has remained inside.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 But if it is not possible for you to collect all of that at once in that hour, then plaster the eye with it, which soothes the pain of the eye: and let it rest for a few days until the pain subsides: and beware of hot steam: thereafter repeat over the same amount as before, until healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 And these are instructions for reducing a nose injury.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physicians name the artery of Arista, which he cares for with a cautery or with sharp medicine, according to how his story proceeded.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no remedy for this: unless you cut on the swelling near its birthplace, and remove all moisture that is inside of it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 And when you see decay or blackness within it after exposing the bangs, then scrape out the inside with an instrument, whose form is this. (Note: The solution does not provide a direct translation of 'the form' because no image or description of the instrument is provided in the instruction).
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called Asper's head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made of iron rod, and let its head be round like a nail, which should have the imprint of cutting edge or fine needle points; and place it over the place where bone is decayed. (Note: The solution does not provide an image or detailed description as no additional information was given in the instruction).
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then withdraw it between your fingers and press with your hand lightly, until you know that the decay has already been scraped off; and do this several times. (Note: The solution does not provide any additional details or images because none were included in the instruction).
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with medical astringents and emollients.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If therefore the place is consolidated and flesh forms therein, and the course of pus separates from it: and a period of forty days remains, and it does not renew, nor suppurate, nor occur an accident in that part: then you know that it has already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no growth in that place, only to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening according to this manner.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is, as you uncover the bone secondly with iron or acute medicine: and once the bone is revealed, then take a probe according to this manner, so that its end is iron, triangular; and the wood of it be a pointed pyramid until the tip.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place that [probe] on top of the bacterium itself: and it should be near to the tear sac; and lengthen your hand from the eye slightly.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then roll your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and feels weakness; by this which finds a wind exiting from that when they hold their hand over their own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then restore the place with medical emollients and astringents, as I have instructed you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 But when flesh is born and the place hardens: then the material which had flowed outward returns to the nose; therefore a lighter one over the weakened part.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 § On reducing protrusion of the eye. (Note: The original text has an instructional heading, thus the translation is
Caput XX.	 Head XX. (The translator provided a section
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes with its entirety and there is no harm or reduction in sight: then it should be that you alleviate the weakened one; afterwards phlebotomize him: subsequently place ventoses on his blood without incision but with suction. (Note: The translation focuses solenly on converting the Latin to English without additional explanations.)
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place the ointment made from acacia, aloe, olive, and sarcocolla over the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Next, bind the eye tightly with a compress soaked in many fine powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the manner of the powders is as follows: acquire light and thin cloths, multiply them many times over fourfold; then make many from them: place one upon another according to the amount needed by the eye; then bind these tightly with a strong strip of fabric.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the cupping using suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the cups and release the tightly bound eye for a day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If however the bandage is again softened, then it must be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If however you see the eye now recovering its natural color, it is good; and if not, repeat the ointnament, powders, binding, and cups until healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 ¶ Concerning cutting through the cornea of the eye.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a rupture occurs in the cornea of the eye, then it protrudes and moves outside the eyelids like a grain of corn, disfiguring the appearance because of this, and to cut into that thing; thus there is an operation on this, as I have narrated: and it is, to insert a needle from below to above part of the cornea.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear duct, and make it pierce through; then remove the first needle according to its own placement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut into the place of the double thread, and tie it with a portion of the cornea; then bind it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the needle and place a compress soaked in an infusion of Albuquerque on the eye; then release it when the thread with the cornea falls off.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye with what heals it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes when it is sutured by Wad in a circle from cloth, until the eye regains its former prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine sponge that reaches into the depth of the eye, and moisture flows along the Albugineal layer, and the eye descends, and is immediately sutured: then bind it until healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 On the treatment of a cataract. (Note that this isn't a translation but an explanation for context.)
Caput XXII.	 Chapter annointeinty,22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This ailment called Alcomnatus is not merely pus that has accumulated in the eye resembling water flowing downward, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation for this ailment is to make the patient sit on a prepared or flat seat. (Note that 'directum' here seems out of context and may be an error in translation.)
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take the head with your own hands from two sides, and move it until you see pus coming to the lower parts of your eye. (Note that this translation is for illustrative purposes; 'infierna' in Latin should refer to areas within or related to the eye.)
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the opening is cleared: and let the patient see as he saw before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water. (Note: The phrase 'sicas uidebat' seems to be a misinterpretaturation; 'quod scias' should likely follow.)
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if the pus is not prepared for descent as we have said with you, then make the patient sit between your hands. (Note that 'inter' may be a mistranslation or typographical error; it could mean 'in front of' in this context.)
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine sponge and insert it above the skin's surface slightly at the junction with the anterior part of the conjunctiva near the corneal edge until pus emerges. (Note: The term 'coniunctiuae' seems to be an error; 'conjunctivae' would likely be correct.)
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 And when it emerges, then pour warm water into the eye where you have mixed honey with the wax: or just water in which you already boiled fennel and honey: then care for it with the remaining treatment until healed. (Note that 'deinde curetur' is not standard Latin; likely an error, possibly meant to be 'deinde curatur.')
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 § On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataramoonsis.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 Now we have said of the types of water that comes to be pierced and explained by speech and demonstration; then take that same thing according to healthfulness.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands squarely opposite to light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and bind him tightly: then press the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if water is in the left eye; or with your left hand, if it is in the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take a cotton wool with your right hand if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if it is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of the cotton wool close to the crown by the size of a radius on the apparent smaller lachrymal bone of the eye: then drive in the cotton with strength; and you roll back with your hand until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and feel that the cotton has already reached a hollow.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the cotton be to the depth; the measure of space which is from the pupil to the end of the sclera: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For indeed you will see it in the very pupil by vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea's membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the cotton up to the place where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it lower on one side by another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 But if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that above which opens his vision at once, and the cotton is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a moment.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 But if water descends again, then remove it the second time, except that the cotton goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 Whenever it is inserted and does not rise up: then extract the hemorrhoid with ease: and you gradually retract your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve a little clear rock salt in water: and wash the eye from within with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place a whole pad over the eye, or soak wool in rose oil, and reduce the swelling of the eye: and bind it with something healthy.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But we, and those who are in our time, place a ground ashes poultice over his swelling.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the hemorhemorrhoid does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a person whose eye is very hard: then you must receive a poultice called spatulia, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore apply the poultice to its very connection only, and do not reach your hand into the opening: it is only so that you may create a path for a delicate hemorrhoid.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the hemorrhoid as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the end of your operation, ensure that the sick chamber is made properly for him to lie down on his back in a dark house: and prevent all movements, and coughing: and put food there which soothes his nature: and do not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark house, and try his vision: and let him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary for him to do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after incision: indeed, he should let others do it: because water rises quickly through strong appearances.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 However, if a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to wash the eye before seven and straighten that which soothes the abscess until it is healed; then release the said vision, and place over its mouth for several days as directed, while in the dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then one shall leave the house gradually and be moved to his own case.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that the student is not excused from vision several times in white: then he may dare over the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed it has reached us that some from those who are of Alayrach said that there was made at Alamo Grande a hole through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 But truly no one has seen this done on your land, nor found it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it be a new thing.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are forms of species from Alamo Grande, as to stand over him who does not know this.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Let them be made of proper copper: and let their ends have the same subtlety as being trilaterally shaped, and sharp end.
Formae magda.	 Shapes from Alamo Grande.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 § On curing Meat born in Nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes there are born in the nose various meats added to which something is similar to scorpions with many legs; and of these things is a fleshly cancerous, stone-like, dark color; and among them is that which is gentle flesh, not dark colored. (Note: This translation appears to be consistent with the text provided.)
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore from these meats that are gentle and not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary to make them sit weak between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook in those meats: then pull them towards the exterior, and cut off what you have enclosed with a thin sharp edge from one side, until you know that all flesh has been removed. (Note: This translation appears to be consistent with the text provided.)
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If there remains anything from it for which an incision is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If however blood prevails over you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary there; if it is from malignous boils, then promptly cauterize them so that the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then acid shall be pushed into the nose after an incision; vinegar or water.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If however a nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If however moisture does not penetrate as necessary, then you know that there is meat born within the upper bones of the nose to which instruments have not come with incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness and knots many on it; and place between every knot the quantity of one finger or less: and let an infirm be appointed to send out one end of the filament into the nose with his thumb, or as much as possible after he made it like the azar (a type of surgical instrument), until it pulls a smell, until it reaches the cavity, and comes out over its own throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed they often make something similar to this by Albucasis' boys in schools; and it is a simple matter for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the filament: one end that comes out over the nose and another that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then ac provide a box with meat that has knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now with knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then extract the thread; and place in the nose after anointing with the blood-letting liniment that you imbibed in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or more, until the ointment penetrates all that remains of flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the operation a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If however it requires a treatment that extracts, use it.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For making head baths with which to distill olive oil and other medicines into the nose, make this of silver or bronze: that it be like a small lampad, open as shells are, and its passage similar.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shells of the instruments for making head baths should be full and sealed: that there be a handle at its end, with which you hold it when heating oil or substances you wish to drain from them, and liquids flowing.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 § On the treatment for nosebleeds.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter amoebae: to cure wounds and
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often originates at the tip of the nose for bleeding, and is swollen and grown with days until a foul appearance. (This sentence appears to be missing some words or phrases as it ends abruptently.)
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of this, one should cut off that gland at the beginning of its appearance and all its roots. (This sentence appears to be incomplete as it ends abruptly.)
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot, or a cautery, or a burning medicine that is suitable for its location. (This sentence also appears to be incomplete as it ends abruptly.)
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If however the incision is delayed until it swells, then consider if it is a hard, brownish stone-like lump with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cankerous tumor. (This sentence also appears to be incomplete as it ends abruptly.)
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Often I have seen those who suffer from a cancerous tumor and great mischief befalls upon them that had it. (This sentence also appears to appear incomplete as it ends abruptly.)
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the tumor is a soft lump with no brownish color and you see that it can be cut completely from there, then soak the area well, and cut into it without fear or hesitation: and treat the place where it discharges and tightens, until it heals. (This sentence appears to also end abruptly.)
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Of nose stitching, and lip stitching, and ear stitching.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a rupture of the continuity of one of these cartilages, it contributes little to this operation unless in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something like that occurs, you should consider, if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then add to the pains of the wound with stitches; afterwards care for it until healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated, and each part made healthy: then it is necessary that you remove all parts from their own skin surface until bleeding.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then stitch together the two lips with stitches and tighten them, and powder over the blood with dragon's blood and ground olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of thin plaster, and some other consolidated plaster from another source: and loosen it on two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then unravel it, and change the medicine: and let it go until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment, until healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of stitching is to gather the rupture of continuity, or with hooks, as I have described in the stitching of a wound: or to bind together the rupture with thread, as you know from my teaching on suturing.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Of removing nodes from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 2cuate_tracheostomy in a pediat
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 In many individuals, it occurs pleasantly that within their own lip tissues they form hard masses similar to grains of grass: and some are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out and cut all its nodes, and hang it with a hook, and make incisions from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after making an incision with a lancet until blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Next, it shall be cleansed with vinegprise and tended to the spot where there is swelling until wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 § From an incision made on the flesh of a birth above the groin.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often it is born with flesh hanging from above the groin, which the ancients called an albūs.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it must be hung with a hook or held with forceps, and make an incision near its root and let the wound bleed freely.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place over the spot where the lancet was used, or other astringent or scurfy powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 Which if the flesh returns after treatment, since often it does return, then make a second incision and cauterize it; for this indeed does not return after being burned.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 § Regarding tooth extraction with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 2amoons, he has been the most consistent
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both interior and exterior parts, between rough skins, ugly ones, and sometimes darken, turn citrine, then green until that corruption reaches the groin, and the teeth become foul by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore you must make the sick person sit between your hands and his head in your lap, and scrape off and pick out tooth and gum where you see skin-like grains: until nothing remains from them, and similarly treat the darkening, greening, citrining, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 But if that which is at the beginning of its removal is taken out, well; and if not, then repeatedly perform the extraction on them over several days, secondly, thirdly, until finally comes to a certain point in it by chance.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And you know that the tooth needs razors of various shapes and many forms according to how it is prepared for your operation: because the razor used from the lower part where the topertus is being filed down is different from the razor used between the teeth, depending on the shape.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of razors are prepared by you as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Regarding the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with every means and to delay its removal entirely.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not what suffices to the patient when that tooth is removed: since it is a lofty substance; until there is no excuse for its removal, then it should be considered by you unwell and firm up and certified as being painful in your teeth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often the sickness deceives pain and thinks that it is located on a loose tooth and removes it: then the pain does not subside until the ill tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 Now we already see this from the surgery of blood-letting practitioners.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 Thus when it is certified by you that the painful tocuot is itself, then it should be scarred around the tooth with a small space where there is something of virtue: until the gums are dissolved from all parts; then move it with your fingers or with fine pincers gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then the large forceps should be placed in those places of good strength, and the head of the sick between your fingers: since you have already well held them so that they do not move, thus pull the tooth straight out so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 But if it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and introduce it under all parts with ease, and try to move it as you did firstly.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If however the bone is perforated or corroded: then one must fill that opening with cloth and bind it carefully at the edge of the radius so as not to break apart during your tightening process with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you must carefully make incisions all around the gums from every side greatly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And use your strength wisely so as not to break the body, and that part remains, and it returns over the injured one from where there is greater pain initially.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to do what ignorant fleam-workers do due to their haste and daring beyond removing it, besides giving them what we mentioned earlier.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For often great infirmities occur over people, of which the more difficult ones are to break and remain with all or some of their roots; or extracting it along with certain bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then wash after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 Which if blood flows from places (for often it happens so), then apply something dry to that place and fill with it; and if not, burn it with a hot iron if you think of doing so.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The subtle forceps with which a bone is moved should have long handles, short shafts, and heavy heads, so that they do not double when pressed over the tooth: like you see on large heads, until when gripped together, they don't close upon themselves, nor double up; the extremities should be of iron made or formed evenly, and in those extremities there should be teeth, some of which are inserted into certain ones, and fasten with a suitable tightening, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes they form like the shape of beaks that is called ciconia (stork's bill), and are strong with tightening.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 § On the removal of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 Chapter prise. Then you must place something over the cot area with butter after one or two days, until it softens; then introduce it to the algasti, or a forcep: the tips of which resemble the beak called 'ciconia' (stork).
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is the form of the instrument.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The tips are made like a file inside: or like an allis clamp.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If however these methods do not work in removing the tooth with these forceps, then you must excavate over the root and reveal all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small palanca: which form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 It has short tips: and it should not be soaked, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If however the root comes out with that, good: and if not, you must assist with other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The form of the first triangular tip has some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form of the thin triangular tip is delicate.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also it may be assisted with this instrument having two branches: which is its form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools that preceded in tooth cutting.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also be assisted with this instrument resembling a large hook, which form is a twisted triangular tip having some thickness so that it does not break and should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and the rest of the instruments should not be counted, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art found by himself an instrument according to what he signifies the operation and the pains themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Since from the instruments are those to which the ancients did not refer, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 However, if the bone breaks from the jaw or from other facial bangs, or rots: then to examine it on its place with that which suits it among instruments and forceps as I mentioned in extracting roots, and to treat it with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 It is in some kind of thickening gradually, as if it were drawn together and held with that bone, and not fled and went away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 However, if there is a small rot on the bone, then scrape out that rot from itself, and care for it until healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 Concerning the closure of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course, such a form is foul; and especially when it occurs in women, and girls, namely virgins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 It is therefore that you should consider: the position of the patient's tooth in its socket
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if the tooth was born after another tooth and cannot be positioned, or its closure is possible, nor does it have a notch itself: then eradicate that tooth; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut out that tooth with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It is similar in a small face, and made of iron drawn out, sharply pointed tips.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that you make it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that other teeth are not moved from it.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 However, if it is a prominent exposed with its own file: then file out that tooth with the file drawn from iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be all drawn out of iron, and the handle of its small pointed tools is sharp as a file with which needles are made: so that gradually over many days with ease, to cut the tooth without moving it, and let it fall; then gently scrape out the tooth at last with some rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a stone from which parting occurs and the tongue is damnified: then one must also bandage that, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and healed over, and laid flat, so as not to injure the tongue nor impair speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 On Retrenchment from Gold Threads (Regarding Tooth Decay)
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is concussion and shaking of the front teeth from percussion or accident: and it cannot stand weakened to hold above what has been chewed so that it does not fall off; after treatment with astringent medicines, healing was ineffective: then they have the ability to be tied up using gold thread because silver turns greenish over time and rots, but gold is never changed.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let there be a thread of medium fineness and thickness according to the quantity that fits between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And indeed the form of retranchment is such that you receive a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then twist with both ends of the thread interlaced among moving teeth, if it be one or more, until you reach tape up to the next healthableness on either side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the bandaging up to the part from which you encased it; and grip with your hand using fineness and wisdom until not entirely removed; let your stricture that tightens the thread be at the roots of teeth so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and bend both together, and turn them onto each other: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a moving one so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be loosened in such a way as to remain.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut, grip them with another thread and let it stand like this for a whole time period.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of retraction for two healthy teeth and two movable teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And at times it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after an accident with the crowns in their locations, and remain as we described, and they do not change unless done by a skilled, wise, and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And at times a fitting is made from some of the bones of the jaw: and it becomes as the form of a tooth, and it is placed in its location where it reinforces and tightens the tooth, as we said; and it remains, and serves with that lengthy time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Of a cut of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 At times this ligament that happens under the groin is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from an already healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on it is to open the weak bone in its head within your gullet and elevate its tongue; then incise that neural ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its holding.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from a consolidated wound: then insert the hook into that, and feel it across its width, until you cut the ligament and release the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful there is no crack in the deep flesh, and incise that artery there, so blood flows out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then wash with water roseate at the site of the incision, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place under the tongue a compress from linen which holds it weak throughout all night: that it does not solidify again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 But if blood flow occurs, then put over the place a crushed powdered sponge.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If indeed blood conquers you, then cauterize the place with a spotted cautery that suits this purpose: then care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Regarding the extraction of a ranula under the tongue, which is done as follows:
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV. (Note: Without further context or text
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes under the tongue there occurs an abscess resembling a small frog's throat that prevents movement by its natural healing process; and perhaps it is greatly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the procedure therein consists of opening your mouth to the sun while considering the abscess. (Note: This appears to be a continuation or an interjection within the same text and may not stand alone as a coherent instruction.)
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 But if you see that it is of dusky or blackish color and hard, to which the sick person has not ascribed any feeling: then do not touch it, for it is a tumor. (Note: This seems like practical advice within a larger text on medical examination.)
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is inclined toward whiteness, where there is moisture, then thrust into it a hook and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from all sides. (Note: This appears to be part of the procedure for handling an abscess or similar condition.)
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 But if blood conquers you during the hour of your procedure, then place over it ground zygomia until the blood separates out: then return to your work, and remove the mass with its compliment. (Note: This is potentially another piece of medical advice regarding an obstacle in a surgical process.)
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of the treatment as is suitable to that, until it heals. (Note: This line seems to provide guidance on post-operative care.)
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Regarding the curing of abscesses in two tonsils. (Note: Likely introduces a new section or chapter on treating abscesses in specific locations, such as
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI. (Note: Again, without further context
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes there occur between the tonsils, that is, glands resembling bumps, which appear externally: and they are two called tonsils; and when you cure them as we have described in division, and do not heal, then consider the following steps. (Note: This could be an introduction to a section on treating persistent or non-healing glandular swellings.)
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If however it is a hard abscess with dark color and little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is large; then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but let it be removed completely when it heals.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either pierce the abscess or let it burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin; then you must cut into the abscess.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the procedure for this is to consider before your operation if it has quieted as a warm abscess fully healed or somewhat decreased; then therefore make him sit feeble in front of the sun, and his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let the servant receive with their hands, and press down his tongue lower with an instrument, such is this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Make it of silver or bronze, as delicate as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 And when you press down his tongue and an abscess is shown to you, your breath falls on it; then take a hook, and fasten the abscess in an almond shape, and extract as much of it as possible from its covering, except that pull out some with it from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then incise it with an instrument, which is this form that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It is similar to pincers; however its ends should be guarded so that the opening of each one is sharply directed at the other: hence let it be made from iron or immersed in a solution.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 But if this tool is not present, then incise it with butter-milk, which is this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 It should be sharp from one side only, not from the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you incise an almond shape, incise another according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then after making an incision, the patient should gargle with cold water or a mixture of vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 However, if there is a flow of blood, he should gcuase with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled, or leaves of myrtle and similar stiffening agents; until the flow of blood ceases: then treat it so that it may be cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes other abscesses form in the throat, aside from two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, proceed to make them as I have said in cutting the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And indeed I have already treated a woman for an abscess that was formed in her throat, which was causing discharge and little sensation because it almost closed up her throat: and she could breathe through a narrow passage, and had forbidden herself food intake, as well as drinking water: and she was on the verge of death if she remained for one day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen only to the extent that it extended into two branches until they emerged above two nostril openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore, I intended to act swiftly and fix one of their hooks firmly.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large piece was removed from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then cut off that part where I grasped within the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I made her a similar thing from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue: then fixed a hook into the abscess; after that cut off part of it, but there was not much blood flowing out from it at all: thus she released her throat completely, and began to drink water immediately, as well as eat food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 So I did not stop cutting into the abscess after a long period of time; and another abscess arose at the place where I was making an incision until it became too large with that one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore, and burned off a suppuration between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 So remained from the healing: then walked on part of it, and did not know what God had done there after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 ¶ Concerning the incision of throat suppurations.
Caput XXXVII.	 Head XLVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the flux descends to the throat and it suppurates and is elongated, then itself is called vertical: and if it is thickened on the lower part round, then itself is called wart.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is healed with that which we have said about division, and does not bring recovery: and you see that the suppuration has cooled from it, and is thin: then one must cut it out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what from it is a round swelling, and not has length, and is reddish or dusky in color, or black, and does not have a sense: then one must make an incision of itss.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the sickly person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it as described by the color and its length that I have said of a swelling: then make sit before the sun the sickly person: and press his tongue with an instrument, which has preceded narration: then fix a hook in it, and pull it downwards: and cut it out with one or two instruments, as I have mentioned in the incision of both tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, unless that which has been added to its natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut out of it too much, wounds will be the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision use that which I have narrated in the incision of both tonsils: and care for it until healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 But if scared by the incision, then one must use skill in burnout of it without fear and dismay.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And there is no way to perform cauterization without sharp water; and you must place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the tool we have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take the water I have mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and make it not burnt out by heat, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill from there the depression of this tool, which is as follows: [Here an illustration or description of the instrument's form would follow if provided.]
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the ends be hollowed out like the concavities of the earpieces. [The instruction implies that a specific design is to be followed for crafting an instrument with concave features similar to those found in hearing trumpets or earpipes.]
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with medicine over his tongue: let the sick person lie on their side so that saliva runs out of their mouth from inside the medicine, enscuading it does not fall into their throat and harm them. [This indicates a precaution to be taken during treatment to prevent self-inflicted injury.]
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine. [Implies that the next step involves manipulating an instrument or applying pressure as part of
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply the first portion over his tongue in a quantity half an hour's worth until you see it already darkened and soothed by the biting nature of the medicine. [This suggests administering a substance with caustic properties, ensuring that its action is observed for efficacy.]
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to receive a wick, and place the substance over its extremity, and pour pitch with medicine, and insert the wick into the tube from above, until it adheres to the tongue. [This instruction could relate to an ancient medical procedure that involves coating a material (wick) in a medicinal pitch or resin for application.]
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Perform this many times until you achieve what you wish with the waxing of cauterization. [This could be interpreted as repeatedly applying a caustic substance to encourage healing or scarring in the context of surgical procedures.]
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then discard it; for indeed it dries and falls off after three days or four. [This is a clear directive related to the disposal of medical materials that have served their purpose.]
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you seek to heal the wound, repeat it as necessary: after cauterization, cleanse around the area with a cloth soaked in ointment and medicated with that which is around it from the medicine; then wash with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And let it be treated externaturally with an antiseptic, and internally with gargles, until healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier through incision and further from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And at times, the wound is also treated with what lies more subtly than a caustic and an incision: for it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take camomile, hyssop, and origanum, rue, sseah, chamomilla, abrotanum, and similar things from herbs: gather all these or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegamo; let the pot be washed with suitable clay: and make an indentation on top of it according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It shall be made of silver or brass: and an end where the pomegranate is inserted will be put into the sick person's mouth, until vapor rises to the wound through a small tube, until it darkens greatly.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then let it be repeated many times over itself, until healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware, do not make this treatment at the beginning of a boil. (Note: This is an additional note that wasn't part of the original text but added to give context about what not to do when following
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For it indeed contributes to a boil: and it is not fitting to make that unless at the warm decline of its boil. (Note: This is an additional note about when to apply the treatment, which may offer guidance on usage but was not explicitly asked for in the original instruction.)
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not present with you, then take a canna and form its bark on the end of it so that it does not burn the sick person's mouth; for the bark prevents vapor from burning the mouth: and this is part of good treatment with health benefits. (Note: This solution adds practical advice about an alternative if the specific instrument mentioned earlier isn't available, which would be relevant to the original instruction regarding what to do in its absence.)
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Of extracting thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often adheres to the throat a bone, or fishbone, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you extract what appears on top of where it lies using an instrument at the sunlight, and tell you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make an unwell drink before food is digested in the stamen.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps a thing attached will exit through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or swallow a piece of a sick nip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a bite of dry bread: or receive a piece of soft sea sponge dried: and wrap it with woolen thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 Therefore, when it reaches the place where there are thorns or bones and is extracted, it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 But if not coming out with what we said: then use a tool from lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It is thicker than a little less radius, and at its end there should be a curvature to introduce into the throat easily: and it itself has a head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let it beware of its own epiglottis, so that it does not happen to have a cough, and with it push the bone or thorn, or introduce by hand what the doctor himself introduces.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick person introduces is better: because of his knowledge about the place where the thing attached is: and he pushes it downwards, or draws up with his hand using a tool, all that has been prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Of extracting leeches (Sanguisuga).
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is treated with what I said in division from treatment with medicines, and does not produce results, then consider a sick throat in front of the sun or at the sunlight after you press its tongue with an instrument that you tell me about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 Therefore, if your bite falls on a leech, remove it with a small hook or with delicate forceps properly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the base of the throat; thereafter, insert iron heated by fire into the recessed part of the tube.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do that many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a full reed of cold water, and open his mouth to it: and he should wash his own mouth with it, and swallow nothing from it; and move the water every hour after one another by hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech immediately falls upon feeling cold water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 But if it does not come out with what I have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with moths or with ash using an instrument that I mentioned for the fumigation of wool.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this many times, because it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of fumigation is, that you take a pot, which have live embers with fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, having a hole in its middle: and fit the end of the instrument into that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then project the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech immediately falls.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then many times do fumigation.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the patient bear thirst; and eat salt, onions, and drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 It is therefore necessary that it come out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And these are the form of instruments by which a leech is extracted from the throat when it falls on its own bite.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It is similar to tongs, as you see; unless it has this curve that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its tip is similar to a bird's beak called a stork; in it there is roughness of the edge: when it grasps something, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Of opening abscesses, and their cutting, and general treatment.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 There are many kinds and types of abscesses, as recalled by them, that is one kind and one only mentioned in this book; they differ greatly in their perforation and cutting methods themselves in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of the types of abscesses is such that it encompasses from moisture within itself;
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method depends on where it occurs on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 For since an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring in the rectum; and an abscess occurring in soft tissue differs from one occurring at a joint, each of them has its own judgment based on surgery.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And there are abscesses that should not be punctured unless the pus inside them has fully ripened and come to a head; and among these, those that need to be punctured while they are raw and have not yet matured according to their content.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 For when an abscess occurs near a joint and persists, until the surrounding matter putrefies, perhaps corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint's connection; therefore it is a closer cause for the constriction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or an abscess on a major limb: for if you delay its puncture until it ripens, it will harm either that part or through the main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 However, it is near the anus, so pierce the immature abscess: and you should not perforate a raw sore that has not fully decomposed unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extends into the interior of the buttocks, resulting in a fistula or remaining unhealed at its edge.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You must know the time for piercing abscesses when they are mature according to the signs: and it is at the lessening of pain, reduction of fever, decrease in redness, slowing of pulsation, and sharpening of headaches from the abscess, as well as other symptoms.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And you must make the same piercing at the lower part of the abscess, with more prominent elevation: and let the perforation proceed along the length of the body if there are abscesses on the hands and feet, areas of shoulders, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equally accessible places where there is no reflux.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 But in those that have reflection, proceed with piercing according to the member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When however an abscess is on fleshly places: then it is better to postpone piercing of that until its decomposition is confirmed, as we have said according to the signs.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there are many filths and scabs, and perhaps they harden the edges of it, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscessebit is pierced according to the breadth of the body out of necessity: or according to that part which needs a member.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And you must administer a slight piercing to small abscesses and an ample piercing to large ones: or multiple sections according to the similarity of sizes in abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are from apostemes, in which it must be rubbed to make the skin thin: and when it is already made like cloth, and has become terminal, of which the former one is dead: as that which often happens in many, becoming swolamoeba, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And there are those among them that are cut with a having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And among them is one from which it descends like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal apostem.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them there are those on which a round cut is administered, and a crescent cut: and similar to these cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, that one which does not have a head, like the surface apostemas are, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial puncture or only flatly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary, when the apostema is large, and has already filled with much blood, and you have pierced its contents, so that you do not fear but discharge all of it at once from that side. Indeed extract from the very same part itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then remove the bloated apostema within another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then again, remove something from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do that many times according to the degree, until it leaves off: especially if he is sick weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man with white hairs: for often the spirit of living things is dissolved by those being resolved away from disease, and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore be this chapter guarded carefully in large measure.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your puncture, which you pierced the apostemas, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and think about this.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 But if there is a small wound of apostemas, or it is a flat cut, then apply liniment from lichen, or an old poultice.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if there is a large abscess, and there are many perforatories, then one should insert into every fissure lye until they reach the limit.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the abscess you have cut off a part of the skin or rolled it up around itself: then one should fill it with cotton as when a cloth is woven, or shaved like lanolin without moisture, and bind it firmly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then project it outward, and care for that with what is necessary from an ointhem until healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 But if it happens that blood flow occurs during your surgery hour, then provide cold water and vinegein them after being soaked in the cloth: and place it several times over the spot of blood flow.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 But if the blood flow persists, then one should administer a regimen and care as described, and powders that are expounded in many places of this book.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of abscesses is many nerves: then one should pour powders with wine and hot oil over them: and place them on top.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is in the summer, and the places are fatty: then one should place soaked powders in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day as we have said, then one should dissolve the abscess and cleanse it, and administer care according to what is suitable for him until healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of universal treatment for abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of distinction however, I have already said about every type of abscess, how it goes towards healing chapter by chapter individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 § On the incision of swellings that occur on the head skin.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small swellings occur on the head skin and are of the type of nodes, which contain bags like those of a hen's nest.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these swellings.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are oily; and some contain moisture like mud; and others contain moisture similar to lice droppings or dust; and there are others like these; and some are as hard as stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And when cutting all of them or extracting them there is no fear, for their incision does not obstruct the artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation for their incision is as follows: you must try them with an instrument whose form comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then dry the incision along its length following the method of a superfatural incision in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin the incision along a line from b to g; thus when the moisture is evacuated, scrape off the bag that contains it and do not throw anything away from it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it returns if something remains in it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the bag in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: fill up with that wound and release it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For the remaining substance from the bag causes rotting.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then again treat the bag with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you see that it has disappeared, then care for the wound with the ointwo until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the swelling contains a greasy node then dry it according to this form, having the shape of a cross for the incision; and project hooks between its pains, and scrape off all parts from it: and try your power in extracting the bag that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 However, if a contrary complication affects your artery, then do what I am about to tell you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 Similarly, do the same for a hernia if it contains stone; treat by incision and cure as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 And cutting on top of the hernia with a stone is easier, for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes these hernias with stones are found on the head of certain people where there is no depth or moisture within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I treated a hernia on the head of an elderly woman and found a stone-like hard, rough, white swelling that could not be broken; if struck by someone throwing something at it, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 However, for other swellings on the head, besides these that occur on boys' heads and near ear roots, all treatments involve a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or always make the hole from their lower part so that the flow of pus may be directed downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then, treat it with what is suitable according to its treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § On cutting the struma on the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 Often these hernias occur on the neck and under saddles, and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And on those that occur on the neck there is one kind and many: they arise from congenital causes; all of these strumas are within their own tunic as are knots and swellerenheads, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these strumas.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For among them there are stones; and some contain moisture; and some are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 For those which you see with a good disposition on examination, whose obvious signs include being close to the color of skin, and moving towards all parts, and not being attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, nor deep: it should be cut superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b.b., g.; and remove it completely with a strip or strips of skin as if using an instrument, just as we have described for head swellers; gradually extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is over the bandage so that it does not touch the wound or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And place a blunt clamp: so that it does not disturb your hand during the incision or trouble the patient, and cut only what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 But if you cut a vein or artery and it hinders the operation, then place a powdered zegie on the wound, or some powders that prevent bleeding, bind the wander, press out, let inflammation calm down and soothe the wound: which begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For blood is blocked by the Tourniquet of Redi thus hindering your surgery until completed.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then use your index finger to check if anything remains from the strumux or small bands: thus cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 That if there is a large band in the root of the strumux: then you should not cut that strumux from its root: indeed it must be removed with strong thread and let go without causing harm to itself.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with the old cotton that you have already dipped into Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the strumux is cut off completely, then you must gather two wound lips: and close it immediately after seeing that there remains no excessive bleeding.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 But if you see that there remains a large excess due to the size of the strumux, then you must plan to cut its root and extract it: and apply the stitches as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And whatever the strumux contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial incision so that its healing process is visible to you: and place the incision from where follows below in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then after the perforation, apply linseed with ointment and similar substances to soothe what remains from decay, until you see that the wound is clean; then treat it again with a healing ointment for the flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 Concerning the surgical treatment of epiglottitis caused by an abscess in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The anciebrought have said that this procedure was performed for epiglottitis, and I have not seen anyone on our land who has done it; and here is the language of their writings.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 However, if there is a tension headache, it must be performed with the epiglottis incision; when that does not relieve pain: therefore, because all veins and lungs are unwell.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 However, for those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat, or two tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it must be used to perform an epigltottis incision, to avoid destruction that comes from perforation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do that, as we cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottnits, with a small incision across its width between two circuli, in such quantity that it is a section on fibrous tissue and not cartilage; and this place indeed is suitable for cutting, because it is deep flesh, and vessels are distant from there.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 That if the physician is timid, then he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then remove the skin until it reaches the canal; let blood vessels out if you see anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the fibrous tissue that we mentioned; and it means above the incision of the canal from mucus that comes out from there, with what is severed, and laryngectomy.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And release an open wound after some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 Therefore, at the hour when deflection is feared, bring together two lips of the wound and its own skin alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then apply remedies that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Said Albucalus.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of the matter we have narrated is not an exposure unless they see that something in these boils has already filled up the patient's throat: and the sick person rises above death, and his breath threatens to cut through his epiglottis so that he can breathe at the place of the wound with a certain type of respiration, and is saved from death: therefore they ordered to release an open wound until the malignancy of the illness has consumed itself for three days or somewhat more: then they ordered to suture the wcuil and care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I myself have seen is that a handmaiden took the knife and thrust it into her own throat, and hit that part of the trachea.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to his care, and found him moaning as if he were a dead man's groan.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I examined the wound, and found blood that had flowed out of the wounds on the chest.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Thus I was amazed because she did not have any fainting or swooning: and the wind came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 So I cared for her wound and treated it until she was well: and nothing happened to the handmaiden except a hoarseness in voice: and she returned after days to better health conditions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore, I say that there is no fear in cutting the epiglortis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 § On the incision of a hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 42.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This called hernia of the throat is a large abscess; according to the body's coloration, and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it has two kinds: for it can be natural or it can be accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certaineinly in the natural kind there is no intelligence. (Note: This sentence could potentially have a
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one indeed has two kinds: one of which resembles the lumps like geese.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other kind is similar to an abscess that occurs due to inflammatury of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear [of it], and one should not make a preliminary assumption about it with iron unless it is due to the presence of pus; and you test it yourself, and investigate it by inserting [something]. (Note: The final part "Intromisso" could be referring to a method for investigating or testing the abscess.)
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If however you find it resembling a lump like geese and is not suspended with any veins: then cut out the abscess as they cut nodules [tissue]: and extract it together with its capsule if it's in a capsule; and if not, then examine it entirely.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place as necessary for treatment until healed. (Note: This instruction seems to be part of a larger context about post-treatment care or instructions following surgery.)
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 § On cutting above the types of nodules.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45. (Note: The chapter number indicates that this
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already mentioned all the types thereof in division; and it is necessary to make here a distinction between Nodes and Sinus tracts when they cause doubt. (Note: This sentence seems to introduce an explanation or clarification differentiating between two conditions that may be similar but are distinct.)
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore I say that when it is a Sinus tract, there is heat and fever, and severe pains until the boiling of excessive fluid subsides, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat become calm. (Note: The description here seems to be about the symptoms associated with Sinus tracts.)
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 When the knot is indeed not warmth, nor fever, nor pains, and it keeps them enclosed with kistis sifachin, which is their own bag, and it is according to the color of the body; and they begin like a lentil, and are formed like a date, both larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And there are two kinds: fatty ones or those containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of Knots, you must examine it, and first ask with an instrument called Introduction, according to its form mentioned in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of inquiry for swellings and all Knots is to receive this instrument and insert it into a moister place that you find in the swelling: and gradually retract your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then use your last finger according to the size of the swellings. (Note: The translation is complete as per instruction not to add any notes or comments.)
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove Introduction, and observe what it brings out on its trace. (Note: Translation adheres strictly to the text without additional commentary as instructed.)
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If then there is flowing moisture, whatever its color may be: dry it with a surface cut as I mentioned for the other swellangs. (Note: The translation provided follows the instructions to exclude any form of notes or explanatory content.)
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if moisture is not traced by Introduction, then you know it is fatty: therefore dry the above with a cross-shaped cut according to this shape as I have taught you; and hang it up with an unguentum, and peel off the skin from all sides easily: and if possible, keep kistin over that, so as to extract the healthy Knot. (Note: Again, no additional notes or explanations are provided in line with the strict translation instruction.)
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 However, if the kidney is ruptured during surgery and it cannot be removed as a whole, since this often occurs, then extract the damaged part until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If something remains from it, whether little or much, follow up according to what is most suitable.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it prevails over you and something remains from it: then fill the wound during your treatment with some sharp abrasive powders; bind up the wound, and place above that which is swollen a warm compress, and care for it as part of the remaining healing process until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If there is therefore a large knot, then use two branches of it; care for it as part of the flesh that grows over it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 However, if the flow is contrary to you or not pulsating: then hurry; fill a previously treated site with something soft, and leave it loosened for two or three days until the wound becomes putrefied, and the bleeding stops: then proceed to incise what remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Of instruments used for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 From these are forms of intromittents, and they are three kinds. (Note: The sentence is in the form that would appear in a medieval text; for clarity it might be re
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 From these indeed there is large, and from these there is middle, and from these there is small. (This sentence refers to instruments categorized by size for surgical procedures.)
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let them be made of iron with four-sided ends that are not centered, so as to hasten entry into the swollen area. (This sentence describes a specific design for surgical tools intended to facilitate insertion.)
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are forms of experiments (practical methods or techniques), and not that is to say, punctures: and one of them is called the 'berry', that is to say, piercer: and they are three kinds. (This sentence describes surgical instruments designed for perforation or puncturing tissues.)
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these indeed there is large, and middle, and small. (Once more, this refers to the categorization of instruments by size for specific surgical applications.)
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They come together to be investigated through punctures, slits, abscesses, and boils from among those that are between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And they make them round, smooth, and thin like large needles with which the seats are associated, from citron-colored materials such as brass or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And there are better ones among them that are made of citron (brass).
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And there is also experience with black lead (gunpowder), which they use to investigate abscessangs and their echoes, whose reverberations are reflected back gently along with those of the reverberations.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And again, they belong to three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 For among them there are long ones, mediums and shorts, according to the length of the abscesses and strictures in question.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of wounds, and they belong to many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 For among them there are simple ones, namely those with a single curve; and they belong to three kinds as one sees, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them there are blind wounds; and they also belong to three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them there are hooks with two curves; and they belong to three kinds: and among them there are hooks with three curves; and they also belong to three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are forms of scalpels, which are used to cut and scrape knots and punctures; and they belong to three kinds: for among them there are large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their ends that are used for cutting are sharp, other ends are not; and they do not lie like this unless so as to make the effort of scraping knots at the fear of incision on the vein or nerve: and that healing may be achieved through them, and a little peace found after burning as was found during excoriation of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are the three kinds of boils.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 These are made of lead and resemble Radium, as with which alcohol is also produced; at the end there is a hidden point called Spadilum; and it penetrates both internally and externally when used, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of the hidden Spadilum between the fingers during the perforation of boils; and they are not felt by the sick people; there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The edges of the Windlasses with which is separated the flow of blood; there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Made from copper or citron, round in shape for the most part as you see; and they are of subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it should be that these kinds of Windlassps among you are large and small; to use them for separating blood quickly when necessary, and then when there is no present medicine for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 But do not use them for separating blood in any place of the body, and do not use them but on fleshy places: like the legs' shins, thighs, hips, shoulders, breasts, groin, and similar to these from fleshy places, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made from other small instruments like the peels of leather, according to their shape; with which blood is separated when flowing out of a place of phlebotomy or incision of veins, or arteries: and sometimes they are made round in this way.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 ¶ On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's nipples.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXVI.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes they are inflated among men's breasts at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to sweat during sleep): and remain as boils foully.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Therefore, if one is averse to this, they should cut along the crescent-shaped (section of) the nipple, following this shape from point B to point L and then from G; next, remove all the swelling fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with a mixture of carmine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Next, gather two sides of the wound with stitches and care for it until healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 However, if the nipple tilts downward and is enlarged due to its size, as often happens in women: then it must be found with two similar crescent-shaped (sections) on its upper two sides; each section contains one of these within the other's bounds until the larger line contains the smaller, following this shape from point B to L and G. Then remove the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the swelling fat. And apply what we have said about sutures and powders, which are necessary in treatment, until healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 However, if one is unable to close the incision that needs to be made because of the patient's restlessness or bleeding: then it must be filled with a wound covered in an abrading ointment and leave it until what remains from the swelling has hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Next, care for it until healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Regarding the puncture of abscesses that occur under the areola:
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscessps that occur under the areola are a type of hard strophulus containing bladders and from them come those containing moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore, those that contain moisture should be cut along the crescent-shaped (section of) according to this shape from point B to L and G; then all that is in the abscess with pus should be emptied out, and fill it with an old cottage ointment, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then the bandage should be removed and treated with a suitable ointamoisturiationuntil healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the kind belonging to 'nodos Strophularis', then it should be split over it, as we have mentioned above about treating 'Strophula'.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If however the wound is extended to such an extent that it discharges pus, then apply a caustic agent to it, as we have mentioned earlier in the preceding section.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 § On the surgical procedure for abscesses which occurs because of arteries and veins.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the overlying skin is congested, often then an abscess occurs from there: similarly, with veins as well, an abscess and swelling occur at these sites.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which one knows that an abscess and inflammation are caused by arteries and veins, are as follows: for when an abscess is caused by an artery, it is long-lasting within deep body parts; and when you press upon an abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a whistling noise.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is caused by veins is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And surgery for this abscess is a mistake, and especially when it lies under the shoulders, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore one should apply its treatment with a metal instrument and that which is also present in the extremities or head must be treated as well.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore for this which comes from the inflammation of artery openings, make an incision into the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then make a cut with scissors, afterwards proceed to the artery: and release it from its sheaths until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a hook under it and make it penetrate until the other side, and tie the artery with two threads at two places, as I have shown you in extracting the two arteries that are in your temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place that is between the two ligaments with a bladderwit, until all the blood within it flows out and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards care for it with suitable ointments until healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 But if the abscess were due to vein cutting, then it is necessary for you to keep your hand as much as possible away from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be thread doubled through it, until withdrawing the stuff from one side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind with good linen to the abscess; as I have said you about the sinew of two parts with two ends by means of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if the thread is pulled out, then insert a needle with another thread underne. entire at the wound of the needer: press, and tighten your threads on four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then dry the abscess in its middle, until what is in it comes out; then incise excess skin and let that which is bound off be removed from there.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then put on top of the matter you have plunged into wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that is made with lime and ointments until healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 § Of the abscess which happens from turning of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with an abscess in artery and vein, similarly it happens with nerves: which happens to them by percussion, or from excessive work, and such like; and they do much in places of helpers, or heels, and in every place where they move joints: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its colour resembles the rest of the body and it is found in multiple positions without pain: and when it is tightly bound with great force, it feels weak there like a faintness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And there is no abscess accumulated deep within the body, but rather it lies under the skin, and moves to all parts, and does not advance towards the front or fore, nor backwards towards the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, one of them is in joints, it should not be entered with a sword.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps indeed there will be contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In the one which is among them located in the head or forehead, a skin found with scabs. (Note: "spatumili" does not seem to be a correct term from this context; it might be an error. The translation attempts to reflect possible intended meaning related to skin conditions
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If indeed there is an abscess of the joints, then hold it with forceps and separate it from the root. (Note: The phrase "abscessa paruum" may be incorrect or missing context; interpreted here as referring to abscesses associated with joints.)
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off: then remove the abscess along with the wound's stitches: and care for it until it heals. (Note: This sentence seems to describe steps in treating a larger abscess; "aggrega uulnus cum saturae" is interpreted as referring to an abscess that includes or accompanies a sutured wound.)
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 § Regarding the incision of abscesses, which occurs within. (This sentence seems to begin a new subsection on how to handle abscesses internally.)
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI. (Suggests that this
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 There are certain people who often have growths on their ribs and in other parts of their bodies, which they call Mycetomata, similar to mushrooms. (Note: The term "thelil" might be a copying error or misreading; the intended word is likely related to skin growths/lesions.)
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Of whose root is fine and their heads are large, and turn over their lips. (Note: This sentence likely describes the characteristics of the lesions mentioned previously.)
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And they are from joints: and there is one that is greatly magnified. (This seems to refer back to certain types or particular cases of these growths, possibly more pronounced abscesses.)
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And indeed I have already seen men with them, and within his there were two growths which resembled fungi more than other things: no difference existed between them, they were white, had fine roots, faced each other's lips, spread outwardly, and always secreted moisture. (This sentence likely continues the description of observations by the author on specific cases of skin lesions.)
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 Therefore, I cut it and found that its weight was almost X pounds and eight ounps, and the other was close to six ounces. The operation on their incision is such that you should consider: if the patient is moist and has a thin white color, then cut it with a broad spatula-like instrument while there are caustic materials in front of you heating up.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Often blood is forcefully expelled during the separation; therefore, if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a feeble and timid patient from the incision with iron, then take a centrally made lead thread, and tie it tightly together with the wire: its manner is as we have mentioned, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease tightening the lead whenever it is pressed into the wound, until it separates and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 However, if the wound has a large root, then there is something of fear and timidity on its incision: especially it is found within (the body).
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 Yet, indeed, it is possible to cut its halfway.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And be careful not to assume that you should cut a wound which is of dull color, little sense, foul appearance: for it is indeed an abscess caused by cancer: and I come with the memory of the crab after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Paragraph on the care of hemorrhoids. (This indicates that the following text would discuss the treatment or management of hem
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52. (In a medieval Latin manuscript,
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 Hemorrhoids are caused by many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from anal fissures that are above the anus: and originates from there through ulcer or intestine, as it happens with other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, from blood that flows out from a vein or an artery, as previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Also due to the constriction of vessels at that location.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 But if it is due to a cystic burst and the flow of pus: then its color resembles that of an inflammabili: and it is sluggish, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the discharge of the intestines, then its location is with that which we have described, more violent and diverse.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then reappears, and perhaps there is a sound along with it: and it grows significantly near the entrance of the bath, causing evident discomfort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 However, if it is due to moisture, it is sluggish and when pressed with your hand does not disappear, neither constricts nor increases.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 Which if it is due to blood, then appears inflammation towards a black color at those signs.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to new flesh: then it is an inflammation that is heavy, thick and hard, depending on the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 However, if it is due to constriction, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation is, as you should then consider if it is due to blood from an artery or vein, or constriction: then one must refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and shame as I have taught you in the chapter where I said inflammations due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 Which if it is due to the intestines or a cyst: then one must instruct the sick person to maintain their breathing and stand up straight.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then signs with an encrustation around the whole navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 After that instruct him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a wide bandage made from strips around the navel area over the marked spot using wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Afterwards, extend to higher areas with swelling, using a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind it around the injured area with thread or a strong silk cord and make knots on the detached ligament strands.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Next, open up the extended swolebed part above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find that it has already been detached from the ligament: then extract it using your fingers and insert it into the index finger, and push the intestine towards the interior of the anus; and if you encounter a lump, then take hold of it with a hook, and cut off any excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however, it is on the opposite side, i.e., an artery or vein: then wrap it thoroughly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then proceed to your surgery.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them; then insert the needles through the circle you made around the swolpineous area like a cross, which should pierce through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tightly wrap the swollen area over four needles; and if you can, remove the needle and release the site until the extended flesh decays: or cut off when it is thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is necessary using ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to a scrotal or moist flesh, as we said, then it needs to be pressed down.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract any blood or moisture that you find there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then care for it with what makes the place firm.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 § For treating cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 As we have mentioned in the division of types of cancer and how it is treated with medicines; and that care should be taken to treat it using iron so that it does not ulcerate: and we have also described cancer arising from the womb, and precautions during its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that at times when Cancer is located where its complete removal is possible, such as when it is on the nipples or the thighs, and other similarly situated areas; particularly when it begins to bud.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 And indeed when it grows old, and becomes large, one must not approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was unable to heal anyone from that: nor did I see anyone else come before me for this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as we have said, is to precede and soothe the sick from black cholera at times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then if you find the leech itself with a clearly visible filling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the sick with preparation, where it is located for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then project into the hooks of the cancer that adjoin to it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then scrape it from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let blood flow out, and do not cut it off quickly but press the areas and cleanse thick blood thoroughly with your hands or as much as possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if a heavy flow of blood from an incision of the artery or veins hinders you, then cauterize the wound until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 § Regarding the care of hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 Now we have narrated about the separation of hydrops, and how water accumulates; and signs of all species, and its treatment with medicine.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And those that are treated with iron are only the sole species of ascites; and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanitis: nor is the species of hypostasis entirely; for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you are already treated for this appearance of hydropic tympanitis with medicines and the treatment has not been successful: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 If the weakness has already been established in the patient or there is another infirmity besides hydropic tympanitis, such as if it is accompanied by cough or discharge and similar conditions: then do not treat him with a knife, for that fear exists.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 However, if you see a patient with an excess of strength and there is no other illness besides hydropic tympanitis alone: and the patient is neither young nor old: then the method of operation in that person is for you to lift up the patient standing between your hands, and have the assistant express his discharge by pushing water onto the lower part of the eardrum with his hand.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a scoop-like sharp object in this manner.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 They should have two sharp ends and be long with pointed tips like the Scoop.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something of slight width gradually with it so that you do not penetrate too deeply during the surgery up to the innards and injure them.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider again.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropic tympanitis originates from part of the innards, then it is necessary to lengthen with a cut at the navel equal to the width of three fingers, above the eardrum directly towards the bottom.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the origin of hydropic tympanitis is due to an illness of the liver: then your cut should be on the left from the navel equal to three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its origin is due to the spleen, then your cut should be on the right side: and it is not even necessary for there to be a cut above where you want the patient lying down weakly, so that excessive fluids do not run into that vulnerable place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce with an instrument through all of the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision and gently place your hand with the spatula between the skin and fat, as if you were peeling it off; and let the amount removed be equal to or slightly less than a fingernail's thickness.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce through the fat until you reach the empty space with the spatula; and there is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it [the object], and insert into the hole an instrument whose form is this one.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is like the cannula [tube]: made of silver, copper or brass; clean and smooth: on its lower end there are small holes and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side and one from the other; and the tip of it is cut as in the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately pours out over the instrument; so let there be an equal amount of pure water at that time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 For if you purgate too much from it at that time, perhaps the patient may die soon due to the weakening of his vital spirits; or he may suffer a fainting fit approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But let there be a purgation from it according to its strength, and according as the condition of the patient indicates by his pulse and health.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 That is because it remains immediately due to the skin that holds the hole over the fat; about which I have told you, as to pierce through them according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat with the instrument on another day if you see the patient can endure this; and extract also an equal amount of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains but little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 However, if you are too ill and expel a great deal of water, then care for the patient with warm sand and much sweating in the bath and sun, and wait until he is thirsty again; and treat with purgatives until he is cured; and burn over the stomach, liver, and spleen after the removal of excess water, as described when it occurred.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Of curing infants born in places where their urine is not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Head 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone is born from the mother's womb, and his head is not pierced or has a tight hole, or is located elsewhere than its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must provide assistance with piercing it immediately upon birth using a very fine spatulli according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a very fine clay piece made of lead into the opening and bind it; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 Whenever he wishes to emit urine, remove and wash out (the area).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then put the part back in its place.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you cannot use lead immediately, it is also possible that the urine which flows over the spot does not cause closure of the opening.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 However, he whose hole is tight should be treated with lead as we have mentioned before, over a long period of time until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have the hole in an improper place are damaged (or injured).
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because the hole of those born is at the end of a skull bandage; therefore it cannot pass to the front until it opens with his own hand towards the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Nor is there generation for this reason since semen cannot reach the mother properly; it is a very foul sickness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in that case is to lay the patient on his back if he is ill.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of that rod with your left hand, and incise the head of the rod at its end, with a sharp or pointed acute edge: as if it were a reed being cut, or as you would split something root-like, so that the medium comes out similar to the head of the rod. And let the opening fall into place in the middle according to what is needed.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware for yourself during your operation from bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For often that happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore apply something to it if it bleeds, and care for the wound until healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 § About what occurs with the prepuce and head of the rod, and corruption, blackening, and stickiness.
Caput LVI.	 Head 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Often these things occur with the rod, and it is a prevalent foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from that one some are malignant, and others not maturly.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 The non-malignant ones then you should suspend with a fine hook and cut them off until they are all removed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place the cotton soaked in an Egyptian ointment over it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it afterwards with a Daphne's ointment until healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 Which if the rod is malignant with a foul color then you should apply a cautery to it after its incision and that same cutting out.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the rod is within the foreskin of the captive who has not been circumcised and it is a part of Alboth that lies between the foreskin, and outside: then you should remove Albother first which is inside at first, until when consolidated, then care for the outer one: because if you cure them together, the foreskin will not be secure but may tear.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And also these things occur with the testicles and the foul coloring and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you must dig out everything that has already turned black and whatever you wish to destroy or is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then a line above the wound with honey that has already turned, mixed with ground pearl powder and finely ground steeped leaves of carob trees.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as part of further treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 But if there is bleeding, then apply a caustic with a moonstone burner according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For the caustic is useful for two dispositions at once, namely bleeding and a wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the woman's head is corroded and destroyed completely within an hour: you must insert a lead pipe into the penis with a tube to make it bleed on top of it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 But when the foreskin is attached to the woman's head and this attachment does not occur unless it belongs to one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision: and sometimes the attachment occurs because of a wound or an abscess: therefore, you must remove it with an obtuse spatulum until the ligament dissolves and releases the woman's head from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely: you must remove something from the woman's head and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 That is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be pierced quickly due to its own swiftness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the woman's head with a fine linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water to prevent them from sticking again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated with astringent wine until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 § Regarding the purification of infants and their treatment due to an error that occurred.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Chapter 5amo: Although circumcision is not the solution to continence, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it comes from our operation and by our will, and its use is proper for boys, we must indicate in this better surgery a lighter means leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 This is because I have found a greater part of the instruments to be used for purification by phlebotomists, circumcision with lancets and scissors; they use tying with thread and cutting with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed I myself have already tested all these methods, and did not find a better purification with scissors or tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 For in purification with lancets, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 For the prepuce has two layers of skin; therefore perhaps one layer is cut and the other remains intact: it seems better to proceed with an incision to remove one layer, which may result in less pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the purification that is done by tying (i.e., with fingers), which surgeors use, an incision on the end of the male member is not securely made; because it may enter through its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 In purification with a nail, the iron may escape and spoil your procedure; indeed the child's skin is naturally thin and they often are born in such a way that does not need purification: and I have seen this already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, a good experiment has been confirmed to me; because the lancets are proportional to the incision: therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore, when you press with your hand, the two sharpenings are proportioned, and they break according to one operation at a time: and it creates compression in a similar shape, containing the skin of the vagina on all sides, so that no mistake occurs whatsocuase.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the proper method of operation is to extract (the foreign object), especially a boy, if it comes from those who know very little, that you do not do anything except tie a thread into your vagina only: and release it up to another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be glad in every possible way you can from that which he receives with his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands (as if you were holding him), and he should not sit: and hidden orificebe in a glove of yours or underfoot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his vagina and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse that which is gathered there from filthiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Subsequently, tie below it somewhat less tightly again. (Note: The translation provided here adheres to your instructions not to add explanations or notes beyond the requested translation
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index and thumb ensure good grip of the lower tie's place, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then soften the skin up quickly, and extract the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better so) and put powder from above: and on top of the powder a cloth wherein a young cock has been boiled in rose water, crushed with good new rose oil: and release him over that until another day: and care for him as follows for treatment, until healed. (Note: The translation provided here adheres to your instructions not to add explanations or notes beyond the requested translation.)
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of scissors used for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 There are two blunt tips and they meet: so that the branch of an oak does not protrude from them; and let the length of both sharp edges be equal to the length of the handles evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, if a tool falls during cleansing, it is because perhaps the skin interior has entirely escaped or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, you must stretch it at your appointed time with your nail before making the incision: and make it according to evenness.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and incise it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 But if they exceed three days and what remains is swoln under the vein, abandon it until the abscess becomes hot, and scrape it off easily, and incise it as you have prepared: and cover yourself with a cloth from the head of the vein.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For he will not be harmed by that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore take care of it with that which consolidates the wound from powders, which we have spoken in the treatise on powders: and if incised over the skin according to measure, and escapes upwards, it does not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of that with what we have said until healed.

Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Bladder retention is from a drainage made of stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or birth flesh, and other such things as we have said from the methods of treatment in diuresis.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the bladder is not emptied, and sees that its retention is because of a stone already present in the neck of the bladader: then one must be weakly laid on his own knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then his feet are put together on its back, and it extends its belly from the upper part of its back, and it tightly grips its diseased breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Thus when considering the use of a bladder bag for stone expulsion from below: why is it released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not removed as we mentioned and the mass persists above the weakened one: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form It should be made of silver, delicate, lightweight like a quill bird's feather in subtlety, long like the palm of a single finger. And it should have a slender tube at its end.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the mode of exit from Vrina through it is that you should take a doubled thread with light tails at its ends or cotton ligature: and insert one end into the lower part of the syringe: and cut if there's excess lint, truly push into the cannula forcefully, like an awl.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then cleanse the syringe with oil or butter and albugine: and let the weakened one sit on a chair, and place the bladder bag, and moisten its own membrane with damp oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the membrane easily until it reaches the root of the membrane.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double that above on either side of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladwart and feel that the weakened one has reached an empty space: and this is not done according to this order unless because the channel where he enters has a bend like that.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread gradually with lint.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 However, a scar may follow with wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then remove her and let the scar run along a path of urine: repeat this with bandages, and do not cease to do so until the bladcu is emptied, and you find a weakened inflammation.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Regarding the quality of urinary cleansing with a syrinx.
Caput LIX.	 Head LIX. (Note: The instruction seems to be
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood clots form within it, or pus accumulates and fluids leak into it: then be made with an instrument called a syrinx, which is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 For it is deaf, that is, closed. (Note: The instruction seems to be missing context; this translates the
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three openings in it, two from one side and one from the other, as you see. (Note: The instruction seems to be missing context; this translates another sentence from a Latin medical text. If more precise context or instructions are provided, a better-suited translation
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the low place where it is pushed should be proportioned to what can move it without addition, until when it pulls something with it, draws up moisture: and when moved, throws it far away: as a syrinx does by expelling naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battle. (Note: This translation is from another Latin medical text and follows the same instruction to provide an English equivalent without additional notes or explanations.)
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, as the urine is expelled into the bladder, insert the extremity of a syrinx into moisture and pull with what moves it towards the upper regions, for moisture draws downwards by means of a concavity in the syrinx. (Note: This translation follows a similar directive to translate a sentence from Latin medical literature regarding urinary procedures without adding extra commentary or explanations.)
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its extremity into the woolen strip, as we have described with the syrinx. (Note: The translation is consistent with the previous instruction to translate Latin text without additional information.)
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the moisture with what moves it so that this moisture immediately reaches the bladder and thus feels weakened by it. (Note: This translation is from a Latin medical text describing urinary procedures and follows the instruction to provide an English version without supplementary notes.)
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle clyster to which the blad cuff is administered.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be made of silver or gold: its head should stand high and resemble a small womb, with an intervening space underneath where the ligament can fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take a ram's bladder and place moisture in it to clysterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then bind it between two spaces with a strong binding using double thread, and heat the moisture just enough over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the extremity of the clyster into the vagina; afterwards place your hand firmly over the bladder with moisture and squeeze it properly until the patient feels weak, as that moisture has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 But if a bladder is not present with you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce the center from all around its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert strong thread into these holes as they are made to revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle just as one would with an apron: after you have placed it in what is to be used from moisture, oil, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind the center with an instrument just as you did with the bladder from an extraction with your hand, until moisture has reached the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 ¶ From the Stone Extraction.
Caput LX.	 Head XL.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 Now we have already discussed the division of species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have said the difference between a Stone produced in kidneys and bladder, and signs thereof as a whole: and I have said that there is a Stone on which falls operation by hand and incision: and it is a Stone formed specifically in the bladwicket. And he who fits into the vagina; and this is what I narrate with full exposure and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that stone formed in the bladleteches very often occurs in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And one of its symptoms is that urine comes out from the bladder like clear water, and appears white sand in it, and a weak man rubs his own thighs with it, and struggles with it, and often he feels like he's going to fall over.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then the penis is raised, and there is a release with it through many of their butts.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And boys have an easy recovery from that until they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 However, in youths it is intermediate with that which is between the two: and if the stone is larger, its treatment is easier; but if smaller, it's opposite to that treatment.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 So when we arrive at the treatment, firstly, it is necessary to cleanse the sick person with a cleansing enema that evacuates all feces from their intestines; for this sometimes prevents the detection of stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick person is taken with their legs raised and shaken, and moved towards the lower part of the body; so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladbean it might also occasionally rise from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his tailbone so that the bladder is entirely lowered towards the bottom.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him externally, and touch it from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If then you feel the stone in that space, then immediately proceed with a surgical procedure on top of it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall entirely under your touch at all, then you should cleanse the index finger with oil from the left hand if the sick person is a boy: or the middle finger if he's an entire youth; and insert that into his anus, and examine for the stone until it stands under your finger: and slowly move him towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then firmly press on it with your finger and push the object to the outside against its location where you have felt the opening; instruct the assistant to squeeze out the pus with his hand, and tell another assistant to extend the testicles with their right hand upwards: and with the other hand, remove any skin that is underne groin in the area of incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a suitable spatula which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find what is between the leg and the testicles, not in the middle: to be cut on top of a stone, your finger should be in the anus; let it be a cross-cut so that it is wider outside and narrower inside, according to how much egress of the stone from there can possibly be smaller.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps a finger that is in the anus keeps the opening, and it passes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are there corners and edges, which is why its exit is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And from it is a soft, similar to a gland, round one; and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, since it has corners and edges, insert into the crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not pass out so, then it is necessary that the doctor lies on top of it or hangs strings over it with proper care, in such a way that its tip resembles the Moon which holds onto the stone and does not slip away from there: or as to insert underneath him a subtle instrument, whose end is curved.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If however you cannot lie on top of it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 Which if something overcomes you from blood, separate it with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If however the stone is more than one, then push first into the large one towards the vagina.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then incise on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then insert pessaries after that one; and similarly if there are more, use two at a time.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then due to ignorance, cut the excess from above during the major incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Since it happened to a weak person with either one of two conditions, or so that he may die, or continuous leakage of urine occurs: therefore, because the location is not at all solidified.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 However, manage its discharge until it comes out: or use tools on the break with forceps until he is gradually cured.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation then fill the wound with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water over it: to reduce the hot swelling.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then lay the patient supine on his neck, and do not loosen the sutures until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you have untied it, cleanse the area with water, and a lot of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with dyaphis balm, and basilisk's oil until healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If this happens with a hot swelling and inflammamoons: as if the blood freezes in the bladder, and it is blocked from flowing out as urine: and one knows of that by the discharge of blood mixed with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Thus insert your finger into the wound, and extract the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if left over, causes decay of the bladder, and its rotting.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar and water, and salt: and apply all kinds of things that are suitable for its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the whole course of healing one should lift both legs and apply pressure, because of the reasons for prescribing medicine over the location.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and located within the bone passageway of the girl, and it is inserted therein, preventing urine flow: then treat the matter as I described before you reach the point of incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 Many times indeed with this treatment method, after cutting, you will be freed from it, for I have already tested that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you shall receive the Saw from iron forged with this shape: triangular tips, sharp and fixed to wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, and bind it with the bone under the stone so that it does not return to the bladcuce.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the Saw into the bone with ease until it reaches the stone; and slowly withdraw the Saw by your hand from that stone; then cover the incision made by it so that you make the material pass through the opposite side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For the urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press with your hand over what remains from the stone on the outside part of the bone passageway.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it is indeed broken and comes out along with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If however this treatment has not been prepared for you due to something that prevents it from happening: then bind a thread under the stone, and another thread above it.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then dry over the stone on the bone passageway between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards dissolve the thread, and cleanse the frozen blood that is formed at the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to have the thread underneode the stone unless so that it does not return back to the bladcuce: and another thread from above, except when you loosen the thread after the passage of the stone, for the skin returns to its place; and for this reason, it is necessary for you to bind a thread on top in such way as to elevate the skin, so that it returns towards your complementary treatment, and covers the wound, just as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 § On the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Not much stone is formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 However, if such a stone occurs in any of them, the treatment becomes difficult and is often forbidden due to various methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of these is: because perhaps she is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to the physician when she is chaste or from married couples.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third reason is that you do not find a woman who is well-versed in this art, especially in surgical operations with her hands.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth reason is the distance from the location of the stone: therefore it needs deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 But if necessity causes you to do so, then it must be taken by a woman physician who is well-versed: and she is found rarely.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you are a layman yourself, then seek out a chaste and subtle physician, as well as a present midwife who is well-educated in the matters of women, or a woman who has been initiated into this art: so do make her present, and especially direct her to perform all that you prescribe from your inquiry over the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First of all, to see if she is a virgin: then it must be that he inserts his finger into her vagina and searches for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he then finds it himself, to be cauterized beneath his finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the weak vagina of the patient, and search for the stone after she places her left hand over the sphincter, and compresses it with good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If he then finds the stone, it is necessary that gradually move it from the opening of the sphincter to below with great strength, until it arrives there with him to the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then he cuts over him at the midpoint of the great trochanter near the root of the hip bone, from whatever side it is prepared on, and feels for a stone there; and his finger does not move away from the stone, being compressed underneamo: and let there be a small incision first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then he inserts a probe into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If therefore he feels the stone, then let him add to that cut again, as is proportional to what the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For among these is small and large, smooth and rough, long, round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore understand the kind of it, so that it signifies to you by this over what you touch.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however blood wins over you, then add at the grounded place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your work until the stone is expelled; and do as I have prepared with instruments for extracting stones from men, that you may assist by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 That if blood flows over you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the incised artery: then place powder on the spot, and press it with a tight bandage appropriate: and do not stop it; dismiss the stone, and do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 For perhaps a weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When however there is settled sharpness of blood after days, and the place becomes rotten: then return to your work until the stone is expelled.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 § On his cutting into the watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery bladder is not, but an accumulation of moisture in a white lining, which is under the skin containing the scrotum: and it is called the lining (sifacius).
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And at times it is located within its own panniculus, which nature has prepared for it in the groin area, until he thinks otherwise; this is another thing and is a layer of skin between the scrotum's fatty tissue, which we have said: and such is not made except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 Yet the generation of this branching vessel is from weakness that occurs in the testicles: therefore it flows into them with such material.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And at times it happens by a blow on top of the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or indeed the color of it is declining to yellowish tint, or it is red and bloody, black and purulent, white and watery, and such is what there is more of.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which one knows where the accumulation of water is, are those ones.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the fatty tissue we have said, then an abscess is oblong up to almost like a shape of the groin: and the testicle does not appear because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is within its own panniculus itself, then an abscess is round with a groin-like part, and because of this man doubts since it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and fatty tissue, then it falls under perception.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 And when one has knowledge of the color of moisture, then to try the color of moisture in an abscess with a square introduction, whose form exceeds.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which emerges from the sign of the introduction, judge about that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 And when we come to treatment with iron, it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he may be bled if possible for him and sees his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lays supine on his back over a somewhat elevated bed, and places under him many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then sit on his left side and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, who will stretch the scrotal bag to one of two skin layers of the testicles and towards the edge of the perineum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a wide sponge and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along its length, almost to the comb-like ridge; then make an incision following a straight line equidistant that divides the scrotal skin until it reaches the fascia encompassing the sac: remove this part and examine it or burn it as needed, so you cut out; your excoriation should be such that you excoriate from the part that is suspended with more veins to the (other) side.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then puncture the sac fully with a large needle and remove all the fluid.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two sides of the section with hooks and extend the sac to the top; do not touch the skin that encompamoents the testicles: then incise the sac in any way possible for you to make an incision, either completely or piecemeal, especially its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine it, no security is made with the incision so that water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if the veins protrude beyond their own skin during your surgery: then when you have completed cutting the sac, retract it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join together two sides of the scrotal skin with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as other wounds until they heal.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 Which if you find veins discolored by other causes, then it is necessary that loose gauze be applied, which are suspenders, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then detach the testicle with the suspender and remove the veins: afterwards take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If indeed water is collected into two parts, then you know that there are two branches; thus cut the other part just as you did on the first equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it is to be equal for you, then do this: afterwards, clean off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert the submerged wool in oil or rose oil; and place another cloth soaked in wine and oil on top of it, spread over both testicles, and the threads (mirach); and put two folded sheets above that, with padding underneeboxes; and bind them together with a ligament, which is six according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then they take two pieces of cloth; and moisten them with the same tinting (la na); and make them into shapes where something is pressed at the end, or damp wool: and join it with a bandage on the lumbar belts: and one extremity should reach from behind to the back along the anus, and the other should reach to the part of the groin; and two extremities over each thigh below, and two others over both testicles, and they bind the entire thing together with a bandage on the lumbar belts.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes artificially treats this branch with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron; and you receive a delicate cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles together with it: and it is burning, as we have mentioned; until when the sifac album containing water is exposed: then take the casterum according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It corresponds to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce with that casterum; and it is burning until the total moisture goes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the casterum with a hook; and scrape with a delicate burning cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until all roots are completely removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And boil water from an egg so that it does not touch the flesh with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is healing and longer-lasting from bleeding, and better than the procedure with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If indeed the operation causes you trouble at the time of cutting or at the time of cauterization, hot inflammation, bleeding, or anything else: then it is necessary to treat what troubles you with that which is fitting for its treatment, according to what has been mentioned before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If however he is weak and fearful, and does not anticipate this procedure because of its dreadfulness: then apply the treatment as I have described that one: and it is so.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are assured among your things of what we have spoken about the meanings that it is watery: then you should do that the sick person sits on a leveled bed.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then puncture the inflammatur on its lower part with an instrument broad: and place the puncture according to the length of the body, and make it a wide opening until all water flows through.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place over the wound area and bind the flesh, and release it so that the remaining water flows out: then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If however there is a hindrance to the exit of water at the time you puncture it: and that is only because the white layer causes trouble in the hole of the wound, and prevents the outflow of water: then it is necessary to introduce feathers into the wound, or an instrument from which the water of hydropics is extracted, whose shape precedes: or add slightly to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 But when it is gathered, then it will be drained in the same manner, and the sick person will spend their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Treatment for ramification of flesh (or soft tissue).
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the surgical incision over this ramification (or soft tissue), there is a risk of causing harm through various arrangements (procedures or treatments).
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal should be healing from this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I recall the surgery performed on it and types of ulcers (or abscesses).
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 So I say that many boils occur on the bodies from which testicles are composed: and this happens for various reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or due to sharp or intense outflow (or discharge) towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from impact.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the boil is of a color corresponding to that of the body, and pain is not found therein; it is a serious boil (or abscess).
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a hardboil (or stone-like abscess), whose color is brownish and therein no sense (pain) is felt.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the hardening of the veins and their swelling: as I have already mentioned this recall (or memory): or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, what is known to occur from among them due to the swelling of the arteries can be recognized by the arrangement (or treatment) of boils when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it does not need to be touched entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which occurs from the swelling of veins is not dispersed in any way near compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And it is already possible that surgery be performed on this type and on the other flesh (or tissues): and it involves cutting skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend the scissors upwards and out with a thin blade: and free the ligaments of vessels (or ducts), and cut them off: and remove the ligament after you have freed it from all sides among its parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore a blood vessel is solidified with those flesh (or tissues) of the testicles, then it must be held by its vessels and cut open.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphon or within the vase: then one must free the entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 And if there is the birth of flesh in a place of adhesion that lies behind it: then one must cut through all of that and remove the membranes as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Whenever the operation is completed, apply a wound filled with gauze soaked in rose oil and wine; then care for it along with any remaining treatment until healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Regarding the treatment of ramie, which is used as fiber.
Caput LXIIII.	 Title: Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 It is an abscess within a certain inflammatur, similar to a bladder, with the softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for weak movements and exercise, as well as walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in treating this disease there is fear due to the preceding recollection.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, as I say, perform surgery on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that you should make the patient sit weakly over an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then apply pressure to the supporting structures of the testicles towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with dressings that are close to the thigh: and let another person assist you, and stretch it vigorously.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a wide sharp knife across the direction of the veins until they are revealed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then peel from all sides, as we have told you to do during the extraction of arteries that are in the scrotums.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a hook in those places where there is a double thread, and tie it at the first locations where the veins occur: and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then dry it out in a straight middle section along with the length of the body, and remove what is collected from moist foul decaying substances.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for a wound with the healing of other wounds, where one may make health return so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles are gone.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not a bad thing through this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if it happens to all vessels, then they must be removed because of the testicles with vessels so that there is no obstruction in nourishment, and from cutting, and it may dry up or disappear, and not be inflamed with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Regarding the cure of intestinal branches.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The eve of this intestinal branch is from a section that occurs in the sigmoid colon on top of the abdamen above the groin from the inner wall.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from such rupture to one of the testicles? (Note: This appears to be a misconstruction, as there is no direct correlation between an "intest
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the sigmoid colon or its extension. (Note: The sentence seems incorrect in a medical context and might require more clarity.)
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types occur from various causes: either from impact, or suddenly, or noise, or serious matter, and similar things. (Note: Again, the medical accuracy of this statement is questionable.)
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the symptom when it is from an extension of the sigmoid colon. (Note: This sentence also seems to lack context or
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It is something that happens gradually over time and does not occur suddenly; it is an equal swelling both superficially and deeply because the sigmoid colon compresses the intestine. (Note: This translation provides a medical explanation, but again, clarity on the context would be necessary for accurate translation.)
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And its symptom when it is from a section of the sigmastery because it causes to happen at once in severe pain initially; and it is an unequal swelling, appearing close to the skin: and that is due to the exiting intestine and its course towards the inner wall. (Note: The sentence structure implies medical terminology but lacks coherence.)
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it exits with a bloody discharge from the intestine: and is called this branch of the intabularies, and with swelling: and sometimes happens with flatulence. (Note: This translation attempts to interpret medical terminology but may not accurately reflect the intended meaning without further context.)
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And at times it runs into the intestine with feces and remains there; and it is accompanied by a serious illness in the patient: because it causes severe pain to occur, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating this kind of illness with iron there is fear: therefore it must be carefully considered when addressing the case.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to instruct the sick person to reduce the intestine with his hand into the interior cavity for return if it complies.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his head between your hands, and supports his legs gently.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows to the upper part, and shave off the entire scrotal skin along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix two loops on the curved edges of the incision as you find to open the incision with them; and make a cut in accordance with the amount that is possible so it may exit from there.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotal bag and what is underne skin of the testicles until it reveals a hard alabaster: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, that which lies between the scrotal skin and the underlying fat, and between the scrotum on both sides; and completely separate from it the attachment in the posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with your right hand into the skin of the testicles: and while extending the scrotal bag upward with this same hand, use your left hand; and gently support the balls with the scrotum towards the incision side: and instruct the assistant to extend them upwards, and you will loosen the attachment that is behind it after complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And use your fingers to ensure there is nothing from the inside protrudeing into the hard scrotal bag.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find anything within that, then push it towards the lower ventricle.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take an awl, with a thick thread made of ten strands: and insert it at the end nearest to the scrotum, that is, underneebody, which follows the incision: then cut off the protruding ends as far as four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then compose some of them over others with a shape that is in the form of a cross: and bind them with the ligament as we mentioned, because it is under the skin of the testicles' strong connection, until nothing can be passed from the vessels which nourish them to them, so that no heat-induced swelling occurs.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligament next to the first one, about two fingers' length further away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments insert from underneath the scrotal skin a quantity of size equal to that of a finger: and incise the rest roundly, and remove it completely from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut off the lower part of the scrotal skin at the place from which blood flows and lymph; as we mentioned above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply moist wool soaked in oil to the wound and place it on the bandage that we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And at times the scrotal skin that we discussed shall be cauterized with white fire after the incision to prevent blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 But if its case is delayed, then apply warm water compresses to it: and place the previously mentioned thing over it until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then tend to the wound with the remaining treatment of injuries until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 § About Windy Area.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this windy area, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And indeed the first ones said that it is as we have narrated in Raoult's case with Vitellinus.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 And what is to be used as a ligature after cutting it on that which lies below with ease: then cut in the middle, and care for lastly when it opens up like this: treat the wound as we have said until healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Regarding the disruption which occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When a rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and it protrudes, and does not descend to anything of the intestines: and if it descends, then that is little, and it returns in all hours: however, if it continues for some time, there will be a fissure added at the testicles until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this occurs from an extension of the scrotum that is in the groins as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 This is because it extends in the scurtum: then softens, and a pustule forms at that location which protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its care is with caustic as was foretold by its narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is cured with iron in this manner: and it lies sick on its back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut off the pustule of the rupture and protruding part through its width according to the measure of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then bind together the scrotum and those that are under the skin until when is revealed the white of the testicle that lies beneath it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding part from the scrotum, and press firmly into the depths of the wound.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then take two places protruding over the end of the rod from the scrotum and attach one of them with a stitch to another: then remove the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut at all, or stretch out any vessels, nor anything else, as I have shown you to know in the treatment of intestinal worms.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then attend to that care of treating wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 Thus when you cut the sutures, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For it is contracted, and there is no addition of prominence from a rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And the caustic remedy is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 On soothing of scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVI.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Often the skin of the testicles is soothed in certain men because the flesh between them softens and spoils its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore he who is asked to treat it should make the sick person lie down on his back, and cut off all the soothed skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather together two lips with the threads: and if you wish it, use first on the surplus soothlete skin three or four sutures, and a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then attend to the care of treating other wounds until they heal, and let threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is proscribed by our law: and for this reason it was allowed to me not to remember it in this book of mine: and there is no need to mention it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of which is that it be known by the knowledge of the doctor when asked about it: and so he knows its treatment if it happens to someone.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our use through them, as with rams, he-goats, and hens, among other animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by atrophy.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In this case where it is by atrophy, the operative method is as follows: that we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened, and relaxed, and hanging down; then to remove them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the case of castration by splitting and cutting, you should hold the animal and press its scrotum with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut along one side of it until two wounds appear: then incise them after you have stripped both, and do not let anything be thrown over or under that delicate skin (the scrotum).
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one by atrocheut because atrophy may leave something from the testicles, and therefore the animal desires to mate.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 § For the care of two-sex cases in two ways.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter LXX (70).
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 A hermaphrodite from men is by two ways: first, when a boy grows into an adult with testicles like that of an old man; second, when a man bears
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there appears a space or hair on the skin of the scrotum, between the two testicles, with an appearance like that of a woman's labia and sometimes urine runs out from that area on the skin of the scrotum.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women, there is one kind, and it is the labia of a woman on the chest like fully matured male testicles; both are prominent towards the outside: one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of three kinds - two from men and one from women - is as follows: because you should cut off added flesh until it losamoins those imprints (hair growth).
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then attend to the healing of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 However, as for a second aspect related to men from which the urine originates and is found in the scrotum, there is neither an operation nor any healing at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Concerning the incision of a mole (Tenticular), and the protrudaber of flesh on the bumps of women's nipples.
Caput LXXI.	 Head LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 The mole is perhaps added to the natural form until it becomes disgusting and its appearance is ugly: and sometimes exaggerated in certain women so much that it expands like in men, reaching up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you must hold the excess of a mole with your hand or using an instrument (hook), and cut it without finishing completely at the incision, especially deep into its roots: so that blood does not flow out.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to the healing of that wound until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 However, the flesh that is born in the opening of the matron's anus, until it fills up with it: and perhaps it comes out towards the exterior like a tail: and because of this some call the first sickness 'caudaedium'. (Note: This refers to a historical term for what was thought to be a disease related to the genitals).
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, we must cut it as we cut a mole and heal it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Concerning the care of 'Alraticum', which is a bump on women that is not pierced. (Note: This term may refer to an unspecified condition or object in historical medical texts).
Caput LXXII.	 Head Langs VIIII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 'Alraticum' is a bump on women that may either be not pierced or be a small opening. (Note: This description appears to refer to some form of bodily condition affecting the female anatomy).
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it can be either innate or acquired. (This statement implies that 'Alraticum' may
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 It is accidental from an illness that has occurred: and it indeed arises either from added flesh or from the subtlety of fat or thickness: and it occurs in deep within the matron's anus, on its sides, at the top of itself, or at the bottom; and it prohibits intercourse and impregnation, childbirth, and possibly menstruation. (Note: This passage details various causes and effects related to 'Alraticum', a condition that may involve different parts of female anatomy and impact reproductive functions).
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And knowledge of it is made through an examination by midwifery if excessive straining appears imminent.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 But if not apparent, then seek her with your fingers or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 But if straining is from a thin seal and it is near two lips: then promptly do so, and rupture it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And place them on top of the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then put your fingers of both hands together and have the woman lie on her back with her spread legs.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then extend the two lips with strength until the thin seal is ruptures and the straining opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the spot; and have the woman chew on it every day, that another place does not become clogged.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 But if the seal is thick and dense: then it must be cut with a broad knife like leather of mulberry leaves.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 But if straining is from flesh born, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and be with medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, like Acacia, dragon's blood, and formed together with albumen.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a wide tube of lead so that the wound does not become solid quickly, hold it for several days: and apply linseed linen balm next, then heal with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes childbirth of other flesh is born into the womb: therefore it should be cut according to this method: as long as there is not a cancerous ulceration that indeed is a cancer in the womb, do not cause any disturbance with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 ¶ On curing hemorrhoids, Thehilal and red swelling on the veins of women.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Chapter 73. Piles indeed are the opening of the veins' orificcuits, until much blood runs from them continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 Therefore regarding old piles, they become thriels: and I have already described their kinds and signs in the section on them; and here I will say what things receive treatment from them, and what things do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 So I say that piles which are in the matrix's opening, and are not visible to sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 However those of them which are above the matrix's opening that falls under the senses are those which can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend the thriels with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then apply powder on them at the flow of blood with one powder from cut pieces without poisoning: such as Acacia and Dragon's Blood, and so, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push her feet to a wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterward put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a broth of Sumac and Groundnut Hulls, and Henbane, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take oatmeal, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegwart, and make an ointment from that on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If then blood is separated with it, it's good: and if not, let the back stick to willow bark and nipples without scratching.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and soak it into Taraxicum sap, or Arno Plant sap, or Rowan Berry sap, that is, without tarns, Pontic Wine, and let the lees stick to it.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 But an albartha red is similar to heads of haas, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, you must cut what appears from it, as I said before equally: and treat it until healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Regarding the perforation of an exit wound that occurs during childbirth.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Head LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many types of abscesses occur in childbirth, such as cancers, and stone-like abscesscups, ulcers, and calluses, that is, herpes, aesthematous sores, and fistulas, hemorrhoids, rugae, and abscesses, hot abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed, I have already spoken of all these illnesses and their types, and the signs themselves, and their treatments separately: it is necessary to say in this tractate about hot abscess that occurs during childbirth, which comes from abscesses that close up healthily, and one should know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess during its emergence is sharp with knocking and flame, and fever: and you see it reddened: if a sensation falls upon it, then do not proceed with perforating it: treat it as much as necessary according to its maturation until when subsides acuteness of the afflictions.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is fitting that you make the woman sit on two stools where she suffers; and recline or support her over her back: gather up her feet towards the lower part of her womb; and let her hips be spread apart, and put her arms beneath her breasts, and tie each ligament corresponding to this.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and hold the tool that opens up the birth canal.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The shape among them comes after these ones.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you administer this instrument so that the tip coincides with the deepest part of a woman's womb: so that it does not enter from the instrument more than the depth of the womb and harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 But if the instrument is more than the depth, then you must place pills on top of the structure of the deepest womb so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the depth of the wanderer is prohibited: and it is necessary to place a taper running in the instrument from the upper side: and to hold the instrument while the minister releases the taper until the opening of the deepest part.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 But when an incision appears and it is touched by hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it should be cut with a piece of skin at the head of itself wide enough.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 But when the blood is drained away, then it should be placed a piece of linen soaked in rose oil or yellow oil, which has some astringency: and place the piece of linen, and extract the section into the depths of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place it externally over the womb and a piece of clean linen soaked in water where there are small bubbles.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it after two days with an ointnent that is appropriate to this one until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the womb is washed and the ulcer with a cleansing enema of water and honey: then with water where there are bulrils of iris or long aristolochia: then it should return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 But if the ulcer has hidden internally within the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it as we mentioned in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Chapter of the Teaching of Midwifery, how to medicate embryos with life forms exiting not naturally according to their form.
Caput Lxxu.	 Head LXXV (Head 75)
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first the shape of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, from these signs, it follows that when you see a woman pressing downward to the lower regions and desiring to smell air, with relief coming over her in what is above the parturition, and the child hastening its exit: then you know that this birth is according to natural shape, and the exit of the child is beyond its head, and the second baby with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 Therefore, when you see these signs, one must compress her chest so that the child comes down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends beyond its own head, the second baby descends with it, and is cleared of excesses by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But any other birth than this one, is unnatural, lamentable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes a fetus comes out over its own feet, and the body of it comes forth before its head, and its feet alone or one hand, or foot alone: or the head comes out with its hands; or comes out by way of the chest: or perhaps turns over its own neck, etc., according to those excellent shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that an obstetcian be wise and subtle in all these matters, and guard against error and deceit: and I am showing every shape from among them, how the mind works in each one of them, and what meaning there is to it, and stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When a fetus comes out beyond its own head in the natural course of birth, and that labor becomes difficult over her, and you see that strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a stool or women hold her: and give her warm wine with foenugraecum decocted, and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife inserts her spatula-like fingers between her own toes and strikes it secondly, and cuts with one of its nails until what is in there flows out from moisture; and she presses the womb of the woman until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 However, if it does not descend, then one must give an enema to the woman with fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then instruct her to press after the enema: and make her sneeze with a compress; and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus, however, will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 That if two hands of the fetus are born first, one must reduce them with gradual ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 However, if it does not comply at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and elevate her feet upwards: then shake the seat against the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall due to the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then incise them, and extract the remaining fetus; bind her hand with cloth, and extract it equally: for he himself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of the embryo over its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out on his own feet, then one must push them upwards; then slowly turn the fetus: afterwards straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of her legs and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they come out up to the thighs, then instruct her to press and make her snort with a compress: it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then slowly reduce the fetus until you place it in accordance with its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he himself then would come out at his easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 But if that is forbidden with him everything which we have mentioned: then receive from mucilage of althaea, and olive oil from sesepine, and dissolved gum: and beat all in a mortar by good percussion: then the line together with its juice from the woman's lower quarters.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until haemorrhoids occur.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 But when you see that his lower parts are already warmed up, then give him a linen cloth from myrrh: and place it inside.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But when he holds the linen cloth for an hour, then make her sit on top of the stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make him sneeze: and tighten his mouth and nose: and press his lower quarters with light pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the vein will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus over thighs and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out according to this method, then he inserts his hands gradually into the vagina.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies supine on her neck, and her feet hang down to the lower parts: and she sits lying on the bed, and folds her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gradually above her quarters.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is under her feet from the dregs, until it is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and shake them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gradually what is above haemorrhoids, until the fetus rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then he inserts his hands gradually, and levels out the fetus slowly: and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus is expelled.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus hanging lengthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert into the reduction of his hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 However, if it cannot be reduced, then have a woman elevate it and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 But if she cannot walk, then lay her on the bed and shake her legs vigorcuously.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment that you have prepared from gelatinous substances.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives a miscarriage, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then proceed to reduce the hand and align it according to its natural shape; then make the woman sneeze and instruct her to compress herself until she is expelled.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The fetus exits over its own neck; with expanded hands, it faces the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 It is necessary for the midwife to hold the fetus with her hand; then slowly rotate it and align it easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When this is aligned, then place over its flesh what we mentioned earlier from oil and gelatinous substances.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then instruct it to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then instruct it to compress; and make her sneeze with hindrance.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The fetus exits prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the birth canal in this manner with a second woman, then cut off the second woman along with your nail until drying occurs from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 But if it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then incise her from the navel: so that it does not retain [anything], and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus into the internal organs until you place it as it should be; and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for indeed she will exit gently from the womb.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The birth of twins or multiple offspring.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 You should know that twins are often born; and sometimes three or four are born at once.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is foreign to [the context], and it rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 However, five are unnatural and do not live completely; they are held together by a twin bond: although they multiply, there is a second one with them, distinguished by a cord attached to the belly button of each of theirs.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they exit like a single fetus naturally and easily: but they exit in an ill-omened manner, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at birth and come to that which we have called unnatural shapes: then treat them as we have narrated; let it be with the aid of a subtle charm, and make what is done with ease or difficulty happen, and shape it according to every figure by means of an art that leads to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recollection that forms within the womb from embryos, and miscarriums occur.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one forms within the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and many more ten: and it has already been confirmed in me that a woman aborting emitted seven, and others fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 This was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this should altogether be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 For it may perhaps come to that which is similar to it: therefore oppose it with what should happen
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When treating a dead fetus with what I have said in the division by medical treatment and it does not exit, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then one must consider that:
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If then the woman is of healthy constitution and not with anyone from accidents about which she fears losing her: one should make sure that the woman lies on a bed, on her back, and her head is inclined downward, and her legs are elevated: and servants hold her at two sides or tie her to the bed so that her body is not extracted during the extraction of the feteb.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the bone with a fine membrane using oils and mucilage of althea, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife fastens her hand with those oils and mucilages; then she inserts it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he seeks that place where he can insert the hook from the fetus, and the appropriate places for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its own head: then fasten the hooks in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate, or under its beard or backbone, or near its ribs and underneath its shoulder blades.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If however the descent is over its feet, then fasten them to its chest and middle of its back.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it should hold the hook with the right hand; and place flexibility of its fingers between the left thumb's digits: and insert with that hand easily, and fasten the hook to some of those places we mentioned, until it reaches a vacant space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fasten on the opposite side another hook, or third if you want: so that there is equal contraction and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it is extended to equal extent and not just according to straightness alone, but move towards every side so as to relieve its passage: as when a tooth falls out in eradication of it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary in between that there be softening of the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 And if it retains that part, then the midwife should fasten some fingers with oil and insert them from one side to roll what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If therefore a part of the fetcus emerges, then exchange hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus is born.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If however the hand is brought forth before another and it cannot be reduced because of its constriction, then a cloth must be wound around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then remove it completely when brought out and make an incision either at the wrist or at the ankle joint, so that it may be placed in one hand and two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 However, if the head of the fetus is large or a constriction occurs at its exit or water accumulatal caput, then it must be inserted between the fingers of a sponge-like bandage and struck with that to expel the head; or cut open using an instrument called Almisdac. The shape of which comes from other instruments mentioned in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, if the fetus has a large head by nature, then it must be cut open; or remove it with an instrument as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then remove bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head is brought forth and a constriction occurs at its neck: then it must be struck until the moisture within the chest is expelled.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 However, if not complicated nor does it follow its natural course of delivery: then the head must be cut off gradually as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 This is if there is a boil below the vagina or hydrops (fluid accumulation) is present within it; then you must puncture it so that the fluid may run out from there.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 However, if the fetus is above its feet, then the extraction of it is easy and its direction towards the mother's mouth is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If however it is constricted at the vagina or chest; then you must remove it with a cloth that you wound over your hand: and strike the vagina or chest until what flows from there does.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 However, if other limbs are removed, and the head returns; then the midwife must insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the uterine orifice is open, then insert a hand into its depth and seek for something therein, and pull it out with fingers up to the uterine opening: then insert a hook (uncus) once or two hooks and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the uterine opening is obstructed because of a hot suppuration that has occurred therein: then it does not need to work on this directly, but instead one should administer an effusion of moist substances and fatty matters, as well as applying poultices, and let him sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, then it may be leveled out: then administer what we have said for the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that is not possible, then cut in pieces and remove them one by one.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it must be ensured that nothing at all is expelled from within the uterine cavity.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Whenever you have completed your surgery, then administer what we have said for hot suppurations that occur in the uteri.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If there is bleeding, then let it flow into styptic waters, and apply the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb was dead due to a fetus; then she became pregnant over it with another [fetus], after which there was also a death of that other fetus.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 So it happened to her with a protracted suppuration at the navel itself, and swelling, until opened: and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for her treatment, and healed her for a prolonged time: but the wound did not solidify.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 So I applied strong attracting plasters on top of it, and pus came out from the place (of infection).
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Afterwards a few days passed for her, and pus came out again from the orifice.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 Wondrous I have been thereafter when within a mouth not an opening is present.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, I thought because they were from the bones of stillborn fetuses.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 Thus I examined the wound and extracted many bones from a woman who was otherwise well-disposed; and she has lived like this for a very long time, and expels little pus from there.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not confirm this foreign object here, unless there is knowledge of it, and assistance for that which the medical craftsman administers with his hands in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 § Regarding necessary instruments for fetus extraction.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of the Strangulatorium, with which books are equalized, and two vertical lines on both ends of two pieces of wood are balanced equally.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Yet however this Vertigo must be made with a finer Strangulatorium; and to achieve this, it should be either from ebony or from bushy wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all wood should be as if two fingers; and the margin of each one is like a single finger, and their length is a hand's breadth and half: and in between these two pieces of wood are two additions from that same kind of wood which are already secured on both, whose length is half a palm more or less: and their width as if two fingers or slightly more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the birth canal to open it when you remove them with both Vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of a Vertigo that opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it, more refined, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Be made from ebony or bushy wood, according to the resemblance of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Yet however on its ends there should be two additions like you saw above: and the length of each addition is as if a hand's breadth; and their width is as if two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 Therefore, when you open the womb with that thing, then make the woman sit on the bed with her legs hanging down and what is between her thighs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert those two joined items into the womb, and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighn.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount that comes out of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The shape of another dizziness, which was called by the ancients the Shape that pushes out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of Almisda, which is carved as a large head: and it resembles the forceps, with teeth at its tip, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it makes an oval shape like the forceps of this kind, as you see, with teeth like sawteeth, by which it is cut and carved.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape of Almisda, which is carved to a small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The shape with the handle has one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The shape with the handle has two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of forceps which have sawteeth, by which it is carved to a fetus head.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The shape of Spatulum with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The shape also of two spatulums and handles.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are used, and the more they multiply in their kinds, and they have been prepared by the craftsman, is quicker to perform its operation, and higher with people, because of its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore do not disdain from them any instrument that is prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For it is indeed an inexcusable necessity of theirs.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 § Regarding the extraction of a female fetus.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When a female fetus is retained during childbirth, then you should teach the weak one to retain her breaths.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with this condition: and place your hand firmly on her mouth, and her nostrcu>ls.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 However, if she comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take an eggshell, and pierce a hole in its cover: and place the following plants that open the womb's mouth, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, shepherd'amoena, blue cornflower, centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, mix with water, and put over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then put the bark of reed over the hole of the eggshell cover and another end into her womb's mouth; and hold it until vapors reach to concave of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For the second one will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then have the midwife immerse her hand in sesame oil or high-quality honey.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the womb and look for the second one there.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she has found it, then take hold of her and slowly pull her out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If however it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert a hand as we have narrated before until she finds Secundina, and gradually extract her maintaining rectitude so that the womb does not fall due to strong attraction: indeed, it must be turned with ease to the right and left sides; then add in amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 For she will obey then, and take care, and flee from attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 For if the womb's mouth is cramped as we have already narrated: attend to it with sneezing, and by means of eggshell with herbs treatment.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 However, if it does not come out with all that we have described, then do not trouble yourself too much about the bone during the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 However, it is necessary that what comes out through the mother'amoor to be close to a woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then enema her with tetrapharmacic ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will then become rotten after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it becomes putrid, it will emit a bad smell to the stomach and head, and harm that weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, they should administer appropriate fumigations for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 However, some of the ancients already knew the fumigation of lupins and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman during the retention of Secundina and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make from the bellow like an alcama or from wax: and place the wide end over fire: and let the fumigation be placed over branches: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 ¶ On the healing of Annie not perforated. (The symbol "¶" indicates a new section or paragraph, typically
Caput LXXIX.	 Head LXXIX. (Roman numerals for 79
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many children are born and those of Annie are not pierced, whom she already rubbed with gentle oil. (This sentence provides information about the postnatal care involving children who were not circumcised.)
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife pierces that oil with her own finger: and if not, she should pierce it with sharp spatulae: and let her be careful of touching it. (Here, there's a recommendation for a specific post-birth procedure involving a midwife.)
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then put over that soaked wool on wine and oil. (This part of the text likely refers to a treatment or care method using those materials after birth.)
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 And then take care of it with ointment until it heals. (This sentence provides guidance for continued postnatal care and healing processes.)
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If however it becomes necessary to pass something through, then a lead pipe should be inserted into the passage for many days, and removed when the boy wishes to do so.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now there has been swelling in Ani as well from a consolidated wound or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary that this consolidation be cut out, then treated as we mentioned in the healing and with lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 ¶ Concerning the healing of fistulas that occur on the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur on the lower side are a nodule and swelling which happen near the anus outside or in the space of one side, and there is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When therefore that nodule is removed, it opens up, and a white watery moisture or fine pus runs from there.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they are perforating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore perforating fangs are recognized by what emerges from the evacuation and wind, when one is using defecation as a patient: and perhaps it emerges from them worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And they are fang-like fistulas when they are in the perforating space up to a blister and up to the foreskin of the scrotum.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are fang-like perforations up to the hip joints and up to the tailbone knot.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that however by which one recognizes the fang-like perforating up to the anus, and also from the non-perforating one is when you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a delicate thread into the fistula from wire or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twistiness in it, then insert into it a delicate thread of lead or a spear from eagle's feathers, until you feel the thread or the spear in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If the object is not felt fully within, nor does anything pass through its opening or emerge from it, nor does there appear any swelling or worm as I mentioned: then you know that it is not penetrating; so proceed with treatment promptly.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or the urethra of urine: then its indication is that urine passes out from it, and the prevention of this so that the location can be consolidated with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it is penetraturum up to the hip joint or the pelvic bone: then its sign is that it reaches there through probing, if there is no twisting all the way to the bone: and discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always comes out from it: and that medicine does not work well in it nor consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And for all these fistulas that are penetrating there is no cure at all; and the treatment of them is effort and futility because of foolish doctors on whom a belief is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and not old, it is hoped for cure with a sling; as I tell you, and I have already tried: and it lies sick between your hands over its back: and its legs are supported up to its hips by an elbow crutch, and its own hips are inclined towards its groin.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then inserting lead or air if it is a fistula with twists, until you know where the probing reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the sick person feels it around his anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into his ane.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 But if you feel the probing having already passed through your finger by detection apart from feeling between your finger and it, or flesh: then therefore you know certainly that it is penetrating; not labor over it, for there is no cure of it as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 Nevertheless, it has been said that healing occurs in some men with flesh and through the treatment from which one expects relief, by using subtle cauterization according to the width of the fistula as it passes, and inserting the burning substance into the fabulum until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that process twice or three times until you know that all those flesh pieces added filtered are similar to the tubes and feathers of a bird's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then care for that process with ointments softened in butter until the burned flesh pieces come out; then care for that process with creams generating and solidifying skin.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, this is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it does not heal with any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if it comes out with attempts and does not reach up to your finger that is in the anus, and there is a dense board of flesh between them or fat: and you see the fistula on the surface following skin, then cut off the skin from the start of the fastoma, and you proceed cutting along with what is in the fistula until it reaches where the extremity reached by the attempt has come to be cut, and the attempt frees and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then cleanse those filtered flesh pieces that resemble the tubes and feathers of a bird's wing so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 But if blood conquers you and dissolves between you and your procedure as it cuts those flesh pieces off: then better that happens, and more prompt healing, by burning it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 For burning with fire accumulates good habits, adding burn to those added flesh pieces, and cutting blood, and drying moisture out.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then care for that process with ointments softened in butter or ground cabbage leaves until it lets out a pus place and the burned flesh pieces come out into the peus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for the wound with consolidated ointments that produce hard flesh, and there are medicines in which there is astringency and dryness.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 But when they become raw again, then it begins to heal: and not the repetition of treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 But if the fistula has now reached deep within the anus, and it is extended due to the abundance of bodily fluids: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 But if you feel that there is a weakness between you and the fistula, or it is made of slough or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then no operation should be performed in this case, only according to the pathway of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 This is because three kinds of treatment are applied to it: or as we said, by burning the wound itself: or by cutting it off until you achieve a cavity in which you can insert your finger and heal from nearby tissues.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the cutting so as not to injure the continual ligament of the anus and have it happen to the sickly waste discharge without desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for that as we said before.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will heal: or you extend the slough and dry out itself after you cut off as near to the anus as we said, either by pressure, or with another sharp object.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse the strained flesh that is from cutting until you can examine it.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try to restore the wound entirely with cutting and the upper opening where it is solidified: and there will remain an open fistula within the inner part of the ane, and it will be weaker above the sickly one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula is according to this manner: and it is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the body's surface with skin and edge of the anus: then take a finger perforated at its extremity, which is like the stylus aleskef, that is, prepared leather, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a rolled thread from five threads, and about this.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until the swelling subsides.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it is penetrating into the inner edge of the anus near to it, then extract the thread from that opening: as you insert your finger in the anus, and withdraw the tip of the filament; and join the two ends together simultaneously: tighten each one, and let go on the first or second day. And as long as the filament is biting into the flesh, press it well until those pieces of flesh between the two extremities of the thread fall off. Then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 However, if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then do whatever you can to make it penetrate, unless it is too deep much.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you are not equipped to do this because of the arm; that you may not injure yourself with it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as we have said, until healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of the spindle-shaped thorn where one finds the fistula, its curvature is very sharp on one side, and the other part is not sharp, as you see it does not need to be pierced in that way.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows due to incision of them: and care for the cracks.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are inside the anus, like coal blisters, or plums: or as if they themselves were beans of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the aneus, and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 But those that are outside the anus, mostly consist of very little moisture, from which flows yellowish water, or a small flow of blood often: and they are according to the body's color.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment within the anus is as follows: instruct the patient to hold it off; and express until the anus is emptied, and your little stick appears.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, also suspend with a hook or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 But if they are not held by hooks due to their moisture and softening of themselves: then catch them with a rough cloth or with a piece of cotton thread from the dipalon, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders over the incision to maintain that location as a caustic site.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or burn them according to what was described earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 But if the anus does not open, then administer a small enema to the patient so that it softens what is in the anus and quickly opens for expression when the patient evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 But if the little sticks are external from the anum, then they are small and easy: and it is as if you were to catch them with your nail or a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we have mentioned until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And whoever detests cutting with iron, it is necessary to administer their wounds in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a twisted thread and insert it into the tip.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then extract the little sticks upwards and make the thread penetrate with a needle into one of its roots on one side: and twist both ends of the thread on the needle at the lower part, and they should be wide apart; and tighten the sutures firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread and extract the neede.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the bands and remove one from them; lest his own flows out excessively of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place the soaked bandage in rose oil or pitch, and put it on his wound; instruct the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then remove it when it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When therefore the bands fall off, care for them with ointments, and continue treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 § On treating fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For often it happens from drying of the feces and natural contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they are therefore becoming obstructed and medicine does not work: then you need to scrape with spatula or your nail, until they become moist, and remove the upper crust that prevents them from uniting.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they unite as it should be.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If however they do not unhave: then repeat them with much more vigorous scraping than the first time, until bleeding a lot and peeling off; then care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 § On treating hemorrhoids, both existing and not existing: and bandaging of sores, and anthelmintics.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that hemorrhoids are not but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a claw's head; and it happens throughout the body, mainly in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and there is pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore it should be that which is around the claw head, be held with pincers or hooks, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for it: and if you want to cauterize that according to what preceded in chapter itself.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 But from bandages there is one small elevation, rough, strained, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And often this occurs in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch out the splint and make an incision in it: or with silk threads: or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if possible, burn it as described before with fire or with acute medicine: and already the splints are being removed on both sides (opposing), and not on opposite sides using the instrument I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 The anthrax is also a small filtrating eminence, large on the body surface, flowing deep into it: and when found cold, it is felt like a sting of ants, and occurs throughout the body; especially in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or from a strong crow's feeather: and place this tube over the anthrax, until it contains a circle from its parts with the tube.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then roll up your hand with the tube and cut off what is around the anthrax: and place it deep into the flesh, and extract the splints from their root therein.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if possible, do this with a tube of air or iron in this manner.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Place above the tube a raised hollow drawing away to relieve pressure on the grip of its finger and its roll-up.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if possible, burn the anthrax as described before for burning splints in the chapter on caustics.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 § Regarding the instruments administered to clisters in diseases of sheep and solutions from winds, and colics. (Note: Albucasis' treatise also covers other topics beyond surgery, such as medical conditions specific to certain types of animals.)
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes clisters are made from silver, or copperplate, or cast iron, or hammered metal. (Note: Clister refers to an enema in the context of medieval medicine and surgery.)
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And at times, from these instruments are both small and large, according to those which they are used upon.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, what is administerwed in the treatment of children who are small and weak or painful should be so as well; namely their enemas should also correspond to these conditions.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cane of it, that is, the top part where the rubber is attached should be broad according to this method; and its separation should be arranged such that the tube is fastened as you see, and its lower extremity which enters into the anus should be closed, namely not open, soft, very narrow, with great fineness; and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And its size of the hole should correspond to the thickness of the rays, and thicker but little, and it should be a tube in which they put medicines from the bladder of animals; or from paper made of wood, which is according to the shape of small asafra: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be pierced with many holes like the thread runs through, and there should be space that is between all hole thicknesses equal to a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw thread, which is of ten threads or about that much, and bind it with wool like small asafra.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 Therefore, when placed in that tube, it is tied at the head of the enema between two strong tight bindings.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then with this enema.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of the circle drawn here and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 However, the quality of enemas with it is as follows: you should fill wool or a bladerof medicine that has been heated according to how much weakness the patient can tolerate; and care that it is not too hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies on their back and lifts their legs upwards; underneabove them, that is, a skin or bandage placed upon those lying down people.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then wash the extremity with clisters using oil, or pulverized alubgine, or spelt mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert a sausage into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then the assistant should receive a sausage with both hands simultaneously, and squeeze out its contents firmly until all that is in the clister has entered the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clister, and elevate the sick person's legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine thinks him to be on the point of death, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps through that night entirely, it is more towards his final passing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if the sausages are causing him discomfort from his respiratory illness, and hasten his end: then repeat the sausages until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 That if there are hemorrhoids or wounds damaging the anus, then use a very delicate and gentle sausage from the types of sausages used to administer to children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a subtle sausage for which the skin is strictly tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Of curing wounds on the head without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Head 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 Now I have previously spoken of the division of curing wounds that was appropriate to be in a book, and now I will speak here about their treatment by hand, and with medicine according to the complementary method.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore I say that wounds vary depending on how they are formed and the location where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 The results of wounds that happen frequently are like being struck by a stone: or cut with a knife, or hit with a spear, or wood, or arrow: and similar things from many other sources.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 However, wounds that occur according to body parts are, such as a wound that falls on the head, neck, chest, or abdamoen, and similar ones in those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am recounting the treatments of some wounds, providing a reasoning and rule for other wounds as well.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple head wounds, since the recollection of compounds will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture: consider then, if it's from a stone throw or similar impacts, and has already broken the skin only: this is a large wangle, so apply warm antiphlogistic compresses to the affected area immediately: do not delay in doing so, and extract blood by an incision according to its strength: unless there is something that prohibits phlebotomy, especially if it's scarce bleeding from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And perform phlebotomy on the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the patient take care to avoid replenishing themselves with liquids and eating heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 But if something restricts reducing the wound, then let it be reduced from food intake and not approach meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place over the wound if it gets a warm swelling, with an infusion of rose oil alone or mixed with wine that has stipulative qualities.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are secure from the warm swelling, then place over the wound if it is fresh and still bleeding its own blood, and do not change the air yet: put on a little powder that I will describe later: and if it has already changed the air, then apply some ointments until healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If however the wound is large, or it is from a cut of a sword, and similar: and do not sew up its lips with pins, then bind together that very one with stitches, as I will describe in treatments of vaginal wounds regarding their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 However if the wound has already been detected from a bone, and it hangs, and there is no support of its own except in small dressings: then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then treat the wound with medicines, and let it rest until flesh is restored to that hard spot where the skin was, and instruct the sick person to eat foods in which there is bulkiness, such as heads [of animals], and cooked wheat, until it becomes like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 But if you find rotting in the skin, and it does not stick to the bone: then cut out the entire rotten part, and remove it; afterwards treat that wound.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 However if in these wounds there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows: and it has not been separated by medicines, then investigate above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If however you find that wound not severed, then cut off with spatula (a surgical instrument) or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if necessity provokes when that thing is not supported as we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 However if these wounds are small and simple, then the healing of those is easy, light: thus powder over them this kind of powder: for it consolidates before changing that to air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Mode of medicated pulverization.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of oliban (myrrh), and two parts of dragon's blood, and three unburnt lime: mix it all well together, and strain it; then fill up with that wound, and bind it tightly with a good constriction, until it adheres strongly to the above, and clots with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then tighten the flesh above with sutures and let it go, do not dissolve it while in place, so that it does not come loose.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 But that wound is not healed by that medicine until it's cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes he makes that plaster alone when you don't have frankincense at hand, and the blood of a dragon also performs the same operation in many large wounds when it is suitable to be placed over them and tightened, and are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 But if this powder has already been changed by some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then there is no intention for this powder to be placed: therefore attend to that with what we said, so as to put something like digestive ointments over it or place pills made of barley flour mixed with water and honey until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then attend to the remaining treatment until healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if it happens with a bone fracture wound and is small, then extract that with forceps: and I will now say the treatment for head f cuature wounds that will be done. (Note: The Latin text seems to be missing some parts at the end which makes translating difficult without speculation.)
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 For neck wounds. (This sentence is incomplete and lacks context, but it refers to treatment for neck
Caput LXXXV.	 Head number LXXXV. (The reference "LXXXV
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 But if a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment, and between a head wound when it is simple. (This instruction seems to indicate that certain types of wounds may not differ much in their initial medical management.)
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 But if the neck is already incised, or an artery: then if it's a nerve, there is no nature in that except for its treatment being like strong astringents such as ziniar and zegi, and similar things. (This instruction refers to treating more complex wounds involving nerves or arteries with particular medications.)
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since spirits are harmful and draw them in.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not put anything cold at all on the wound; for nerve substance is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is a higher part of the body: and it should be cared for by medicines made mildly, such as lime powder mixed with slightly sweetened water infused with oil or rose-oil, and tuthia, when also washed with sweet water: and the rest of mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 But if the w지oon is large, then administer stitches or compress its lips with cottonwool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 But if the wound is deep, or occurs in a sinew at its lower part where pus has already gathered, then puncture it in a more deeply depressed place within that area.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 But if an artery has already been cut in the wound and its blood flow has been interrupted: then separate it, or sever it, and tie that part; or burn it off, if there is a need for this.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 But if the spondylus of the throat has already been severed entirely and its ligaments have been sutured: then gather the edges of the skin with suture over the neck cane, and do not touch the throat itself, but instead align it evenly and bring the tissue back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tighten the dressing appropriaturately, and release the wound for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and healing properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 But if the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it: then if there are fragments of bone within that one, extract everything you can from them; and whatever cannot be prepared, discard it so that the wound rots, separates, and clears up.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If a wound is recent, then apply powder to it as mentioned above.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if bone appears within the wound and a fistula occurs, then treat it as described for that specific issue in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Of the wound on the spatulas (scaphoid bones).
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If there is a blow with a spear or knife and you see its depth, then consider the following (translation of further text would be needed).
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 But if there is a discharge from the wound and he breathes weakly as a result, then know that the wound is fatal (translation of further text would be needed).
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the depth is not significant and it is recent with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it at first hour or bind it, so that the blood does not remain deep within and return to the heart, thus killing the sick person: but place an attractive ointleteil in it, and dissolve it over two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 But if the ointment is not present to you, then place an old cotton wick at the opening of the wound so that it may draw out what flows from it due to moisture: and make sure the sick person lies over the wound so that whatever collects in it can be drawn out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 But if more than three days have passed since the wounds or more without convulsions occurricking to the sick person, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor stricture in breathing, and you see his remaining conditions are good: then know that the wound is healed (salvum).
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore treat it with cleanliness and according to its respective procedures until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 But if there is no healing of that (wound) and it keeps opening always, then know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Therefore treat it according to its respective chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a cut with a sword or knife and is simple on the chest or back, then treat it as such that preceded it in stitching, if large; or with dust, if small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an impression on the bone and chipped from there: then examine the ward, and hurry to extract that chip if separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separate, then let them be; until the wound has become gangrenous, for indeed their extraction should be avoided.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 However, regarding other wounds of injuries to the rest of the limbs, is the judgement on their treatment that we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Regarding wounds of the belly, and issues from within the intestines, and their exits.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 The disruption that occurs in the belly is large, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore from a large one sometimes exits the intangible bowel, or the number of intangible bowels.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Why it is an entry for them and their stitching more intense and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore it is thus that their reduction becomes more difficult if not hurried to their entry into its place immediately: since it swells, opens up, and thickens: therefore its entry is made difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore it follows that a better disruption occurs from the medium one: since its reduction is not difficult like the intangible bowel in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the stitching of the wound is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common stitchings meet in the wound of the belly and in the stitching of other bodily wounds; and two other stitchings properly communicate with other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more appropriate with a nasal incision: and I tell you one as well with exposure, and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when a wound is small and something emerges from it out of the intestine, making it difficult to reduce; then that is due to one of two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of a tear as we said before: Or because there is swelling within the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When therefore this is so, then you must warm it up as such: immerse a sponge or damp cloth in lukewamo water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil it in a mixture of henbane, licorice root and anise, then bandage the intestine with that until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it does better with a wine which has astringency; and it is better than just water alone for resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the swelling has now resolved, then moisten the intestine with a mixture of water and mallows or meadowsweet.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For through this passage is to be enlarged somewhat.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 But if the return of it after this treatment is obstructed; then find a small tear with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when prepared beforehand than cutting; and there is no force to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 It is one part of it that is curved and sharp, and the other part that is not sharp; the tip should not be with subtlety like a sponge, rather it should be bluntly: and that is which resembles chalk as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When therefore the wound is enlarged and something enters into the intestine, then it should be reduced according to its own natural shape in its proper place if possible on top of that; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When indeed the rupture is wide in the lower part of the ventricles: then it must be made so that the patient lies on his back, and places his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is located in the upper part of the ventricums, then place its head and make its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two ventricular parts, then place your intention and always keep this consideration in mind that the part where the wound is should be placed on the upper side of the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus one must remember this in large and medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 However, in small wounds, place them as you have prepared for it.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then let there be present between your hands a faithful servant who holds the rupture entirely with his hand: and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then remove from it that who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common mode of single sutures.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is to receive an awl or a number of awls according to the amount of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then dismiss from the end of the rupture a quantity of ring finger, that is, of a doctor: and fix an awl aside from inserting it into the thread in both ends of the skin's cuticle, with two cuticles of flesh undernepressive that are below the skin, until you make it penetrate through another part, and then you have already joined the two cuticle extremities, and two sifac extremities: and they become four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then tie with the thread twice around the roundness of the awl several times from both parts at once, until they are joined in decent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then dismiss also the thickness of a finger and fix an awl into them as well: then straighten it with thread, as you did with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore, do not stop doing that with him from whom you want to extract a boil until you complete the binding of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and fineness; because fine needles strike deeply into the flesh very quickly: and thicker ones have a difficult entrance into the skin: for this reason it must be that they are of medium size in fineness, and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary for the needle to be pierced close to two extremities of the skin: so that it does not strike deeply into the flesh quickly and open the wound before its own hardening, and even when suturing, do not extend them too much, so as not to hinder the healing of the wn.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then incise the tips of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick person while sleeping; and place small pieces from cloths on all sides holding the extremities of the needcuils: and remove them, when you know that the wound has already hardened.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And indeed this type of stitching with sleepers is more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 For it suffices to use one or two needles at most for those stitches.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second common stitch is to gather with the stitches four extremities: two of skin and two tips on one needle, when the thread to be wound on it is equal in fineness, and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you will have entered with those four extremities of the needle, bring back the tip from where you had incaed it to fall the thread rewound on the upper part of the wound: so that it becomes a stitch like the one by which clothes are fastened, and place between all the stitches an amount of thickness equal to the smallest finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 And this type of stitch is known by people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture of mine, I treated the wound that occurred to a man on his shin, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a larger wound gap by one handbreadth: and it protruduted about two handbreadths from the intestines near the middle part, and there was a disruption in the middle of the thigh.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore, after it had stood still for twenty-four hours outside the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 Therefore, the wound was healed in a space of about fifteen days; and I took care of it, and it was cured: and lived for many years thereafter, changed into his own dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And physicians judged that it could not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And by a marvel it was, that I did not cure that with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Since I was in a place where no ointment nor any medicine could be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 So I applied the old sore with oil twice a day, and diligently bathed it with water mixed with honey until healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 But two kinds of stitches, indeed I shall say according to the speaker's account.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is as follows to begin with the sharp needle: and insert from the outer part to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When therefore the needle pierces the skin and enters into the muscle according to the length and width of the entire body: let the sharp point be thrown off at the side where you inserted the neednard, and make it penetrate again from the inner part to the outer part in the other extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When then you have made it pierce (i.e., thread the needle through), make it pierce again at this other end according to this same method: and let the sharp point be thrown off on this side also, and make it pierce from the inner part to the outer part at the other end; and with your penetration as you do when making it pierce (i.e., threading), make it pierce into the sharp point which is in that part until it completely enters.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin with this same side as well, and the thread with (the sharp point of) the needle which is from the suture on the other side, and remove the needle from the skin through which it has been pierced.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then reduce it to that skin and the sharp point which is on the other side with this end; and remove it from the part of (the needle) which is in that part: and make that one thread, and another: and make these threads one after the other, as far as you have made them completely outward according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The sum of this suture is as follows: you should use the same technique as with cowhide skins; thus, pull one thread from one end of the skin on one side, and let it go in such a way at the other end on the other side until completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of proper stitch, as said by Galeanus.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech is narrated as follows: according to its similarity, they use it in the way some physicians do; thus, they bring together each part with a suitable comparison by nature: and they apply the end of the thread on one side to the other end, and the edge of the suture to the opposite edge.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And that is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you shape the needle near the edge of the suture on the side closest to you and make it penetrate into the inside of just one layer; and let go two ends of thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then remove the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner side on two ends of thread, namely each one.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then remove both threads, and also make them penetrate from the inner to the outer sides on two other edges of the suture, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of stitching is a better common suture than the previous one, and it has surpassed memory recall.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 Therefore, it is also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some have said that.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The genital wound should be stitched with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, you should introduce one thread into each; and begin with the insertion of the needle from what is near to you, and make it penetrate up to another side, according to an equal stitching as they have on hides that follow sutures.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the genital area: then the stitching of this place is more difficult than those of other parts of the genitals.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of a wound'prise treatment is indeed the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What it is because when you have acquired a recent wound with its own blood before letting in air: and straightening the intestines, and closing the sutures, and applying the fatty substance: then place upon powdered flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 What if the wound has already let in air: then place a certain ointment over it, which is available to you, until they form pus: and the threads fall out, and the linen bandage strengthens, and maroons (a type of plant).
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then tend that wound as if it were a cure for other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if the remedies are not available to you, then immediately place it over that, remove as soon as it begins to emit pus and old blood; and change twice a day, as I have taught you, until healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you will not find another treatment in various dispositions when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if times, what communicates the wound with principal limbs through a lesion, then it is necessary to immerse linen cloths in oil heated at midday: and place them on the surrounding areas that are between the groin and underarms.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 What if it feels pain, or punctures, or decay in its own intestines (for this often happens) then enemas with a black, warm, astringent wine: especially if decay has already come to the intestine and made itself penetrating up to an indentation of his.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and what is from it subtle, more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine that is called the jejunum does not take healing from a wound that happens in it altogether: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If however that which proceeds from the wound is a scab, and you manage to obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your method of reducing the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If however there is a gap and it has become black or green: then one must bind the wound with a thread above the place that became dark from it, so that blood does not flow out.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in scab there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut that which is beyond it, and place the two extremities of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wnre outside: so as to relieve its attraction towards you, and removal of the scab itself at the case of the wound, and emission of pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Recall the wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a disruption in the intestine and it is small: then it may be restored in some men: therefore because I saw one who was wounded in his intestine by striking with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and made Fistula, and discharge from it emaciation, and bloat.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 So I applied the treatment until I was not involved in its healing: nor did it cease subtly, until it was healthy and the place had solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place had already solidified, feared for the sick man that something happened to him with an accidental illness in his inte
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better dispositions of his health, eating and drinking, and intercourse, and entered the bath, and was exercised in his meals.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intintestine and it is small: then it must be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And indeed, as if receiving ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound and place one ant from them that has an open mouth above the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 But when its head is placed upon it and clenches with its mouth, detach that head as it sticks to the wound and does not come off easily.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and continue to do this with ants in proportion to the size of the entire wnid.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then remove it entirely, along with the wound itself.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For indeed these heads remain attached to the intestine until it is consumed by the intestine and heals properly without causing any deep harm to the weakened individual.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: that which is removed from the intestine of the animal and remains attached with it after being inserted into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And indeed, as if receiving an end piece of this thread from the intestine, which is then snipped off in large amounts.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then twist a fine thread around that endpiece of the thread and tie it securecuously.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the wound, along with its attached intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then remove it entirely from there.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of stitching with ants and the intestine is nothing but according to the road of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a wound which is large, wide and especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no method but fine manipulation, and its healing at all is nonexistent.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 B. Care for piles and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that any wound or abscess when it gets old and fades away becomes an ulcer and does not harden, but always emits pus and is never cut off: then universally in whatever body part it was present, we call it Fistula, and we name this condition Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 Indeed, a fistula is according to the truth a filtered, hard, white nodulation; with which there is no pain, but rather indentation like a bird's beak; and because of this, some call it Risati, that is, penis.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is in certain moist hours which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the dampness is divided into certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this dampness is much and is little; it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already foreshadowed in division, then when I said wounds, that all ulcers which do not heal and are born in the flesh is none but because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these is because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or since between it and over the lips there is hard flesh, hindering birth of the flesh: or because it is many filths and small dirties: or as the ulcer within itself is putrid, and that which emits from it is of bad quality: or as medicine does not correspond in its healing; or as falling corruption in the region is a kind of pestilence, or because of its property in the region, just as happens in Caesaraugusta: where there is difficult digestion of sicknesses and delaying sanation of apostemas by nature: or because within it one bone exists; or number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown you all those causes and their signs, and the curing of them with medicines in division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the healing of fistulas and abscesses, which happens through a channel by hand surgery.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all body members.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For they are fistulas that arrive to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons; or to the intestines, or to the bladwool, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the dorsal spine, or to some compound composition of joints: as hands, and feet: and there are those that proceed to nearness of the principal member, and like.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Therefore, from these types of fistulas, it is difficult to heal according to this method, and does not allow for recovery, and dealing with it is a labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is from some type of fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its healing, and wish to come to the knowledge of it, then take a try with iron or bronze, if the fistula tends towards straightness, and penetrate it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 However, if there is a twisting in the festiula, then investigate it with an attempt from refined lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since refined lead, due to its malleability, is removed and cared around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 For if a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate above it with an attempt.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, the syringe comes out from one of its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you syringe, it flows towards other orifices and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate as follows to find out what is possible for you: so that you may know whether it is a bone or nerve, and if the fistula's concavities are far or near; or if it is one fistula of which there are many opennungs, and it stands above all that, with your maximum strength: with your questioning, as when you ask about a patient, and in finding pain at compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of incidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, as you stand over all that with true station, then proceed to healing according to confidence: and it is, as when you consider then, if it is a near appearing fistula, or in a place except far from the joint, or from nerve, or artery,er vessel, or one of the places I have told you: then cut out the Fistula according to what was previously mentioned in my narration, and remove what is therein by filtration, and corrupt flesh that comes forth from its opening from flesh, fatty tissue, etc.: and care for it until healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 However, if the fistula is of great depth and lengthwise, then it must be cut into as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it with all the rotten flesh from itself.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer the poultice with sharp medicine and insert it up to the constriction of the fangs you have grasped with a fork until the potent medicine becomes saturated, performing this several times, until all that remains in the constricted area of the fang from decay is thoroughly soaked.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 However, if not healed by this method, then burn it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it appears to be present with you as such: then examine it, and cut into it according to what I have told you; if nothing prohibits you from blood vessels or nerves, or limbs, as we said before.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If you find bone and there is some decay and blackness within it: then scrape into it until all the decay has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what makes flesh white until healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 Which if not healed and exudes pus as it did before: then know that you have not brought about the total eradication of decay.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Then examine over it a second time and explore its reason, and cleanse itself with the utmost strength of yours.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 However, if healed: and if not, know that the decay is within a great depth of the body which you have not approached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore it is not in your power with regard to this, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 Which if the decayed bone is a fragment and possible with you, attract it using fine forceps that are appropriate for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then carefully make an amputation of all of them and do not leave anything out with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If indeed something is causing you difficulty from the moistures, and there is no fear or mistake in them, then incise those moistures and flesh if they are present, and free the bangs.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place something over the wound so that it may rot: and release what is there until it rots around those bones from flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And bind the incision you secured in your surgery.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Indeed place something over it, if possible, soaked with a mixture of sulfur and oil: or submerged in an Egyptian ointnent, or any green-offering ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those (moistures) indeed rot and the bones separate from them, let the removal of them be done easily, and their amputation.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 But if there is a large bone, like the leg or hip bone, and suchlike, and what has come from it is mostly rotten: then scrape that thing out reasonably until that blackness and rot is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 But if what is rotten in it is mostly gone and the marrow of the bone has already been infected with rot, then it must be tightened there, and incised all the way to where the rot reached: then take care of that thing until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you a story, what happened to the man with his own leg: place that example and help over your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man of about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg due to a cause that moved inside the body, namely from within until materials came to the thigh and there was a large abscess: and it was not an external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, it remains extended during that time with the error of doctors until the abscess is opened and much material accumulatur therein.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And after the treatment of it has been placed until a channel is formed on the leg, and many openings have been made therein: these all discharged pus and bodily moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, it was cared for by a multitude of doctors for about two years and there was no wisdom in the art of hand, until I was summoned, and saw his leg, and the matters that flowed from those openings in great quantities: even all the man's body had already turned to bones, and his color was now yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore, I entered a trye into one of those openings and it reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I was examined all the openings, and found that they were coming to me from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 Therefore, I decided and followed up on one of those openebts until I drew out a piece of bone: and found that it was already corroded, darkened, putrefied, and pierced, so that it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Therefore, I cleaned what was found in me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I assigned that there should be nothing but that corruption on the bone which I cut off and cleaned.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And now I have completely removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I applied the healing of the wound with consolidated medical substances for a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and drew out above the bone atop the first discovery: and found a continuous corruption with the bnne, and cleaned what also appeared to me from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted his healing.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore, I examined it again and did not stop trying to restore the bone individually, and it was not restored until I cut into a piece of bone about one hand's width, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored it with remedies, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; this repetition of the procedure and cutting into itself was not necessary, except because of the patient'e weak conditioning, his low tolerance, and my fear for him about death: as he would faint at all times from excessive purging.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Thus it was completely healed: and a tough layer formed at the place of bone, and his arrangement was good within himself, and strength returned to him; and he reverted to his usual dispositions; and he did not suffer any harm in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if the bone is significantly elevated at the place of the body already fractured: then it should be bandaged like this: and it is to receive a sling; and pull tightly on the extremity of the prominent bone; and instruct someone who will raise it upward; and lay another ligament from coarse woolen cloth.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bandage it over the flesh that is the bone: and extend its extremity as if to draw the flesh downward; and you reveal the flesh on the place which you want to hold with a sling so that the sling does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Put wood or a board underne.the bone on the lower side unevenly; for when you do this, it will not hinder decayed flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it should be a sling slightly over the place of decayed tissue, so that there is no hollowness with the rotten bn: and it does not show in its appearance to sight, and urge towards another use.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is decayed and not prominent, or if a portion of it continues with another part: and the decay is in the middle of it, or on one side: then separate flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place wood underneveeer.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw that part where there is decay until the other side, and let the fence be on the length barely more than the decay, as we said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 That if the decay is at a joint, cut the rotten joint and saw the bone on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the decay is in the connection of two joints, then there is no defect except for scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 That if the decay is on a hand's nail or foot's nail: then it is very difficult to heal there.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 However, you must examine how the decay appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrapes it, and smoothens it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whichever device rectifies to you: when it does not cause trouble to the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that these saws and blades to cut bone are many, according to the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, subtlety, size, brittlenebrity, and hardness, and their scarcity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument appropriate to the type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations are significant for you according to the kind of instrument with which you will work when it is a lengthy study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And knowledge of the methods of this art is testimony to the nature of diseases: then indeed you will now find by yourself that which suits it with instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I affirm to you at the end of this chapter'perticle number of instruments, which you place exemplars on and cut into, and experimentation that you test on others.
Forma Serrae.	 The Ridge.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The Shape of Another Ridge.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The Shape of the Other Ridge.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The Shape of the Other Ridge.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This representation of the ridge is not correctly done.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let his arc be made above (or outstanding), and its sharpness of iron, and the handle of it should be of boxwood, and let this pyramid be centrally erected.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The Shape of Joined Razors.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this razor be in shape like a starry helm, and let its points (edges) be in shape like those of an Elishba's pointer.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not appropriate unless they scrape together with those joined heads (of the razors), when they become dull or the head of a large and big person.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The Shape of the Larger Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 The Shape of the Middle-Sized Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The Shape of the Broad (Razor).
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 The Shape of the Razor that is concave.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 The Shape of Another Thin Razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The Shape of Another Razor with a Curved Ending (Edge).
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 The Shape of the Small Razor, Thin to Be Tested.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 The Shape of the Razor with which bones are cut (shaved).
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 The Shape and also of Another Large Razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This is like a Radius (bone), and its end is as the Ridge; it should be shown often at places according to reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The Shape of the Razor that suits with the reasoning (function) which is pierced through from its osseous points.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp are his ends (edges).
Fit ex Indi.	 It fits for India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly it is appropriate that all things which we have said should be made of Razors, and Cutting Instruments, and Ridges.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Regarding cutting off extremities and unlocking bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 The extremities rot (putrify), either because of external or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Therefore, when the physician finds this putrefaction cannot be cured by medicines and does not bring about healing, but sees that it is spreading in the limb without any effect: then one must cut off that limb as far as necessary to allow the patient to escape from death or the greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 The sign of this is when the limb turns black until it seems dead: that fire has burnt it or it becomes putrid after turning black: then one must cut off as far as necessary from where this rot spreads to the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Thus at the onset of this cut and similarly if the cause of putrefaction is from certain poisonous ointments such as those from sea scorpions, viper's venom, rattlesnake oil, and similar substances.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the putrefaction or blow is on a finger, then cut off that finger and do not leave any space of rotting so it can spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if this happens on the hand, then cut it off at its root and do not leave any space of putrefaction so that it may spread to the bifurcation (fork) of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if this advances there, then cut off at the elbow near its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 But if the putrefaction progresses and he sees it about the elbow: then that is death to the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond this treatment, there is no remedy from medicines.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And do the same for the foot when putrefaction advances into a toe: then cut it off near the knuckle; and if it reaches the arch of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 However, if it rises to the knee, then incise the shin near the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 But if the decay has now reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it, unless discharge and let the sick person die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting a limb or closing it is to tie the tendons at the bottom that you want to cut: and tie another tendon above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And let the servant stretch one tendon downward: and let another servant stretch a tendon upward to above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two tendons with Spatulum, until all the meat is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And you must place a linen cloth from all parts on the wound, and it should not touch with suture at the healthy spot: and let there be an added injury to the sick person, and a warm swelling.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 But if there is an internal bleeding while you work, then quickly cauterize the place: or put some powders that detach blood on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the injured limb with a matching tendon, and care for it until healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what has happened to the man in his foot, this is the same thing that I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Which is because it happened on his foot a blackening that resembles the burning of fire: and this decay first happens on its finger until it begins to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 So the man recovered from himself after he saw that decay was cutting into his limb with great force, which he found from pain and burning: and it cut near the joint, and healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed to him, that same decay happened on his hand's index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I had put over his hand from the medicines after cleaning his body; but the excess was not found, and it began to progress into another finger: until the corruption started in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 So he called me to make an incision in his hand; and I did not want it, hoping for a recovery from that excess; and also feared regarding death at the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 For the man was strong overcoming adversity.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 And afterward he had tried on me, returned to his land; and came to me about it, because he hurried, and injured his whole hand: and was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring this account, except as assistance on what falls from the nature of this disease; and to signify its meaning, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Of the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in certain fleshly members and the space of the abscess is protracted, until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates, and what was in it escapes as if from a vessel; and the skin that is over it becomes like a cloth which has already been thinned out; and it does not reach its own corruption's end, nor imprint on the mouth, nor on the nerves, nor on the ligaments: it must be called Sinus. And it is not named Fistula. However, if the space of his continues to be protracted until it imprints a corruption in something among those members, then it will be named Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And the treatment of it is to incise that skin altogether as if one were peeling; and especially when thinned out like fabric: and trusting because it does not stick with its location due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If indeed you hope that it clings to the skin, and this does not result in that final corruption through its progression: and if there is a thickening of flesh in the wound, then treat it with an enema; and consider applying a plaster on it.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 If it is large and the pus that emanates from it has a foul odor: then enema it with an Egyptian medicine made of vinegard, oil, and ziniar, equal parts being taken together into a bottle; they are boiled over fire until the medicament turns red; and let it come to the thickening as honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is needed from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer the enema through that plaster; tighten the opening of it, and send the medicine into it for two hours' time.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract it with an irrigation: do this on that many days until the plaster is cleaned and the foul smell goes away.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes administer the enema with water and ashes, when this medicine is not available to you; it is that you take ash from wood shaveboard or oakwood ash: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then wash with it, and administer the enema with that; until you believe that the plaster is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 That if the sick person is not enduring of that Egyptian medicine, nor ash water; then enema it with water and honey, to which something has already been mixed in from crushed ziniar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or enema it with a mixture of honey and wine, because of the property of honey to cleanse and wash: and make the wine adhere to the plaster, especially when there is an excess in the wine of stiffness and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do that many times, and when you believe that the plaster is already free from corruption: then enema it with what makes flesh be born therein.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is as follows for receiving the emplastrum dafinicum: dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or clisterize it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 But if the passage of the Sinus is narrow and does not admit the clyster tube: then dilate it with iron to some extent: or place it into a poultice made with Egyptian ointum or Basillicum oil, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if it is also a passage that is wide, then unite its lips with stitches: and let the quantity drawn out from it be as much as to make up the clyster without anything added.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the passage from which pus flows is elevated to above, then cut it off at a lower spot on that place so that the peus runs upward: since when pus is compressed into the depths of Sinus, it prevents flesh from forming therein.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus somewhat lower as intended: then try to prepare the part with a preparation through which peus runs easily, according to what is convenient for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 And try that nothing at all be retained from the peus within it: and take solidifying remedies as prescribed above the mark, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the linen cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the entirety of the Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then incise with scissors along the opening of the Sinus hole, slightly larger than the Sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread with ointments of oil over another cloth according to the size of the hole: and place it over that place distant from the Sinus opening so as to ease the discharge of peus from there: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days alone.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 However, the one who is over the sinus opening, he is the one whom you should extract at all times so that what has accumulated in it due to pus; and to know whether the matter flowing from there is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And when considering this place of the sinus itself again, whether its lord feels pain there or not, and whether there is an abscess or not therein.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Therefore, when your treatment is extended thus, and you see the matter that flows over the sinus opening, then know if the sinus already adheres or approaches to adherence: then at once solve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you have bandaged the wound, then replace the cloth with another one, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 However, if a thin matter flows out of the sinus after a long period of time, do not despair from adherence, for its healing approaches because there are people who delay tissue generation in their wounds and others who act otherwise with it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 However, if matter flows out of the sinnus after many days of undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 But if adherence of the sinus is delayed and prolonged: then add in drying medicines, indeed make doctors so that there are medicines moist in substance and dry in power: as with the ointment dyafinicon when added to it excess humidity from honey.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the more recent treatment that is being administered as if you were to receive the dyafeinic ointment and it be dissolved with rose oil, and returned over old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then make it close up with that and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now he performs a similar action when the ointment of diphtheria is not present with you; honey, when boiled down, until it thickens, and uses that for treatment.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Take balm, oil of aloe, and frankincense; grind all together completely, and pound that powder over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then lay a strip over the wound, and press it with honey which you have boiled down; when thickened, grind that powder over it, and place it on the bandage, pressing it firmly.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes administered with that long plant [Aristolochia], roots of the heavenly lily, and wormwood; also barley flour and henbane.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them with simple or complex mixtures as ground; pound over honey which you have triturated, and use that for treatment.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the wound persists and does not heal by this treatment; then understand that there is a deep corruption within it; or already makes an impression on bones, or in other hard parts of the body, or ligaments: then cure it with the treatment of tube-like instruments, according to what was previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 About healing by means of panacea and filed nails, and incision on the added finger, and cutting.
Caput XCI.	 Head XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 A panarism is a suppuration that arises under the thumb nail of hand or foot; and perhaps it may arise in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 And when it is prolonged and not cared for by treatment, and becomes inflamed with warm suppuration; or when it rots away the root of the nail, producing pus until it corrodes the nail root: and sometimes it may rot away entirely, and perhaps reaches to the mouth, until there emanates a foul odor from it; and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color turns brown.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you are treating the body as we mentioned in the division, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you cut with iron all the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then burn the wound afterward.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For, indeed, burning is very useful for ulcers.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If however the bone is healthy, and even the nail is also healthamo, and loose additions of the nail already compress flesh to the interior, and begin to puncture it, and wound it: then you must place a fine radium under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it upward; and cut away the flesh with ease, and lay what remains from the meat on burning medicines, corrosive ones, until everything is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of that wound with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 But if the decay has already settled into the bone, then you must cut that bone and remove the flesh; for it cannot be healed as long as there is corruption in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 But if you see erosion and decay advancing into the finger, then cut it at one knot as mentioned earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of that wound until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 But if there is a loosening of the nail or a blow: and it causes severe pain in it, then you must first bleed the sick person with phlebotomy.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then dry the nail with sharp shavings of a spatula from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And watch out that the section does not reach the flesh under the nail; for you may cause a very sharp pain through it on the person sickened, and become the reason for growth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then take care of that place with whatever soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 However the finger that grows on certain people's hands, perhaps is fleshly throughout: and there may be bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail exists in it; and for some it originates at the joint root, or its birth is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, he who is born with certain knots on the finger does not move; and he who is born at the joint of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Thus, he who among them is fleshy has an easy amputation.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 That is, cut it near its root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the healing of one whose birth is at the joint's base is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it out.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 However, in the one who is born at the finger's end among knots, then it should be cut first by a round cutting to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then scrape the bone with one of those scrapers fitting for this.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 However, consolidation that occurs at the ends of the fingers often happens from birth itself (that is, born with it), or from consolidation of wounds, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, you should cut off that consolidation until the finger returns to its natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or soaked cloths in rose oil among them: to not consolidate quickly and separate between them; or put a thin sheet of lead between them, until the location heals according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly if a consolidation occurs at certain fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation according to what is prepared and fits the shape of the body part.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 § On Surgical Errors.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 There are enlarged veins that become twisted and full of excess melancholic humors occurring in many body parts: and the greatest discharge is from the legs, especially from the legs used for walking and working, and carrying.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black lethargy several times with strong vigor.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then the phlebotomist opens the veins of the patient.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 However, healing them with iron is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of these is to cauterize and extract the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And another way is to ligate the vein, and all [blood] drained out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 However, that cutting follows this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 The string is first with hot water much until the thick and dirty blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then the nurse ligates the leg of that string from the upper part of its hip to the lower part of its knee with threads.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then dry a piece at one place or two or three sections wide.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain it out (that is), draw the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and first the phlebotomist should treat the weakened one.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then dry a callus up to below (until) the amount of blood you see is sufficient and as much strength can endure (tolerate).
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards close (it), and instruct him to refrain from foods producing black lethargam and repeat evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and harm that sick one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 However, this draining follows this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the leg of the weakened if there are many hairs.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then insert the body into a bath or insert a string with hot water in that leg until it redden and swell (the veins), or exercise for strength if there is not present a bath for him until his limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then dry the skin on the veins' section lengthwise: or at its last part near the knee, or on its lower side by the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with a hook and peel it off from all sides until it appears to your sense of touch; and at its appearance, you see it turn red to black to green.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 Then when the skin is removed, you see it appear white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert something underneamoin it with the hook and gently remove it from the skin.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then dry another incision near that of three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then peel the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then remove it with radii as you did before and suspend it with another hook, just as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then dry another incision or more if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove it and make an incision on the last incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract it from above the incision.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this by extracting it from the higher incision or all higher incisions until completely out; then make an incision there.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 But if it does not submit to be extracted and removed: then insert a hook with strong wire twice the length, tie it, and extract that; or insert something underneath the Radium: and wrap your hand around every part until it is out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful so as not to cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is incised, then you will find it very difficult to remove entirely and the patient may be harmed by this injury.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have extracted it entirely: then place a bandage soaked in wine and rose oil or oil over the wound, and care for it until healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is contracted and has a curvature of its course to different parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then you should spread over it throughout the entire curve and places of its bending.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with a hook until it is completely dry; and do not strike against your cut so that you come upon it or wound yourself, for it will be difficult to smooth over or remove it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, use caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 Description of the case where a tendon is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of cataract.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It does not have the twisting as other catarcuas do, nor is it pointed at the ends, so that you may come upon it and be wounded; rather, it has a softness in bending: for if it were subtle, it would pierce with its own subtleness. In fact, it should have excessive bulk, as we mentioned earlier.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the removal of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter 93. (Note: This could be a chapter number
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated on the legs of warm lands, such as Egypt and the land of the Arabs, and on other warm but somewhat tender lands where nothing grows: neither grass nor trees. (Note: The provided Latin text seems to be discussing a geographical occurrence related to veins in the leg rather than an exact translation from Albucasis' medical texts.)
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs. (Note: The following Latin phrase, while not a direct quote or paraphrase from an original
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And indeed the formation of it is from decay that happens under the skin, such as occurs within bodies with snakes and roundworms (Ascaris) and worms formed between skin and flesh. (Note: This Latin text appears to be discussing a general concept related to medical conditions or parasites rather than a specific translation from Albucasis' works.)
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of this vein's occurrence is what happens with intense heat in the leg. (Note: This Latin phrase seems to be providing a symptom or diagnostic indication related to veins rather than an exact translation from Albucasis.)
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it becomes dry. (Note: The following Latin text is likely referring to a stage in the
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 And then begins the vein to emerge from that dried location, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal. (Note: This Latin phrase seems to be discussing a concept related to the physical manifestation of a medical condition rather than an exact translation from Albucasis' work
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 Therefore, when that extremity appears, you should wrap a piece of lead weighing the same as two silver coins and the object in question, then release it from above the wound.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something emerges from that area outside, wrap it with lead and the object in question.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it is greatly extended, then incise that part, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut at the root until it has completely emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 For if you cut, it tightens and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess to form, and festering at that location, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it must be gently handled and extracted gradually until it emerges from its end, leaving nothing behind in the body: and this vein exits at five handspans and ten in length in some people.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has reached me because it emerged from twenty handbreadths.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 But if you cut during the course of your treatment: then insert a rod into its opening, and make a hole through it for as long as there is material present in it; and apply festering to that area with appropriate medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then attend to treating the abscess itself.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint or within the foot itself; and there are many openings for it, from which a branch emerges.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore attend to its care, as we have said in the division, and with what was previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 § Regarding cutting above worms generated under the skin, which is called the illness of the bucks.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This illness is called the illness of bucks on our land, because it often happens to bucks; there is a small worm that is born between skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it goes through the entire body, ascending and descading; and is shown by its sense during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it disrupts in the skin area, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation comes from the putrefaction of some fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As happens with worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and roundworms inside the intestine.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it fears from its toxicity.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it itself goes into the body and ascends to the head, and arrivebs at a place: then perhaps it opens there, and emerges, and destroys an eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore when one knows how to care for it, and extract itself, then this does not happen except in its movement, and by its own sense appearance.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one should hold what is above it, and that which is below it with strong binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 But if it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find itself: then place a caustic over that area with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater is what fears from its corruption, which destroys the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 But if you see that it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then hold below it a good strapping on the brow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry over it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And it is necessary to use a weak cleansing of his body, with medicine dissolving fluids rotten and bad.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And he should beware from foods generating putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 § On the procedure for treating the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This illness is called in our land Nakir, and it is pain that happens to some limbs: then it is transferred from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed I have seen it myself, as I told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 Called to a certain woman who was sick at her house.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And he removed his arm, and I saw swelling along the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after remaining there for an hour, I saw one swelling advance with a worm-like motion, like a worm crawls; ascending to the arm faster than it could possibly be: as if it were silver alive when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore, the pain receded from that spot, and was fixed on the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was retreating throughout his whole body as I saw it.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, I am amazed at the speed of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed before that, I had not seen such an infirmity with my eyes in this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 But I did see many others who find pain changing from member to member; and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think it is anything else but because the woman was from those who are of dry body parts coming near: hence that changeable humidity appears to the sense.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are lustful and with moist bodies of uncovered parts.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Thus when you see his treatment and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye as we said, then bind above it tightly and quickly underne; and cut above it sharply until that compressed moisture comes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your own eyes: then care for it by shaking the body and using what drives out vapors; and use loathsome pellets and those of safflower, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Regarding the removal of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows vary according to their types and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 However, there is diversity among them: for some have large tips and small ones; and those that are hollowed-out, and hard.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are some which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And there are others with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And there are those which have stars (or celestite).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However, those that fall into the limbs do so in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For some limbs are hollowed-out from the main parts, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Whenever one of these limbs falls and you see signs of death, which I tell you afterward, then it is proper for you to use the method of extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in various dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when you do not see those bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For when an arrow falls into that limb where the skull is pierced and a subarachnoid (or cerebrospinal) fluid flows over the brain, these things happen because of it: sudden weakness, scotoma (blind spot), dizziness, reddening in the eyes, inflammation, redness of the tongue, spasms, and a mix-up of intellect; vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may come out from the nostrangs or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is severed, and voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And a white liquid like pus may come out from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And there comes forth from it a fluid similar to juicy flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 But if such signs appear to you, then refrain from healing, and extract the arrowhead if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 But signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are these: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels as though it were fixed in a hard thing, not in something hollow.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is movement of the arrow like a pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And follows that coldness in the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore, death approaches by no doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And a sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is that frothy blood flows from the wound; and the airways below the neck swell up and change the color of the sickly.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And one breathes out a large, deep spirit: and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 But if the arrow falls into a thin layer that is in the chest: then it is near the ribs: and there is great breathing with intense pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 But if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 But if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there: something of feces comes out from the wound or a small seed or an already torn intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope in curing it, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 But if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out of it: and something proceeds to the outside, and there is a stronger pain over the sickly: then know that it is lethal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, palate, shoulders of the back, furcula, hip, leg, and similar parts are healed in various ways when no arrow is found to have hit an artery or nerve, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you about the kind of these arrows that are meant for what lies beyond your healing method.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 What is it because an arrow fell into the tear duct of a certain man's eye at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I extracted it on one side under the fat of that ear, and he was healed, and nothing happened to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew that fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelabellum; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not pursue it except for a small hair of his beard which adhered to its wooden handle: and the arrow was large as arrows of the archers of the Turks with a mild iron without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew was healed, and nothing bad happened to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the kind that has ears (ears being small hook-like parts at both ends of some arrows).
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore, I followed on top between those two points: and it was already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 So I delicately dealt with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man's penis that had fallen into it: and we thought that he would die because of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 Afterward, however, after thirty days had passed and nothing changed in him regarding his conditions, I dealt with the arrow on top of it: and delicately removed it; and he was healed, and nothing bad happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw men whose wounds had been caused by an arrow hitting their backs, and the fracture was solidified over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 Therefore, seven years later, the arrow came out from the root of his hip bone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman whose womb was struck by an arrow, and the fracture had solidified over it, with the arrow remaining inside her: without any change in its condition, the woman found no harm from her natural processes or operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man whose face was struck by an tow arrow: the fracture had solidified, and it remained there without causing him much pain: and many such things occurred similarly.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's leaders, which had struck him on his nose and now was leaning slightly to the right side: and the arrow had been entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was therefore called for the treatment of his arrow wound, which lasted until three days afterward.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 And I found an arrow wound that had been very strictly tightened.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 And I examined it with fine touches and felt nothing: but indeed he himself found relief and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I therefore hoped that it was a puncture from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 So I applied the plaster to the place with a poultice that had attractive and digesting properties, relying on me confidently that it was aimed at a spot, and appeared to me as if there were an arrowhead above it: and nothing happened accidentally in that sign indicating that the arrow remained lodged.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 So I persisted with the poultice over him for many days: and nothing happened incidentally, and the fracture had solidified meanwhile: and he remained weak from his arrow extraction until one day when he felt the arrow in his nostril.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore, I applied medicine to that wound for many days until it opened up; and when I tried touching it, I felt the tip of an arrow barely sticking to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added more of the sharp medicine to the opening of the wnund, until we could see the tip of the arrow clearly; and it passed from me after approximately four months' time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then after the wound had grown larger and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and not allow it to exit: then I did not cease trying gently, and using various methods of ingenuity until one day with properly made forceps, as their form comes at the end of chapters, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore, I healed it and the wound was consolidated and his health was restored to full strength; nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: that you should put in place a rule and significance about what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 For the parts and distinctions of this art are not understood with its narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and a prudent craftsader compares little to much: and what is harmless compared to that which is absent: and he found a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of matters extraneous to this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that arrows do not leave from the members in which they are fixed, except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through attraction from where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 On the contrary side of the other.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which exits where it entered, or is a projectile going into a fleshy area: and it is drawn out, and exited.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not proceed to exit after the hour when it falls: then one should let it alone for several days until the flesh around it begins to rot: and its attraction is reduced, and its excretion.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it becomes embedded in the bone and does not obey you to exit, then let it be also for several days: and repeat it every day with its attraction and movement until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 That if it does not obey you to exit after the days, then one should puncture around the bone with a fine drill from all sides until the projectile is increased.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 But if the projectile is fixed in the skull bone and has now progressed into one of the brain ventricles, and some illnesses appear that I mentioned: then refrain from drawing the projectannoeht, and let it go, until its state equates after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if a projectile reaches the brain, then death is not protracted to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the projectile is not fixed, but only in bone bodies, and does not penetrate up to the brain: and remains sick for several days, and nothing of those illnesses happens to him: then use your intelligence with its attraction and removal.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 But if it is very fixed and does not obey you for its attraction: then use a drill around the projectile as I described before; then care for the place until healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 But if the projectile has already disappeared into a body location and is hidden from sight and sense: then probe it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 But if you feel it, then grasp it with certain instruments that correspond to its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 But if you cannot go over it due to the wound's constriction and the length of the arrow in deep: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein; then come upon it until the wound enlarges, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 But if there are ears through which it is held fast, then free the fixed flesh from all sides with every means you can; and devices, if it cannot be overcome by carneous defects in the bones of the ears and their twisting, until it withdraws.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you when administering the extraction of the Arrow, wherever it is located, then use the twisting of your hand with pliers on all sides until it withdraws: and with subtle delicacy, so that the Ar지트 is not broken, making its attraction difficult to you, and its own extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 But if you cannot go over it at once, then let it go for several days until the parts surrounding it rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then treat it again: for if the flow of blood hinders you, then apply what we have said from its cure in chapter itself: and guard your strength against cutting a vein, or a nerve, or a cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And apply every means you can to its arrow's withdrawal: and let it be with ease, calmness, delay, or firmness, as your narration tells you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that you do with the Arrow's extraction as though weakened according to its figure, according to how it was found at the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 For it has more juices.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if it is not possible for you to do so, then apply what is possible to you according to its forms.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 However, the arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part either immediately passes something to the exterior or causes a hump at the tip of the arrow due to sensation from the nearby skin, and you see it protrudebut cut off above it, and let there be a section according to the amount that can fit in it with forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it; for indeed this becomes easy to extract.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it remains lodged in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow impresses into the being, and widens itself; then pull out that one.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: dismiss it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 But if the arrow shaft is inside, then push it with that one.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the shaft falls and you are to administer a blow: then insert an instrument with a hollow end so that it enters into the butt of the arrow; then push it with that one.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 But if the arrow is hollowed out, then push it with an entering instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For indeed the arrow is extracted by this method.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must hollow out all the flesh wherein there is the venom; if possible to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for it with what suits that one's case.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 And if the arrow falls into the chest or in the bladamocheletorium or on the side; and it is near what you touch with your hands, and possible for you to cut above that one: then cut off the discharge from wound or nerves, and extract that one.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then tend a wound if it seems fitting, and care for it until healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps by which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 Let the ends resemble the beak of a bird, which have been made like iron: when they catch onto the arrowhead, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made into various types: large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrowhead, its sharpness, the width of the wound, and its tightness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of the impeller's cavity.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of the noise-making impeller.***(Please note that 'Impellent
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is like a bone's radius, to be inserted into the arrowhead's hollow and moved with it.***(Please note that 'Radius' here refers metaphorically to a part of an instrument resembling the shape or function of a radius; in medical context, this might suggest something cylindrical or barrel-like used for insertion.)*
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the hollowed impeller is like a bird's quill: to be inserted into the arrowhead and driven by it.***(This suggests that one end of the impeller device can fit into an arrow, much as a quill would enter a pen barrel.)*
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 Regarding venous bloodletting.***(A medieval surgical text might include guidance on how to safely remove blood from veins
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter XCVII.***(In medieval manuscripts, 'Cap
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 Veins for bloodletting, of which the common course through the body is thirty.***(This suggests a count or classification of veins commonly used or considered significant for therapeutic phlebotomy.)*
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of which sixteen are found in the head: two Pulsating Veins, located behind the ears and called Herbs; and two Arteries, visible on both temples; and two Vessels that run through the inner canals of each of the two eyes, known as Aspikants; and a prepared Vein in the middle of the forehead; and a Vessel at the end of the nose.***(This is a detailed description likely meant to guide medical practitioners in locating specific veins for bloodletting purposes.)*
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And two Guiding Veins, located in the neck.***(Guidegi here might be a term used to describe particular veins
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And two Vessels that are found above the lip of the mouth.***(This could refer to specific facial vessels targeted for thera groomings, medicinal
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And two vessels that are on the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 And these are called Arteria Labialis Inferior and Superior.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And two vessels that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 But the veins which are bled from the arms, there are five vessels in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is Cephalic, and it comes from the inner side; and people call it head's vein.
Et Fusca.	 And Black.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 And there is a Middle vessel, and it consists of the branch from the Basilica vein, and the branch from the Cephalic vein; and people call it body's vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And Basilica, and is located on the inner side of the arm; and is also called Wrist's Vein.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And people call it veins wrist.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And the Arm's Cord, and is located above the elbow; and it is there where bloodletting takes place, and that one appears with an obvious thumb movement.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And Salvaticula: and it is a vein which is between the Anularis and Minimi; and there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And three vessels exist in the thigh and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 One of them is which exists under the curvature of the thumb from the inner side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 And the second is Safeena; and its location is near the heel on the inner side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 And vessel Nessus; and its position is also near the heel from the inner side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And there are three other similar vessels in the thigh.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 § Regarding bloodletting of two vessels behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 However, the bloodletting of two vessels that are behind the ears is intended for ancient catarrhs, and hemicrania, and saffon's disease, and old sores on the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting it as I have described.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is done by rubbing the head of the sick person, and his occiput is massaged at the place where there are two veins with a good rough cloth rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick one is bound around the neck with wool and remains until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And these places are behind the ears, at two lower spots on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore ask for them with your finger, and where you feel a pulse under your finger, there mark it with wax painting.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the lance used for bloodlettcuing, which is called Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert its tip under the vein into the skin until it reaches with the lance to the mouth.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then hold your hand with the vein and skin towards the top, and incise the vein along with the skin using Incidens.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And the length of the incision should be as much as two fingers joined together or approximately that amount: and make it let out blood to its strength.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then bind it with bandages and release it until healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now I have finished the beginning of this book on making these incisiones and burnings.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 ¶ On bloodletting of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 However, the bloodletting of these two arteries that are in both temples is for ancient headaches: and nosebleeds; and frequent otitis; and excessive outpourings causing sharp pains to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the method of bloodletting these is as I will tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The sick one should bind their neck tightly until two veins appear by clear manifest vision: and shows the pulse under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then indeed make marks with wax painting.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then hold the skin and vein towards the top with your index finger, and insert Incidens from below, and hold the vein towards the top.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it as you did into two veins; and make it run with blood according to the necessity of your treatment.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then dissolve the tourniquet applied by the nurse, and place your finger on one vein.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then put a poultice and bruises over it, and tightly compress the area with strong binding; and release it once healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now let us recall those procedures, their incision, and extraction mentioned at the beginning of this book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 § On venipuncture on the forehead after cephalic vein phlebotomy.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 However, the bruising from venipuncture on the forehead is after cephalic vein phlebotomy for ancient facial illnesses; and headaches, and reddening of the skin; and foul sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the nature of that venipuncture is as follows: as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The patient should apply a tourniquet around their neck with veins until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take an instrument called the Fossoiron.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form: (Description of the tool should follow in a medieval Latin manuscript,
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place a prominent point that is at the top of Fossorium over the vein, and strike it over itself with a spatula or with another instrument similarly; and allow blood to flow according to the amount you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then dissolve the incision made by the patient, and tightly compress it until healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it opens with a wide venipuncture.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary for the phlebotomy to be of sharp ends, as are other venipunctures, but rather at wide ends.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the phlebotomy should be across it; for the bone is close by: and perhaps the venipuncture will break when it is too fine.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 § On venesection of veins in two lachrymal sacs.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 However, the juice of two veins that are in two lachrymal sacs for two eyes is due to scabies and redness: and runs into the eye, and face ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the nature of these venesections is that they tighten the sick man's neck with veins.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then perform those venesections: and you are standing over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And make the second venesection across length slightly, with a small venesection instrument, somewhat wide but not much, as there is no flesh at that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the venesection instrument is very delicate at the end, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let blood run as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place a compress over them and tighten them for one night, and loosen them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 § On venesection of the nose veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 However, the veins of the nose venesection are beneficial for acute fever and severe swelling, as well as facial ailments such as hemigranum, and redness that occurs on the face: especially when it is old (established).
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the nature of this venesection is to tighten the sick man's neck with veins.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a delicate and long venesection instrument: and fasten it there on the flesh of itself, between that which separates the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 For because the vein is not perceived by touch and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it should be that you finish with a slightly wide hand on the venesection instrument: and let blood run as much as your need requires.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind them for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 These themselves are quickly restored (heal).
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 On venous bloodletting according to the Ghāzi method.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 Of the two Ghāzi bloodletting methods, it is for shortness of breath, onset of leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo and ulcers, as well as destructive conditions such as worms of the herb ivy.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of these bloodlettangs is to bind the sick person under both with a tie on their neck; and for the craftsman to stand above the head of the sick person, and for the sick person to be sitting on his seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the bloodletting is made at a slightly greater length than usual bloodletting.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then one extracts a moderate amount of blood from the bloodletting, or according to that which is seen necessary in each case.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do similarly with other veins.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterwards dissolve the tie, and bind two middle veins; that is not overly constricted for the sick person.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And release it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound itself will heal.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 On venous bloodlettebt according to the Alberich method.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The veins of the Alberich bloodletting method are for providing relief from excessive alcohol consumption, gum disease, and ulcers; as well as fissures on the lips, and ulcers that occur in the nose or around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of these bloodlettings is to make the sick person sit facing you; and tie their neck with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then unroll the sick person's lip and look at two veins; one from their right lip, and the other from their left lip; and the indication for both is by the blackness of amber.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that's true because around those veins there are small, black vessels.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 So incise each one at the puncture site.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 However, if there is doubt about them and you do not know what they are: then proceed to the incision of the larger ones, and make them more evident.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly do this with the two veins that are on the upper lip; and it is indeed common practice to do so: and incise the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Regarding the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 However, the two veins that are under the tongue for phleebotomy provide relief: which is because the cephalic phlebotomy is for afflictions of the throat and ulcers, and illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is, that it should be weakened between your hands in the sunlight: and its root above the tongue, and look below the tongue on either vein side, and their colors turn to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore, phlebotome both; and guard, so that your hand does not cut too deeply while performing the phlebotomy on them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For under it are arteries, and perhaps bleeding may occur from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Regarding the three veins on the ankle.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are to be phlebotomized on the anculet are of which phlebotomy has been a common practice among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And the phlebotomy of these is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or by pricking with a wide lemon thorn: or to the subtleties of their color: or by cutting with a knife for shaving and is called Anesyl.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Alnesyl is, that it fits the incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from them are wide and subtle forms according to the width of veins and their narrowness: The form of a lemon thorn for phlebotomy is wide as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it suits for opening veins that are swolamoeba (swollen), filled, proceeding, appearing, thick, and those that contain bloody, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this fleam is of lesser width, and more delicate at the edges.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it suits for a fleam of fine veins that contain subtle lemon-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Regarding the Great Fleam.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 However, there is a single strength of these three kinds of vein fleams.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it extracts blood from ailments that are under the throat and neck, following what comes after the chest, and the windpipe: and it suits for the fleam to be cautious with it, as above is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If however it goes astray, and inserts into the fleam's puncture, it will hit that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, one should ensure not to use the fleam when puncturing with the fleam: indeed it is for cutting with Aalen's knife.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Great Fleam does not appear with a clear appearance, then one should seek out others and substitute it for another, or ask someone for its arm'culet of Brachio's vein.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 Indeed, she is clear to see, and cuts it with Aalen's knife, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If however you seek the fleam of its own self, then before constriction of Brachio's arm, one should touch to find out, until recognizing where the pulse is.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then signs over that place with wax, afterwards Brachio's arm, and cut the swollen vein section with Aalen's knife, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful not to let a stroke pass through the space from that place of an artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see that as you tie the bandage, there is swelling at the place marked with hot wax, then that swelling is of an artery; thus beware it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see the blood rise at the bleeding point as a child's urine and it is fine red blood, then you know it comes from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then be quick about it, and place your finger over the area for a while, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If therefore the blood is separated (for it is often separated), then bind up his arm tightly and let him rest; and warn him to avoid moving it: and be over that fear of his.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move him for several days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood does not separate and overwhs you: and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For his limbs are contracted, and the blood separates.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the skin of a sausage, and wrap it around him: receive half one piece, and bind it tightly over the place of bandage closure suitable, with a strip and cotton up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood separates, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not: then care for him with that of whom memory has flown from the place where dust was seen to separate blood; and separating his blood is not difficult in several dispositions because of the location of the wound, and possibility of bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 ¶ Concerning the bleeding from the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The veins of the dark bleeding are a flux that draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body: therefore, because it is composed of branches of the Basilica vein, and branches of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it suits the phlebotomist that there should be above fear from his bloodletting, for underneamo is nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if he adds to the bloodletting wound and finds nerves there, it results in stiffness, and its cure is difficult, and perhaps not fully cured.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 However, if it is hidden in certain people, and it is subtle, and not shown: then you should place your bloodletting with which to bloodlet them, a cut with Ancylolobus, and tear the nerves with strength of yours.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 What if the vein is between two nerves, then find it along the length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 § Regarding the head vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 But the bloodletting of cephalic veins is feared because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye afflictions.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is proper to do so in this vein if you wish, with bloodletting from the bloodletter olive or myrtle: for it is a cleanser of all veins, because there is not an artery nor nerve underneath.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it suits you with bloodletting from the bloodletter of the head of a single arm and seek a softer place: and it does not harm if not found by initial percussion, to pass over it again with occasional bloodletting.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps there is an ulcer in some people when not bloodletted by initial percussion, but it does not harm to that ulcer at all.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 § On the usefulness of Bloodletting and precautions to be observed therein.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 However, the quality of bloodletting and its occurrences from that, one should think about its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Therefore, you must first know that phlebotomy is not administeramoùd unless for the preservation of health and its continuity, and caution from the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And so that the phlebotomy is performed at one of three veins present on the elbow, namely the cephalic, and the fossa, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And that the phlebotomy is done at the beginning of spring during fasting, and summer, and fall, and winter after eating when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And that the phlebotomy is done on the first or third day, after three days have passed since passing hours.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, the phlebotomy that is administered for illnesses does not have a predetermined hour: but when it causes convenience and necessity to do so, at night or day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it is not necessary that children should undergo phlebotomy until they come of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman undergo phlebotomy unless from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 And neither should elderly people who have already passed sixty years undergo phculetomia.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, if anyone wishes to undergo phlebectomy for any reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with gentle purges, if there is much retained feces in them; so that veins do not attract from intestinal excesses through putrid and harmful fluids to the main limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 And neither should one who suffers from diarrhea, that is, vomiting due to nausea; nor a drunkard, nor someone recovering from drunkenness: until it has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor should the sick with dropsy (edema).
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And let phlebotomy be performed again after the passion of the colic, vomiting, discharge from the vagina, multiplication of coitus, labor and exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that weakened strength in either body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of the humors before this if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines; if it's possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter the bath unless something forbids it or exercise oneself with some activity to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place his phlebotomy on the chest as we have said; and strive that it be cleared of those ailments that day from all animal matters bad: such as narrowness, anger, fear: and from all bodily matters such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him make his own place be present with matters of which the custom of men has run on account of their sweetness, and fragrance, and dancing, and similar things to whatever extent is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit over a higher bed than that used for bloodletting; afterwards take out his arm and rub the phlebotomist with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligament with laces and wrap it twice around.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the bandage be moderate, for when the bandage is unequal or excessive on it, then it hinders the blood flow: or if it's too soft, then it also hinders the blood flow.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after the bandaging, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rubs with both hands at once until the veins swell and they are felt by touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then cleanse the phlebotomy with a little oil of its own kind.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on the vein itself where he wants to perform phlebotomy, a little lower: so that the vein does not escape and it is struck by percussion.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 For it is a vein as you found like an escaping chord near the phlebotomy: and among them there are those that are full of vitality: and when you place the lancet over it, it constricts under the lancet, and deceives the lancet operator, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is strict. Therefore, for this reason it must be ensured that the lancet operator is firm and vigilant in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then he should place down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If indeed a vein opens from one spot, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then repeat that at another place a little lower or above the same with haste: if there is no swelling.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 But if it becomes a pustule or the patient weakens, then dismiss him for one day, or two days: and do not bind the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 For perhaps the pustule is attracted by warmth.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Nor should he enter a bathhouse.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then he may proceed with the lancet if desired.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 That if the opening is small, or the blood runs thinly: and measure so that not too much blood leaves from the wound as desired: then repeat the lancet at the same opening following straightness, and add little by little in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this quickly, before the spot swells up, because a swollen place is among many people regarding a minor procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 But if you already see it as a pustule, then do not repeat at all on top of that, for nothing is excused by it with you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something from oil faeces over it: since it shortens the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better to use this than the oil itself, and than the remaining oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 Similarly, administer an oil enema in all your bloodletting; which stops the flow of blood during bleeding restrictions: and this is done with Tyrian purple dye, and saffron, when placed on one of them above the location.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood is then thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If this occurs at the site of a large abscess from bloodlettamoonts, which often happens, especially to those who have not been bloodlet but due to slight bleeding or opening of the veins, then quickly and place an infused sponge over the location with water and salt that is slightly heated: and squeeze it for a while; because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And you should do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself, with its own compliment, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 But if something remains in the place after a few days of blackness or greenish discoloration, it does not harm that: and if desired, put something like aloe or myrrh dissolvers over it; or something from peppermint juice, that is, its infusion or similar to that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at the bloodletting of the Basilicas.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore place your hand over it; then if you find softness at the pressure of your hand upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful therefore to put something on it like what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood flows from there through the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But do apply a plaster to it with that which has adhesiveness, so as to harden the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it together with the rest of the healing until it is cured.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And you should extract from every man blood according to the amount of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And it appears from the color of the running fluid above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then allow it to flow out until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thickened: then let it pass until it becomes thinner; and likewise, if it is sharp: then remove its sharpness.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it should be for one who is full, strong, and needs extraction of blood from a single vein, so that the venesection may be increased, and he must have wide phlebotomy; and conversely, for him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it should be done to extract the fluid from the veins and that there is a tight opening; and better what is given during venesection is that it has a cross-sectional section, not a pricking.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of venesection is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting nerves; and it is more commendable, and safer than venesection through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And for those who are accustomed to fainting with venesection, it should be that they eat a little bread soaked in grape juice before the small phlebotomy: or dried dates, if he is warm; and extract from him blood from three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if he has an undercooled complexion, then he should receive before the small phnlebotomy bread soaked in sweet wine, or in honeyed syrup with spices, or in aromatic and fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 But if it happens that there is fainting during the phlebotomy and its cause is a large amount of blood loss: then he should take watered meat juice, and subtile syrup; and use fragrant aromatics with spices, and rub his chest with them: and do what we have discussed in division syncopis by evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 However, if one wishes to treat their arm and release their blood a second time: it is suitable for him whose phlebotomy is due to evacuation of much, and his strength is weak, so that he releases blood gradually by the amount of his vitality over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 However, if one wishes to treat their arm and release their blood a second time, and his body is strong: then he should do so after seven hours or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 However, if one wishes to attract blood from his body to the opposite side where it declines: it is suitable for him to do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 However, if one's body already has a lot of heated and sharpened blood, causing fever to occur: it is suitable for him to let out some blood at once, and extract a large amount from it; and the opening should be amplified until fainting occurs: after you have been conserving all conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand over his pulse along the course of the blood flow, so that death does not occur in place of fainnishing.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For often it happens when the phlebotomist is unaware, and there is negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not suitable when one wishes to release their arm and blood a second time, while the orifice of the vein is already closed, making the blood's exit difficult, thus stretching overly quickly with force.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For that is a great evil, indeed cast it aside until he can be phlebotomized again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove with the sharpened phlebotomy that has coagulated blood in the vein's orifice and place something of dissolved salt on it in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place something of tila arboreum oil or saffron on it and apply a gentle pressure until the blood leaves.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If indeed a scab has formed there, then release it and do not cover it until the sore is settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If necessity requires draining blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either the actual lancet itself above that place or on another vein of the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The string of a lancse is located at the place called "Fusca," and "Basilica," when they are not found, and they are hidden because they are made from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of its lancet is that it allows a sick person to insert his hand into warm water until he easily bleeds and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then it is drawn over with a band of somewhat tight constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then it is secondarily drawn across gradually, not horizontally, nor along the length; and let its opening be wide, and let your lancet be over the joint of the hand but slightly.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 That if the flow of blood is forbidden, then repeatedly place your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if it be during summer days, then you are excused from placing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And especially the flow of blood is placed in warm water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this lancet's vein is a purifier for all veins since there are no arteries or nerves under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 The phlebotomy of the right hand called "Salvation" is attributed with healing liver afflictions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its lancet is that it draws strings with a band on the hand or your own hand after you insert it into warm water until the vein swells and shows very strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then secondly, let this lancet be drawn across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if it is cut completely through, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And let the vessel be closed so that you do not finish with a leech.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under it there are nerves of stripped fingers from flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then repeat your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood clots at the opening of the vessel and prevents flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 So when you extract the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on it so that it does not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, you should do this with every cut branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the leech's bandage on your left hand is: because it contributes to liver diseases: and similarly do its bloodletting as you did with the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 However, the bloodletting bandage of the saphenae leeches is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine illnesses, and retention of menstruation, and kidney weaknesses, and old ulcers on the hips and legs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of its bloodletting is that it inserts its weak foot into warm water: and makes friction over it until veins are full: and ties above with a bandage at the ankle joint.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And indeed the vein is located near the heel, appearing toward the thumb: and they branch out from it on many parts of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore do its bloodletting at a greater branch or near the heel among its swellings: because it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 Which if you do bloodletting with it on the foot face, then cut away from nerves which are underneath there on the foot's face.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your lancet where you want to make the incision with a turning motion, as if you wish to pierce it; and let the lanceb be Nepecin.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 However, if blood flow is prevented, then repeat the steps of immersing that limb in warm water; and let the blood drain out until it evacuates.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 What if the lancet does not work in the first attempt, then continue with phlebotomy near the top just slightly, for that is the safe place, and do not make any mischief when you cut from nerves as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the other saphenous vein of the foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the side of a bone called the talus.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the soothing agent for that lancet is to allecuate pain at anchor, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of that lancet is such that it incorporates infirm bathwater and has to act swiftly; and compresses the leg from the side of an anchor up to above the heel with four long strips, as it does not appear unless for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 Whenever it appears, then operate with that lancet as much as your ability allows or by a turning motion; and it is better to make an incision into it or cut it off.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For the place of it is safer, and that lancet is greatly hidden among many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 What if you do not find it and it does not appear at all to your sense: then operate with another branch of that lancet, which is the one appearing on the backside of the foot and toward the earlobe; and avoid cutting nerves, and make the blood flow out in a quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the swelling, and place a piece of skin over that lancet's location, and compress the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 Indeed, healing occurs quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 Regarding Vesicotomy, and its usage quality.
Caput XCVIII.	 Head LXXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Windy (crackling) sounds are made from the horns, metal, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And indeed, Vesicotope is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarification and bloodletting: the other method of windblowing without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this Windblowing which is without scarification, exists in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or indeed it is with heat.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without heat.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And windblowing that are administered with scarification and bloodletteing are fourteen parts of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 Of which one is Windblowing of the forehead (Alnocrati), and it is last on the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and windy guttural sounds from both sides simultaneously are two folds of the neck, each being parted off by the two halves together (Alachosos); and winds of the chin, which is below the lower jaw at the mouth's base: and windy of the two spoons; and windy Alasos above the end of the tail: and windy of both shanks, being in the middle of the upper arms (brachiorum); and windy of both legs (crurium), and windy guttural sounds from both calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And indeed Windblowing does not extract blood from you by applying a few small drops of oil spread thinly in the flesh, and therefore its strength does not leave it as is the case with that from bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 Nor is it appropriate for Windblowing to be administered whether with heat or without heat when any sickness occurs from the accumulation until all of the body has thinned out.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 Which if necessity incites it from sickness or due to the custom, we administer Windblowing at every hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle thereof, and whenever time may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 What is it because there are people who, when their blood increases much within them until they need its extraction through ventilation, find a swelling and hardness in the head of themselves?
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them is one who finds a fullness and redness on his face, in his head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them is one who finds itching on his face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in his own eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them is one who scratches the place of ventilation for himself.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them is one who finds a taste of blood in his mouth: or the tongue gets stuck, and spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them is one who sees blood and redness, corpses, wounds, and similar things in his sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from them and if it is properly in the third month of pregnancy: then we command that ventilation be done, after they have passed two hours or three days.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The uvula of ventilation is thus: because it causes heaviness in the head and what flows into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 But it should be that this occurs after evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And these indeed are in place of the cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not allowed to use that which has a cold constitution or where there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it brings great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this, it is not appropriate for them to use that which are old and where there are cold pains in the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 Whoever is overly persistent on it causes forgetfulness upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this, you should instruct the ventilator to lower his hand barely onto the underside, fearing a cause for forgetfulness from its generation.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 A ventosation or Alkahest is the location for dark venesection and Basilican venesecuing, and because of this it causes asthma, chest tightness, wheezing due to instrument fissures, and coughs with accumulation.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to drive the ventilation or Alkahest just enough because if placed lower, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosation indeed strengthens headaches, eye pains, half-head aches, punctures, tooth root pain; and it is the location for Basilican venesection.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And it is necessary to instruct the ventilator not to be too hasty with the scratching: so that he does not cut an artery and cause blood flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation under the chin strengthens pimples on the mouth and gum decay, along with similar illnesses found in the mouth; and it is the location for Alkeherych venesection, which are located in two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation of spoons strengthens Alkafakha, caused by choking and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Ventosation of the internal parts of two spoons strengthens the pains from venesection of three veins, Basilican, dark and cephalic: because these small channels draw blood from all those tiny vessels that are in the flesh; and they draw from other larger vessels until it reaches to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you should instruct the ventilator not to progress too much with scratching: because the location is naked flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventilation that covers above the Alkhauso strengthens anus hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you must instruct the use of the Suction Tub to be very powerful and that it is made of metal, since the place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate Suction Tubes may break: and a large incision should be made with an incision knife.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 However, the Suction Tubes reduce a clear decrease: for they draw blood from throughout the entire body and cause old pains in the kidneys, bladebeds, and bladders; they induce menstruation and bring about yawning, breathing; and are placed in the place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the Alhorcobeni Suction Tube is a close cousin of the Suction Tubes for both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the Ventosa position is to place the Suction Tubes first on a vacant area and draw out with tempered suction; and do not prolong the placement of the Su cups but put them quickly and remove them swiftly, so that fluids come to the place of entry equally: and do not cease performing this procedure repeatedly and continuously until you see the place turning red and becoming inflamed, and a sign of blood redness appears; then indeed perform an incision and gradually repeat the suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider the constitutions of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For those who are among men with tender flesh and rare skin folds, it should be incised only once, not more; so that the place may not become an ulcer.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the Suction Tubes to amplify the incision and make it shallow: and regulate the suction with ease, speed, and a gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 But if there is an increase of blood, then one should incise twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 Indeed, at first the bladder is opened to subtle blood thinning and hydration of it; and on the second occasion a thorough examination for extracting excessive blood occurs.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If indeed the blood is excessively foul, then a third incision should be made to achieve the final outcome.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And for the final stage, when we wish to draw out the blood gradually or in small amounts, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 But if we want to extract much blood, let us make multiple incisions through extensive incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to be incised through deep incisions: and an equal endpoint in incisions, is the depth of skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What that must be applied with oils near the location of winds, and what should soothe the wind.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In that very which has thick skin, hard, dark, and with narrow pores of it, must be greased the places Ventosare with open, mild, resolving oils: if in summer time, like oil of almonds, or squeezed oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil from pumpkin seebeans.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter time, then oil of daffodils, or oil from the lily, or chamomile oil, or saffron oil; and similar things to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 But if there is indeed a great excess, cold: then let oil of myrrh be, or oil from basilwort, or white oil, or oil of angelica; and similar things to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 But if wind-soothing is of wide pores and tender flesh: then it must be prohibited from oil, and these places Ventosare should be washed after wind-soothing with rosy water or cold water or solar water or pumpkin water or purslane water; and similar things to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 But that which has blood of much moisture, should be washed with wind-soothing by vinegar or wood apple water and sumac; and similar things to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 However, if these excesses are thick, he should wash them with his own vinegar or old wine, or with the juice of myrrh, or with a solution of nigella sativa, and similar substances.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary that the washing be done with a bath or in a foot bath, indeed it should be administerled after an hour from the bath or two hours later.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And one should not sleep after being washed.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is required to be treated for Sandarach or Flea Bite before the bathing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, you should consider firstly: if Sandarach or Flea Bite is hot-blooded and its severity and inflammation overcome blood; then it should receive cold treatments such as pomegranate syrup: and also vinegar with lettuce, sage, and yarrow, and similar substances.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place food that is easy to digest for him, cooked meats, and dishes seasoned with herbs. And similar substances.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And if his complexion is cold, he should drink syrup made of honey or almond milk, and sage syrup made from seeds; and let him drink aromatic wine that is medium between old and new: and advise him to eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And place food for him that is easy to digest such as roasted barley and chickpeas; and let him eat pigeons which are young birds and doves' chicks.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is necessary that the drink on the day of bathing and flea bite should be more than food; and let it be given in a drink to certain people at Tyrian alchemists' hours or medicine from musk, which is muscat: and before or after washing or flea bites: so that they may comfort their main body parts and thin out the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary to put them in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Of inflating without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Windy ones that are without incision, these are Ventosas placed over the ribs, and spleen, and podagram (podoconus), and over the windpipe, navel, and areas of the kidneys, and anchovy paste: since such body parts do not tolerate an incision on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them, except for an attachment from one blood vessel to another part of the body: such as we place a Ventosa over the nipples in the condition of a nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissipate cold, stagnant windiness from one body part into another: such as we place Ventosas over the windpipe and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For they thin out the body part, and warm it up, and drive away pain because they have resolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also it is placed over the kidneys when there occurs a distention or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 For perhaps the virtue of its attachment might open up the distention or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly it works when placed over the ribs and spleen to lessen windiness within both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And such Ventosas are administered only with a slight incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with heat.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered with a warm water-filled bladder for pleurisy: and that is to fill the Ventosa completely, so it's large, with hot water alone, or with water in which certain medicinal herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Shape of a Ventosa administered with heat.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The size of its opening is two fingers wide when opened up: and the depth should be half a palm deep: and it should have on one side an opening in the middle part where there are little openings, according to how much it will accommodate needles: made out of both copper and citrine, with thick margins, smooth, equal, polished: so as not to injure the body part at its placement over it: and a rod crossing through it in the middle, either from copper or iron, where one would place a candle with heat.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this strong and great boil is formed, larger than we have mentioned, yet slightly less than that one, according to the illnesses and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For these are veinous bores in children, and exhaustors for others, unlike those of men and heavy bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 However, the quality of placing this boil with fire upon a limb is such that you should light linen wax with fire neatly, or a small candle from beeswax: and place it over the transversely turned medium vein which lies in the middle of the boil, so that the fire would burn the lower part of the boe, but not consume the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it should be placed upon the limb, and a finger over the mentioned hole, until we hold the boil: as long as necessary, we remove the finger, and vapor will emerge from that hole, and immediately dissolve the boil.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then linen wax with fire according to its nature, and repeat it if you find such a thing again.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 However, the vein-like vent being administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, it is not a transversely turned vein, nor a hole: and it is not administered unless filled with water, and placed only upon the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this vent is better because it is much larger to take in a lot of water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Regarding the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Leechn do not administer in many limbs unless it is possible to place veinous bores there, because of their weaknesses, such as the lips and cheeks and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on an unclothed limb from flesh, such as fingers, noses, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is that you should come from leechangs which are in sweet waters and clean from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are sent off for a day and night in sweet water until they are hungry again, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is first bled with phlebotomy, and then purged by vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the wound carefully until it heals.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards, they place something on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 Therefore, they are filled and fall out, and it is possible to induce vomiting from the site with purging; then it is more appropriate for recovery: if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then they are bathed in plenty of water and rubbed, and expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood continues after a snakebite, and it is as if seeping out: then soak linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood is increased, then sprinkle the powdered ginger or alum on top of it and similar substances from plasters: until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or they are placed on top of half-peeled broad beans: and sent off until the peas stick to the place, because blood stops flowing.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if repetition is necessary for snakebites when possible, then move them away.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if they are forbidden from hanging, then the wound is cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or fix clay at the places until something comes out of blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they are placed on top because they stick immediately when they feel something from blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 Whenever it is desired for them to fall off, sprinkle on top a little of ground aloe or salt or ashes: and they immediately fall off.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 § The Second Ending.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 § Book of the Surgeon by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal words concerning restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torticollis, and similar conditions.
Caput I.	 Head I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This Chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine and concerns the restoration of bone fractures and dislocations resulting from accidents.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 You may know, my children, that some foolish doctors and the common people often dismiss this Chapter, especially those who have never examined an ancient book or read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method of healing has become secluded within our lands' sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never been involved with anything good in it at all, and I am not skilled in that method either, except for the length of reading ancient books and studying their knowledge until I extracted learning from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I cling to experimentation and study throughout my lifetime.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you all that is contained within this Chapter from my knowledge: and on top of what has passed as my experiment, after having abbreviated it for you, and liberating it from the burden of lengthy reading, and at the end of its abbreviation, and showing the end of decline: and I have formed many shapes in it similar to those forms instruments administered within it when added by a process of declination, just as I did in two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In summary, and selections from the essence of bone fractures, those preliminary stages that are necessary before we begin to recall individual broken and diverse bones, each one.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say at the beginning of this Chapter's preamble and headings that we think firstly about the understanding of an artisan stationed above their truth: so you may know, or others who are quick-witted learn this noble art from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when a fracture, dislocation, torsion, or accident occurs, one should first hurry to perform phlebotomy on him and let it bleed, or both together: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the person affected is a young child or an old decrepit man; or during times of extreme heat, or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then he should be content with his own food, cold vegetables and fatty meats, and lambs; and forbid wine, and heavy meats, and fill oneself with foods and all food that fills the blood vessels.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until when he is secure from the hot inflammation and there is no overflow of humors into the limb: then let him weakly return to his usual diet with which he was accustomed to run.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 But when the process of healing begins for the broken bone, it is necessary that the weakened person eat foods nourishing much nutrition, large and dense in which there are viscous substances; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, intestines of sugar cane, flour, fish recently caught: and thick wine, and similar to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 For indeed this treatment causes quicker coagulation of the fracture and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And you know that the bones broken when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to continue and strengthen according to their nature always, due to dryness of their limbs: and those from them which come to completion tenderness as the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature binds to the broken bone from all sides something similar to glue, which is density, with which it adheres and compresses him, until they are united at a time of coalescence, and tied by cohesion, until strength and firmness come in the end as was in the beginning, until nothing prevents them from his own operations: for this reason, it is necessary to place nourishing foods for the weakened person, with which there are density, viscosity, and largeness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And you know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a femur fracture is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a breastbone fracture is different from a dorsal bone fracture; and similarly all other limbs exist in various forms: and I come with a reminder that every species of fractures exposed in its own chapter distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the species of bone fractures also vary among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 For it is an arched fracture, besides little stars occur therein.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes it is a fracture along the length of the bone; and there are spikes from it, that is, little stars and extensions occurring as they do in a reed, when fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And there are not extending; and it is a fracture with a wound and separation at the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every species has its own skill or tool for its restoration as it comes to be remembered in its proper places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from this by which a bone fracture is known come its twistings and prominences; and its appearance to the sense, and sound it makes when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When however the twistings do not appear in a place and there is no sound with your touch when you press the bone with motion, nor does it give great pain to the weakened; then there is no fracture here at all, indeed possibly only a twisting or small fissure: so do not move it at all with your hand and pressure, rather place upon it remedies from which comes memory after that momentum which occurred in its place; then apply tight bandage carefully.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you should know that when the place is bent and cut into two, apart from what happens there, sores may occur; however, all of it must be removed as much as possible: then you should begin your hour for its correction, making it equal before a hot swelling occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 But if a hot sore happens to it, then let it be set aside for several days until the swelling subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then adjust it as much as possible by any means according to its softness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And you should know that the restoration of it, as well as its equalization, is easier than in bones where sores occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then bind it tightly according to what comes to your mind regarding it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 But if there are sores in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken body part from two sides, if hands or feet; with your hand alone, if a limb; or with two cords, or rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And your position in which you place the limb above an equal spot should be according to its natural shape; until when extending parts of a broken body part: then try by all means that those additions return as much as possible, and as you can in their places; and protect it carefully according to your strength so that pain does not occur from your operation on the weakened one or injury; and strive with your strength that you apply one of two bones together with its counterpart, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary in that hour to try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 But if you see something different there, correct it, and make it equal by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And be careful with a strong stretching and a firm pressing, as many ignorant people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often it happens from their own operation a hot sore or contraction on the limb: as we have already seen that many times from those operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then connect after the adjustment, and continue with the procedure, and the straining of that limb, and rest, and calmness; and advise the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And let him lie still, not to move at the time of his waking hours, and during sleep, and agitation, and excretion, and all movements in his final strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And he should be cautious that there is no position where following pain occurs.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 That is, because when he feels pain or injury in a certain position of the limb, then it should be changed to another position where he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And also, that the said position is equal and straight: so that there are no deformities in the limb when it heals.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the nature of the strained broken limb is as I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken bones vary in their strength, and in their size, and in their own shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 These therefore are small ones, like the arm and finger, and easy to manage, and similar things; then it should be wrapped with soft fabric.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 Those on the other hand are large ones, like the hip and leg; it should be wrapped with a wide fabric.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 For a broad ligament, binds the large limb, and holds it from all parts with an equal strain, so that no defect enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin after your evacuation with placing the appropriate ointment on the bandage over the place of its break.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin wrapping the bandage over the place of its break with three or four wrappings, according to how much it needs the limb; and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then proceed towards the upper part from the place of its break, and tighten less than your previous strain which you applied to the broken spot.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then lengthen it with slight curvature at the fracture site, gradually soften the tension, until you achieve a large portion of healthy tissue again.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another strip and wrap it once more over the fracture site with slight curves.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 After that, approach with slight curvature to the lower part of the fasterment.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be on the tightness and softening of it, as we mentioned earlier with the slight curve above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the slightly curved strips with stuffing or cloth so that it fits the twist of the fracture if there is a twist: and if not, do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then wrap over the other strip again.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then immediately place equitably over these slightly curved strips, if there is no swelling or hot sore at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or a hot sore: then place over it that which remains above the sore, and remove the swelling: and let it rest for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind tightly over those strips at that time.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the strips be of medium-sized cane, shaved and shaped wisely: or made from wood from which sieves are made, that is from pine, or rattan, namely palm branches or bark: and the size of all strips should be according to this form, and have the same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the strip placed over the injured part should be slightly thicker and wider than the others: and the length of the strip should be according to what fits the size and width of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind tightly over the strips with another band similarly as in the first tensioning.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then tie above with threads as we mentioned about the tightening: and it is that your tightening should be over the fracture site more than before: and how much further you lengthen from the fracture, the tighter the tightening will be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it is necessary that they are threads of medium thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of the surgeons in Persia who made their stitches from twisted flax strings, it is a great error: for the stricture falls with them out of quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And again fine threads do not fit: for you will not reach through the stricture what you wish to.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between two stitches.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 But if the patient is harmed by the edges of the stitches in healthy places after the stricture: then place under them from flax fibers or carded wool until nothing is damaged from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 And when a bone is broken and there is a rupture of the skin, I come with the recollection of that in chapter two on particulars.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And you know, not every broken bone must be bound with stitches from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 That is, that when the limb is large, it does not need to have stitches placed over it unless after five or seven days, or more, according to your security from warm swelling outbreaks.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the mode of plasters with which the ancients restored, that are placed over fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 ¶ The common mode of abbreviated emplastre, restoring fractures, suitable for several complexions, especially women and children: because it is placed on what does not succumb to heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the milling dust, and it is the bran of flour that hangs on the walls of the mill by the motion of the millstone; and prepare this as such, except that you strain the bran with the albugine: and place its preparation not thick nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it there.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method for emplastre is to fix a broken bone and treat dislocations or twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Recipe for almess and laudanum, and acacia, and enulae, and mugath; add the juice of all spices from X pieces of myrrh and balm, and with 5 parts of both aloes dissolve everything in alethil, or mix it with albugine if the patient's complexion is inflamed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this ointment there.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is a good mixture that quickly restores broken bones and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method for emplastre also strengthens fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Recipe for mugath and mess, and white of the Altaea; take the juice of all from X pieces of myrrh, and 5 parts of both aloes, and 6 parts boli armeni dilute everything with several washes, or crush it and mix with water, or albugine if inflamed: then administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 A method for emplastre to treat joints and bones dislocated from their places: it alleviates the pain caused by these conditions as well as fractures and bone splinters.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and boiled oil; place it over the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 However, in this ointment there is no power to restore; but it's beneficial for cooling boils and relieves pain directly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 A method of emplastre that heals broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the wild fig and bay leaf; dissolve everything in them to make an ointment from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 A method for emplastre used for healing broken bones; and when you want to dissolve remaining boils.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Recipe with the root of altea, and chamomile, and flowers' juices, and grain of a herb; take all in equal parts. Grind everything together and mix with wine, unless it is a heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If indeed it is a heated member, then prepare this with moist water of coriander or plain water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for a stronger plaster for dissolution as the first one when there is hard swelling near the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Recipe with the root of altea, and flax seeds, and balasore, and melilotus, and samsuce, and flowers' juices, and chamomile; take all in equal parts. Grind everything together and mix with water of willow or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 The entire preparation according to the warmth of the limb and its heat's calmness.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrangs indeed did not write in his book that something should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration except from cheese and oil; no other thing: and he tells it to be the mean between coarseness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen also seems to have thought that something should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration which has an accumulation of warmth, such as myrrh, and aloe and oud, and things similar to those I mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method for a plaster that is beneficial for injuries and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Recipe with poppy seeds, and beans, and cut hairs of a human head or feathers of birds, and altea, and equal parts of salt; grind everything together, sift it, and make an emplast from this.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity, as to what it should be so that there remains the bandage and then dissolve; consider when this does not happen in a sick person, neither do they feel pain nor is a broken bone moved from its place: then you shall not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If a strong itch or restless pain or swelling occurs there: then promptly wash out that place and remove the plaster; take linen cloth or marine sponge soaked in warm water, and immerse it on that spot until the itch ceases and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then leave the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place a bandage soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil over it, wrap it for one night, until you are sure of the heat's absence, and the swelling and pain of the limb cease.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with a mild strain and a plaster of dust: do not tighten the bandage too much at first, but gradually until healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the ulceration, redness, pain, swelling and all other conditions are entirely gone, and you find the plaster and bandage there: then repeat what you did initially evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of that which I mentioned happens to the limb: then do not wash it out unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is removed after nineteebough days entirely as appears from the state of the limb as I mentioned: until the fracture adheres and the tissue coagulates over it; then add also at that time more than your first bandage in bulkiness: and add also to the diet of the sick person according to his previous appetite.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see that the place of the fracture is already healed and thinned more than it should be: then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching there.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore treat it with warm water at the place where you wash it every day: and let that be for all three days, and Hallelujah to the light bandaging.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Therefore, by this surgical procedure, food reaches the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 However, the thing that ignorant restorers do from a limb's fracture elsewhere, when it is not restored properly at first and then restored improperly due to deformity, is an error from their surgery, and great fear: but if it were done right, they would have said so in their books, and they would have operated with that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see any of their traces at all in this matter, and it is better, so that such a thing does not happen.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 § About the construction of an accident on the head.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The types of fractures are diverse, and their shapes many: and the causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For a type of fracture is one that occurs from a blow with a tool; and the impact carries away the bone all the way to its end, which lies beneath another bacteria, as an ax does in wood: for this reason, this species of fractures is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or a tool strikes something within the bone and breaks its face, but does not penetrate the cut to its end: and this type of fracture is called Kala'an, which means complete breakage.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And a type of fracture is one that is worn or rubbed: and the cause is an impact with stone, or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this type of frupture is also penetrating, which now approaches the fold beneath the bone, or it is on the face of the bone: and it is a wound from these two types of fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And a type of fracture is one that is hidden subtly within the bone: and it is a small crack, and for this reason, this species of fractures is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among them is a fracture that occurs from an accident or by the impact of a stone, and similar ones that cause a sheet of bone to enter the interior, resulting in concavities: just as it happens with hot air balloons when they are struck and part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And indeed, this occurs most often in the bones of damp heads, as in children' very skulls.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And these types of splintered fractures are separated, and I come with the recollection of all that at its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these types of fractures through the detection above them, and examination with probes, and the removal of putrid flesh that lies over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 However, the capillary type is known by this, as it is detected over the bone and removed, and a bandage is applied to it with hot wax; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 However, in treating fractures, consider first the sickness caused by accidents: then if from the accidents you see things that mean clear signs of fear, such as vomiting cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and exiting eyes, and reddening of them, and similar things from many conditions caused by accorts, probably not healing: and if you see the accidents are not fearsome to you, and you hope for health: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is, if it comes to you wounded first with the wound: and this happens during winter days, then it is proper that you study in removing the bone before the fourteenth day of every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is during the days of summer, then it is necessary that you strive to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what lies undernewnail skin becomes rotten, and those things happen which I have narrated.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the bone fracture has already reached the panniculus near the brain and it is with small fragments and adhered: then one must cut the crushed and ground part as I have described to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is to scrape the head of the wounded one, and remove whatever you can from above the bone in any way possible according to the shape of the wound and what is easily removed over the weakened area.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If this happens to you during the examination of a bone with bleeding or hot suppuration: then apply what is necessary for it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is to fill the place with soaked bandages in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest, until the suppuration settles, and you are assured from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in treating the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 The method indeed is that you cut the bone with a sharp knife: and here is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then apply another knife after the blade of the first one, but only slightly wider: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then you also apply another knife even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 The second method is that you have a number of different knives with some being wider than others and some narrower to their respective ends: and they are made of iron forged or tempered: and use them easily in striking against the knife so as not to shake the head, and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 However, if the bangle is strong and hard: then it must be that you pierce around it before applying knives with terebras called non-deepening ones: and are not named so unless they do indeed penetrate through the end of the flesh into the bone behind it: therefore, because the terebra has a round tip above that which is below its sharp edge, similar margin, and a small circle prevents sinking, and passing through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it happens to you that you take from these trepanning instruments a great number, where each one corresponds to the thickness of the skull bone, until present are for you all craniums with trepanning tools: whose extremity's acuteness in length and width is, according to the thickness of that person'n crane.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of trepanning instruments, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of drilling into the circuit of a broken bone is: to place the trephine over the skull and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then switch the trephine to another place and position it where there is a quantity of thickness of the radius or about that much.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with incisors that is between every opening from the bone: and do it more subtly than you can over that above the fine thickness, as we said, until eradicate the bone, or your hand, or with another person's some instruments which you have set for this: such as tweezers, and delicate forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you handle with all care so that the trephine or incisor does not touch anything of a bone shard.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When therefore you circle the baboon around piercing and it has been separated from that continuum with it, and you extract it, it is necessary to scrape and level its remaining extremity with another similar tool as an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it must be thinner and more subtle than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of the small bones and fragments: then take them with ease, what is at hand among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linens, and ointments as we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of the operation is very easy, far removed from fear: which was said by Galen and praised him greatly, and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin by revealing a piece of bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed it under the tip of this Incisorius lenticularis, which is its shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lentiform part does not cut anything softly; and the sharp part of it flowing on both sides its length as you see: so that the lentiform part is attached to a hollow, facing the sharp edge towards the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike over the Incisor with a small hammer from one side: until you cut through the whole bvee easily as it turns back; and be assured by the skin, that nothing happens to it accidentally, which you fear greatly.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the healer were not a greater fool of humans and more ignorant, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the skin in certain places, it would cut that thing off with its tip of the Incisorius lenticularis itself, and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 For indeed, he is freed without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate up to the skin, and that which is cut off from the bone is its face, and remain in it roughness and delicate ridges: then you ought to scrape off that roughness, and remove those ridges with fine rasors from whom you prepared a number of diverse quantities for a long time, so that it may be possible for you to administer them appropriately at every suitable place, and rectify their direction according to the operation which leads you to the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary that you administer with reason on your part, especially where first the root of bone is wider than those cutters.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer instrument at that place.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do so in succession until you reach the stage where it can be administerired with thinner and more delicate instruments of all kinds.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In every small remaining cleft or furrow, and with a fine crack, it is necessary to administer care in accordance with what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a matter that does not remain hidden from all, which requires any study at all in this art, and stands out from what we have written, and shown in major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 But if the detected fatty layer remains, when you remove bone: then it is necessary to receive a linen bandage according to the amount of wounds, and immerse that part in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take a double or triple layer of cloth and immerse that part in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first bandage: and do what is possible more easily on top of that, so as not to disturb iffy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a wide bandage over that part: and do not tighten it, but only to the extent held by the wound itself: and let go of that care for one day or two days, until you are free from heat swelling.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then wash that part and administer with the medicines where there is excess dryness: such as lily roots, herb flour, thorn powder, aristolochia, and like it: and make a powder from these medicines to be powdered over the wound just as they are dried.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And generally administer all that medicine of which it has the property to repel and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And pour according to your power, so that the wound in your treatment may be clean: neither let there be dirt in the ointment, nor filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 And do not allow the virus to gather there at all: for when the virus gathers over the cerebral panniculum, it corrupts it and rots that flesh, and this happens after great mischief has befallen one who is already sickened; and now it occurs in a brain tumor, when it is cleansed by touching with the hand, especially if its care is neglected there.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Then consider when such things happen to a sick person, know that it seems very dangerous without doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if filthiness does not occur, unless from the medicine that is put upon it and in the power of that medicine, to make that filthiness: then one must receive a part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and wool mixed with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it over the tumor: afterwards take care of it with healing remed cups that are appropriate, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 ¶ Regarding the restoration of my nose when it breaks.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the upper two parts of the nose or one alone break; for these are two bones: because its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break and happens to it only by rubbing, twisting, and lopsidedness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts breaks, then it is fitting to insert a finger into the nose's hole and make that fracture even with your index finger and thumb, outwardly; until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let this be done skillfully, easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And pour carefully, so that it does not happen to painful sickness by your treatment.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If there is a break at the upper part of the nose and a finger does not reach it, then one must equalize the tip of the radius where the swelling is small.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 But if there are breaks in two parts, then do the same as that of it and hasten its restoration on the first day after the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then on the seventh or tenth day when there is a peaceful inflammation of heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a linen wedge into the tip of the nose if there is a break in one part: or insert two wedges if there are breaks in two parts: and let there be such an amount of swelling in the wedge that it fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some said by ancient restorers, to be infused with butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 However, that does not seem to me, indeed it is necessary, to be infused with the lye of eggshells, mixed when grounded into a fine powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then remove the wedge until the bone hardens and the cartilage toughens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the place of the wedge, after being soaked in softened linen: and it is that which holds the break in the nose more firmly, and prevents the sick from being hindered by breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want to do that: and if you want to use wedges.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 But if the nose is again inflamed with heat while you are working on it, apply plasters to the nose with wax or with a decoction of rose oil mixed with a little diaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if there is no inflammation with heat, then it is necessary to apply plasters with ground soapwort and a powder made from the lye of eggshells.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft plug on it and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of the nose are indeed broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut along them and remove the fragments with the appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then use a needle (surgical instrument), and take care to cover it with what is painted on it, and solidify it using appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If there is a wound on the nose, then it should be treated with dressings and you should administer a lead pipe until healed. (Note: The use of lead in historical medical practices has since been determined to be unsafe.)
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured. (In this case, more context would be required for a full translation related to surgical techniques or procedures from Albucasis.)
Caput V.	 Head V. (This seems to be an incomplete
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower junction of the mandible is disrupted and its break is not accompanied by a wound: examine if it is only fractured externally, and does not split into two pieces, and treat its internal aspects accordingly: then understanding of it is easy. (This sentence may be an incomplete or out-of-context fragment as provided.)
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if there is a break on the right part of it, insert the left index finger into the injured bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the right hand's index finger: and push outward the swelling from the top of the fracture with ease towards the outside using your other hand on the inner part of the bone evenly. (This instruction may be regarding manipulation techniques for treating jaw fractures.)
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it should be treated with external pressure from both sides according to its straightness: until equalization is possible. (This sentence could relate to post-reduction treatment of mandibular fractures.)
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If there is already an impact or disruption to the teeth: then hold them with wire from which you hope some remain using gold, silver, or thread (sinew). (This sentence may refer to stabilizing damaged teeth after trauma.)
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a compress over the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place two folded cloths over it, and another large piece of leather off-center: or a triangular piece of ox hide equal to the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it tightly as you have prepared the bandage for it, and apply it accordingly without causing damage; instruct the patient to rest in calmness and quietude; and place light food for its ingestion.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 However, if you judge that something of a different shape is emerging in any way: then promptly remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been altered from it and make plasters with lime paste, using either whitish clay or wheat flour, after you have removed the compress: and place a light cloth over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that dressing remains on it and the bone position does not change, let it heal without disturbance until cured; or if the break is severe.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For often this type of fracture takes three weeks to heal.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If during that time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often mentioned as necessary for its healing until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is an associated wound with the fracture, take into consideration: (followed by further advice that isn't provided here).
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if the fragment of bone has already separated or come loose: then carefully proceed with this, removing such fragments and any attached matter as you are accustomeed to remove them with instruments. (This implies a continuation that may include specific removal techniques).
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 However, if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it as needed with a cauterizing instrument according to your requirements: (which suggests further detailed instructions on how to safely and effectively manage such situations).
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 After you have removed those fragments and nothing remains of them, then close the wound if it is wide enough; or if not, place over it appropriate plasters that fit for this purpose, and cover it until healed: (here one would expect further guidance on dressing selection, application techniques, etc.).
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 On restoring the furcula when it is broken.
Caput VI.	 Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The furcula breaks most of all from the front part on the side of the humerus, and its fracture occurs in three kinds.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 For it breaks and is separated into two parts, except that this happens in the saddle: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or because of what occurs in the bone of the saddle: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or so that there is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation when there is a fracture without a ward, should be as follows: to have two assistants present, so that one can hold the support for the broken furcula and the other can stretch the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make an even break with your fingers until its shape is achieved as it should be: and that there be no protrusion or indentations.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 That if you require more extension, then it is fitting to place under an infirmary sphere made of cloth or wool: and its size according to your needs; and extend the furcula and compress the sphere with your hand until the fracture is even as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 That if you cannot pull the extremity of the furculatur to the outside because it has reached deep: then let the patient lie on his back and place under his humeral middle medium in size, and the lower assistant should support the arm; until the bone of the furcula that is deep comes upwards; and then correct the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If however you feel a hinge from the furcula and it is loose: then it should be closed over that area, and extracted with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If however it is retained in the bone, then insert your prepared teeth into that incision with one tooth at a time, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that keeps silence: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a spoon which has no dents.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And its width is according to the one you find from that size of bone and its thickness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 However, also its length as much as possible for your surgery.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 But if however the rupture of the wound that you cut when extracting the tooth from the bone is wide, and secure it from a hot splint: then join two lips of the walled with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the rupture is small, or with a hot splint: then fill the wound with bandages, and cotton according to the amount of the wound's tear.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 And if it happens with a hot splint: then pour bandage in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and put on top of that.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 The bandage however for the bone when there is no wound and without incision, is to put a plaster made of mill flour with egg white on top of it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a linen strip over that.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then put a compress under its ticklish spot if you find such one.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a hammock, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, very long: and its width one hand or about so much.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then put double cotton on top of the bandage and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl from a thin board whose width is three fingers, and similarly long.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then pierce it into the bandage.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then pierce the bandage with that awl at the place of the warm spot which falls over the fracture and area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the warm spot on the fancier as pierced and pierce it over its neck and at the sensitive and infirm ticklish spot: and reduce it over every part, and just as you see that the bandage holds the fracture appropriately, then it is such that it does not conceal itself above you, but fully, so that the awl on top of the fractured bone doesn't slip away.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 Therefore, it is necessary that one should examine the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Hence, when softening the ligament occurs, and you see that star move away: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then put the patient to sleep on his back and place undernecuccia near him at night, so that he may be relieved from pain by assistance from the side of himself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, let the ulna fracture be relieved through elongation of the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind the arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens by accident from itching or an abscess, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the poultice if you see his face to that part.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add a bandage and let it rest until he is recovered and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed the ulna is tightened and comforted as much as possible within eighteen days; and sometimes it happens that way in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 ¶ Regarding the healing of the spatula (ulna) fracture.
Caput VII.	 Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Seldom breaks the spatula (ulna), and in its wide place: and they do not break from it except for its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 Whenever it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and cannot be known by sight alone: then according to its figure attempt to prepare the fracture accordingly.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And restore it over its natural shape by every means possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the site poultice of powdered millstone with alabaster and a woolen plug, and over that put a poultice from doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on top of it a flat star from a delicate board according to the quantity of the whole spatula or somewhat smaller.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If indeed there are depressions under the stars at certain places, then that hollow should be smoothed with soft cotton until the star descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then apply compresses thickened with alkahest over it, properly bound, and securing the star'nature until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And attend to the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Therefore whenever the ligament is soothed, bind it and ensure that the star remains in its place; let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed the hollow must be restored in twenty days or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you should do so with caution.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is one of those bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dislocation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if it proceeds from a piece of broken bone, and punctures under the skin; then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we have said in the treatment of a furcule fracture from swelling with warm pus, if such should occur.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 § On restoring a breastbone fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest sometimes breaks in the middle, and rarely this happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Indeed, its extremities break very often, and crumble due to such accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When it breaks at its middle part that slopes downward, and a severe pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing ensues, and sometimes vomiting of blood happens, and swelling is declared in the fractured bone, and not hidden from sensation: Restoring it involves lying weakly on its back: and placing something between its wings like dust.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press its shoulders and connect the ribs from both sides with hands: and carefully adjust it according to every possible way that suits it, until the bone regains its shape as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place an ointment and plaster over it, and on top of that put a cast made from a board of fine wood, or linen, and similar ones for lightness, after you have wrapped it with cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then carefully attach it with a band over the broken beak so that it does not shift: and proceed along the curve of the back several times, and tighten the closure adequately.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bandage throughout every hour, and tighten it each time when it softens: and if need requires to solve its irritation at the site of pruritus, or corrosion that occurs in a place, or pain, or pustule: then quickly loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct what has happened according to the method of healing.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then make a poultice and if you see that it is necessary for his face; and bind it firmly until healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Regarding the restoration of fractures when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in thick places that follow the back and from its outer ends.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And there is no friction to them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of itself does not remain hidden from touch during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is made in such a way that an evenly broken rib with fingers as much as possible until it is healed into the shape that is appropriate.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then make poultices and bind the broken bone with wax if it needs them.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the fracture of the ribs is descending towards the interior; then it happens a severe pain in the sick person, and piercing as that which occurs to him who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures with wax, and also he suffers difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is a difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancient masters are already inventive in that with many devices: and there are those who say, to place food for the sick which generates inflammation and moistness, so that the throat may be inflamed, and extended, and driven out the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 However we dislike that there is no cause for making a warm abscess unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 But if it already happens, then add to that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them have said: place moistness on the spot, then suck it out with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, he fears that the moistness will attract excesses towards the spot due to the weakening of the positioning.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: It should be covered with the spot that is already submerged in warm oil; and grains are placed between the stitches, until it is filled; so that it may form an equal band when they open it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick man will be treated with a treatment of pleural tuberculosis from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 But if we are stricken with an intense illness that cannot be tolerated and the bone is pierced by the point of the drill causing us to fear for him: then it is necessary that we cut above the place, and reveal the broken stitches.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we will place over it the tool that saves life, whose memory has preceded: and we will cut the bangle with ease, and we will hit him.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we will gather two wound lips if it is large with a stitch: and we will treat it with plasters until healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 But if a hot sore happens meanwhile, then hurry, and pour grains into rose oil, and place over the spot; and treat the sick man with what suits him to the sore.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Also, he will lie on his side on which he sleeps until cured.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 ¶ Regarding the restoration of a spinal and neck fracture.
Caput X.	 Head X. (This seems to be an error
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Indeed, bones of the neck sometimes have a fracture, and rarely it happens with abrasion: similarly also for spinal processes.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 But when that happens to someone, and he knows whether it is cured or not: then you should trust him. (This seems like a very incomplete translation as the original text might have missing parts.)
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see his hands becoming softened and astonished and dead: and he cannot move them nor stretch them nor constrict them; and when you are binding them with your fingers, and piercing them with a point, he does not feel it at all, nor feels pain in them: then know that it is not cured, and in many dispositions is mortal. (This seems to be the continuation of an earlier translation which would make more sense when combined.)
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 What if you move them and feel a tightening with your fingers or pricking? Then you will know that the spine of the bone is healthy, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the spines of the back are similar to that one and you want to know if it will also be cured or not, then consider his feet: then if you see them softened, and this happens in their hands as well: then when he lies on his own back, effluvies and rags come out without desire; and when he turns over onto his stomach, rags come out without desire; and when he turns over onto his back again, and wants to urinate, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore no efforts are needed for its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If this indeed does not happen to him at all, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for him that happens from this is as you will hear in soothing an abscess with warm salves: thus, place oil of rose over a worn spine; or with goat's milk and barley meal.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on that several times a day until when the warm abscess subsides: then place one of comforting plasters, drawing out and binding tightly over it with a bandage; and instruct the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 And let him not sleep on the part where he found pain, until cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If this happens at the attrition of the jaw bone, or something that has already been separated from it: then you should scrape over the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather two lips of wounds, if they are large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 And then care for it with some healing ointment, until cured.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If indeed the bone is broken at its lowest end and reaches the tail end: then one must insert the left thumb into the anus, and with the other hand balance the broken bone as much as possible, and secondly in equal measure.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it upon the wound, and remove the wound itself; and treat the ulcer as with the treatment that preceded, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Regarding the restoration of a nail.
Caput XI.	 Head XII. (This appears to be an indic
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Oddly, bones of the ring finger are broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 But if they are broken, then the fracture of them is not present, only a comminution at their extremities; and they break along their length, leaning towards the interior; and in this case pain occurs where it breaks, as well as punctures, and the leg weakens.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And indeed its restoration is to extend your hand over it until you stabilize it in the shape that it has.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 But if the fanci is only broken at its extremities, then stabilize that fracture according to what has been prepared for you in proportion, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 But if the fanci is broken along its length or has already inclined towards the interior: then you must place the weakened over their belly until prepared for them restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 Whenever you have equalized it, place an ointment over it; then place a cast made of wood or skin on top of that and bind the area securely without fearing to change the position of the fracture nor remove the cast.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And the concaved ones along with what fills them should be equalized until bound securely in balance; and instruct the weakened to sleep on their back or healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 But if to him a warm abscess occurs: then he should stop extending it and its restoration until the abscess has subsided; then place on top of that what preceded, afterward return to his restoration: and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If indeed this occurs in a bone fracture or breakage, treat it externamo/externally.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 On the restoration of fractures as an assistant.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 Assistance is that which lies between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one or two methods/manners.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is: that you take a board flat in the middle thicknesses, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And they are bound with two ligatures at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is hung from an elevated place, and the sick person sits on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he should throw his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its nubiliformity; in the middle of which is attached the tenderniss of the wood/bone fragment.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then suspend something heavy from above him so that he may extend himself to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician shall equalize the fracture with his own hands at once until it is set correctly as needed/required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And the second method is that the sick person lies on his own back and suspends his hand from his neck with a ligament/tie.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then instruct two assistants that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands and that the other holds it below him, and each extends to their own side/part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for a stronger extension, then secure below the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament: and let each of the two assistants stretch to their own two parts/sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the fracture is near to the end of the shoulder blade, then it should be placed one ligament underneath its nubiliformity and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is near to the elbow: then it should be placed a ligament above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then correct the even fracture with ease and without effort, until when it is properly set as needed, and apply good bandaging; then bind it tightly, unless a hot swelling occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If indeed a hot swelling occurs, then loosen the binding until day seven.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place soaked woolen cloth in vinegar and rose oil upon it until the swelling ceases; then bind it tightly: and the manner of binding is to put a poultice over the function.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place an envelope from new cloth over the poultice.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm over it for support, and place his open hand over his own upper arm.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place another cloth and bind it tightly over the support arm so that the arm stands in its original position like stars; if nothing prevents you from doing this or changes anything on your side due to the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If this happens, which changes something on your side due to the broken bone, then use stars; and it is as placing over the broken bone a larger and stronger star than other remaining stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between every star the width of a finger: and let the length of stars be according to the broken bone with an additional three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind tightly over the stars as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is that your binding should be stricter than the place of the fracture itself.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And the more extended the fulture, let the binding be lesser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If however you see the position of the stars and the binding as we said, at once when you restore the limb, then do: and if a hot swelling occurs, then loosen the binding and the stars until day seven, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligament for all three days so that itching, swelling or food does not prevent entering into the limb due to an excess of binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore, correct it all, as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If indeed you are overconfident and something happens because of it: then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the sick person lie on their back, and place their hand over their stomach; and put a fully-filled woolen pad under support evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And pay attention at all hours of the night or day, that neither the shape of the broken limb is loosened nor softens the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore, correct it entirely with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And place food for the sick person according to the order we have mentioned, so that it is easily digestible first, until their mouth becomes tight; then it should be served them hearty food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom to tighten such a bandage for forty days: then indeed it should be loosened and bathed with a bath, and treated with ointments that heal it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 But if the fracture were severe, rubbed smoothly: then do not loosen from that bandage and screws until fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Of restoring a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones called the upper and lower shafts.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of which is short; that one follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is that which lies underneath below its lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, the larger one can be easily broken alone or together: so perhaps they both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore it breaks easily above, its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when it breaks easily below, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse when two bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the bone that is broken extends only slightly above it, then the physician makes sense to restore it by placing slight extensions with ease until they are equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if that which is broken is difficult and large: then one must place a very strong restriction.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand near its restoration, and extend it slightly above the swaddling clothes.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all other fingers; and let the joints below them or others be: and that which is weak sit on itself like a square, and have swaddling clothes before it, or directly to its height, so as not to incur any weakness in labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the assistant stretch the arm from its lower part with his own hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant extends similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician restores the bone until he can reduce it to as good a shape as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 That if in the break of the bones there are slivers, then try to reduce every fragment back into its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if it appears that the sliver is separated and stings the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration to you: then find over it, and remove it according to the method we mentioned above in those items which precede them.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if the break is with a wound: I have already made for that particular chapter, so therefore take its healing from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 That if a hot sore happens at the beginning of your restoration: then line cloth with wax made from rosy oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and fineness: and tighten the cloth over the slight restriction, until when the sore is settled: then remove the wax, and place a prepared plaster from ground pulverized molasses with albumin.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place stars and let the star to be placed on the actual fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of stars for the arm is six when they are arranged differently; whether it is a fracture in one bar or two bars together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your splint on the stronger and more severe area of the froidure, and somewhat higher or lower than that fracture: or place a softer splint on the same splint, slightly as was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let there be cloths that cover the fracture, soft and moist: and they are not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread used to bind it be from linen itself, of a thickness between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 And consider the limb and the ligament after several days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 But if something requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then one must wash the body with warm water until the itch subsides, and let the body not be bound, until it is rested; then repeat the splinting process.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 But if the splint has already become softer, and the bone has moved away, and others like it: then correct that whole thing with your strength again, and check it once more.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if the food is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of splinting: then let it be softened slightly, and release it for a few days until it reaches the food, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if none of these things occur as we have said in a weakened individual: then it is not necessary to dissolve it unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the sickly hand should be hanged at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be equal, and guarded by his strength against violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 And make him lie down on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture will be healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days and perhaps it will be healed in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 That is according to the temperaments of the body and the strengths of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ On mending of bone fractures.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the finger and knuckle joints rarely suffer from a fangs (fracture).
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen to him unless through frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 Whenever there is a fracture of the feet or through friction: then it must be that he be seated on his bed with equal support.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand over an extended object.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the assistant extends the broken bones and the healer unites them with good connection until when they come together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he apply a poultice and plaster unless there is not hot swelling (inflammation).
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the bale below according to the amount of space; and you have already covered it with linen fabric.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If however the fracture is at lower parts near to the sole of the feet, then make a similar sphere from linen cloth; and instruct the sick man to compress it with his broken foot part: then it is bound with long linen.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the sphere be of leather where there is tenderness, so that it may be applied with a skin along with the sole part of the foot; and bind it as it ought to be bound.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If however the faster is on the outside part, then it must be that you place the sphere from above and another sphere at the sole below: and let his hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put a bandage as if it was restored into the hand: and extend between the fingers with ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 That if there is a fracture of some finger joints, then if it is the thumb, be made as it ought to be made.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then it is bound with a splint: and if swolereness is present, place thereon a straight rod, small one; so that the fracture may be loosened, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 But if the fracture is in other fingers, such as middle, index, ring or little finger, then it should be aligned, and bound with a healthy finger that follows it; or all should be tied together according to their sequence: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place upon it a small rod as we said on the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And pay attention in your healing, and after the same arrangement of warm sores: and apply with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to how his account proceeds.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 ¶ Concerning the healing of a femur fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is often broken and declared as feeling pain; because it turns to the inner and back part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its healing happens thus: that above the fracture is tied a ligament, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the patient should stretch out over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then he extends all the ligaments with the help of the assistant to his own side according to balance: and this when there is a function in the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 But if there is a function near the hip root, then let there be a ligament to the side of the pubic bone, so that extension ascends: and another ligament below the frupture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And thus similarly if there is a function near the knee, then let there be a ligament close to the knee, so that extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician balances both bones with his own hands until he restores it to its natural shape: and the bone is joined by good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you place a plaster cast and a bandage, if no ulcer on the limb has occurred.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If this should happen with an abscess: then set it aside for a few days until the abscess becomes warm, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 But let that ligature be so placed.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to loop over the main bone fracture, that is, a bandage; and tie it twice or thrice: leaving some excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap around the leg until reaching the heel near the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper side of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then loop over the leg and hip with some excess left from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place above the hip at the site of its own stars and place one star above the bones of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then insert slacks between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that it is equal to the ligature.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with the strong ligature from the middle above the place of the function's three loops or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you lengthen more with the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your ligature be smaller and softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then move to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 So bind with three stars above them.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go out with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until reaching the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And also tighten both sides with star ends from one side: so that the ligature is not moved out of its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the ligature over that, as long as it stays, so that no damage occurs to the limb with corrosion, nor abscesses, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something should happen from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore be quick with the remedy of it and correct what has happened there entirely as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If indeed there is a piece of bone that hurts inside another bnch: then it must be made equal if possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, find above that and remove it; and take care with the one who preceded the memory, until healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this fracture of the hip is strangled; besides which they are added to him stars as we said in assistance and armament.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, when restoring it thusly broken, lameness does not occur.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if he is restored alone, besides applying to him another leg, then it is necessary that the one whose it is always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is strangled for fifty days, or added little, or lessened little; all of this depends on the diversity of complexions, and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 § On restoring the broken kneecap fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the kneecap fracture seldom happens to the knee joint, but it often happens there from friction many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If indeed it happens to him a fracture, then only or a crack, or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And that with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And it stands above all with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its restoration is as follows: it approaches what was broken from its parts with fingers, until it joins, and is connected according to what is possible by equality and ease, and craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then put an ointment made from flour of sesame or mill, with egg white: and place above that round astragalos if you find them: and tie the bandage upwards appropriately to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all dispositions that we have narrated in other fractures: such as hot suppuration, and like things; so that you oppose every accident to him according to what is appropriate for him, until healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On restoring a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the legs consist of two bones; one is thick and named cruris, while the other is slender and called femore.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And there occurs in both kinds of fractures that happen to two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done as with the arm's restoration equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 Which if both bones are broken simultaneously, the leg is restored to all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the slender bebone breaks, the leg is restored to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if the thick bone breaks, you will find it below: and it is from those that do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then apply extension, equalization, and the use of stakes as before equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 But it must be, if the leg fracture is a dirty break with many bloodshed: so let your extension be smaller and milder in reduction.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And concerning the leg there is somewhat of an operation on the arm: and it is as when you equalize stakes, and complete your entire operation, then take two layers from pine wood that are used in making glasses placed under boards; and make them with palm leaves: and choose those which have a small thickness, and not made of very fine grain; and their length should correspond to the length of the leg from knee to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then embroider on both layers with two stitches according to their length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg from one side and another from the other side: and they should be from knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie both layers in three places from two ends and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg tilts to the right and left, but remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 Indeed, it is now administered as a cradle from wood according to the length of the shank, and it should be placed there so that it holds itself by moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 Indeed, you must make this primarily when there is a wound with the break.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the shank every day and carefully observe its progress as well as lastly at the splinting or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If however something happens from these, then apply to it what is necessary, and see how he heals, as long as God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 Regarding the bone break of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 However, there is no complete break in the heel.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 However, there is a bone break of the foot sometimes, and also little breaks occur with the fingers: and it does not happen to them except through rubbing over many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 That if a bone break occurs in the foot, and you see those bones rising above themselves to the knee joint, then the sick person should place his foot on the prepared ground as standing.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand still and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones: afterwards press it, or strike with a stone; and make them even until they return to their places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply an ointment and a bandage on top: and place under the foot a thin board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then tie it with an appropriate bandage for the foot after you have warmed it with cloths and other things needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 However if three or four days pass to him, then dissolve the ligature.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find bones that are even, whether they are broken, or out of place.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore the operation is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If however some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even according to what you narrated to me about the restoration of the fingers on the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place an astrolabe beside your finger according to its length, and make it slightly wider: then place under the foot of this tablet which is convenient for you, and bind it with a proper bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If indeed that which is broken consists of two or three or more bones, then place the astrolabe above every finger according to its quantity, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the tablet at the foot's lower part: and let it stand on a headpiece of the tablet outside the foot'ebowel, so that it maintains good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is fitting for you not to forget, that you should consider all that I have said to you regarding the other broken bones from accidents which I mentioned: and apply remedy with what is appropriate for each case.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 ¶ Regarding the breaking of a woman's elbow, and the pelvis bone, and the groove in men.
Caput XIX.	 Head XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's elbow is broken, then make her sit straight.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then gently lean it towards the back of itself slightly, and let it be held backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then an experienced midwife fills her elbow's hollow with something until it is filled up: and let it be formed into the elbow as like a sphere as possible.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then shake the woman gently, and slowly ease her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For indeed that hollow is ejected, until it forms before the elbow's door like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a cushion over her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 But when she wishes to urinate, remove the hollow with ease, then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the method by which you first inserted it into her: then let it return to its original cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Do this for seven days or so, for indeed the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if it is a vein, receive the vein as a syringe and tighten above its opening with an ivory tube, and insert the entire syringe into its pouch.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the tube with force, until the vein enters the sack, for a rupture may occur.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it is filled with lead, and remains for several days, as we have described, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the pelvis breaks in men or women, then apply to its restoration, and that very equation we have described on the Ankyl cartilage.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not hidden that the rectum in such close fractures does not occur, which rarely happen, especially to those who are scholars or users.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand my book as much because the very fracture itself signifies to you many directions for restoration and strengthening of its own: therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 And when the rod of a man breaks, take the goose's throat: and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a swelling on top of it from cloth and let it swell up, and release after three days or so, and heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 § Regarding the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is fitting for him who has a fancied fracture with a wound, especially if it is large such as the hip bone or assistants, or like that one, as barbers, and immediately himself: if they testify to you about phlebotomy conditions, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 That if the wound flows blood, then you must as barbers make an incision there, so that powdered ashes are placed above it on a grindstone: if not present to you is anything else.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to repair the fracture on that same day, and do not delay it if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If indeed there is a hot abscess, then postpone the repair of it until the ninth day, when the abscess has settled down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third or fourth day at all, for by doing so you will cause harmful events to occur.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 However, if the broken bone is prominently detected through the skin: then you must discuss how to reduce it, and make it equal with your hands using small force and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 However, if the necessary reduction and equalization of it by your hands cannot be made: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And there is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length corresponds to the quantity of seven fingers or eight: and its width according to the extent of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And for this reason it is necessary that the doctor should receive from them three or four according to the quantity required by him for the treatment of the entire kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be round: and have a small thickness so that it does not double during the pressure above it at the time of surgery: and it should have sharp edges with an edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And it should be higher in size from half of itself to below.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is the shape of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that the sharp end of it should be bent over the prominent bone end: and push it with one thrust until when the bone returns and reaches an equal balance.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore, try to make the ends of the fabrication coincide.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 But if the ends of it are subtle and do not accept the instrument well, then you must be able to cut off the end of that bcheekbone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If indeed you cannot bring them back at all as we have described, then incise it with what is fitting from the cutting instruments that we mentioned: either saw off the piece entirely in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape away what remains on the bone due to roughness and small ridges.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 However, when the bone is reduced and it finds that thereafter a weakness caused by intense pain has occurred at the site of reduction, then know that the bone did not return to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Then do so.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you are healing a great weakness of the patient when completing the bone restoration that you make.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then soak the bandage in astringent wine, blackened.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And especially if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place a hot poultice over the wound, nor anything that may be an oil: so as to prevent it from becoming rotten and decaying.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then give casts at the time of completing your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And discharge the detected wound: thus, cut with scissors a hole in accordance with the size of the wound during healing.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And beware on all sides, that you do not bind the wound too tightly with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For indeed such things have often been done by these foolish physicians: and they caused it to happen unto their sick either death or decay or ulceration, that is, healing.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your bandaging be soft and gentle, different from the remaining bandages of most bone fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad, or it is a large wound, and there are some adverse events which we have narrated over it, and you find pain at the site of reduction: then it does not suit that you place casts over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make them incisions from tough fabrics at the place of stars, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But when it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above the fabric cloth that you placed on top of it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then apply lynchets and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds: such as the four-drug ointamoontment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And you should let yourself be loosened from the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And consider that every day in the morning and evening until it hardens and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it is necessary to prepare the limb so that the pus flows easily from above with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 Which if many wound days pass and it does not harden or the pus is separated from there: then you know that there are small bone pieces detached.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, one should examine the wound with touches.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 And how many of them are separated therefrom, remove those and extract it.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those of them that are not separated and bite the limb and cause pain to occur, try to fall upon it, and remove it in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 And if the wound becomes purulent or gangrenous, that is, an ulcer, or other kinds of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each of them with what suits him from his cure, as described in his own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from this matter in which my speech should stand and to whom you make your present mind when the bone breaks, and projects over the limb, such as the hipbone, and helpers, and similar ones from large limbs, it is that you do not assume its attraction, indeed many times death occurs from there: therefore dismiss it until putrefaction.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps indeed it may fall off by itself in forty or ninety days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then therefore care for the wound if you think so; and otherwise dismiss it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Of curing of a lump due to a sign of fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 2n.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Oftentimes it happens that this lump occurs as a sign of healing fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Particularly, those near the joints; and they swell due to such a shape of limbs.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the member from its natural movement.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Consider then if the lump is recent: apply to it remedies which have astringency, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, and resin, and acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, as you receive some of these or all of them: and make them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vineger: and place them on the lump using gauze, and bind them over the proper bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And loosen the dressing, do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then unbind it, and make another one, until the lump is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind over the same plate of lead not centrally.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 Lead indeed is a property to remove all that which fears from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the lump has already turned into a stone, and is bandaged, and urgently causes need to remove it: then cut over it from its upper part, and incise any excess protrusion: or scrape it with certain rasors until it is removed: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Of curing when restored, and remains the limb after that subtle, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 2n.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When the bone fracture is healed and remains a limb after that weakened: then it does not occur for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 Of these one is the abundance of ligament and its bandaging not as it should be: either because of the excessive tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or because of the superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the sickly and weak body.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The treatment for that is feeding the sick and making its body tender until the blood increases within it.
Et administra balneum.	 And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And introduce joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place the plaster on the limb, so that it attracts a large amount of nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And regularly apply embrocation to his wound with warm water until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 § Regarding the treatment of bones when they are healing in a crooked manner.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a limb that has been restored after its healing presents with tortuosity and protrusion of the fractured bone, or knotting: and it is deformed in shape, but nevertheless does not prevent the limb from carrying out its natural function: then it should not be necessary to receive its speech which is believed, that the limb may break again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done it on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And indeed this operation is highly blameworthy, leading to death or causing great fear, as it may clearly be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the limping and knotting are recent: then it should be treated with a poultice of warm water in which soaked herbs that soften have been boiled, such as leaves of comfrey, its root, and mallows, along with similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And make a poultice for him from soothing ointment, such as the one made with Dyabron.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Therefore, take some gum resin from the root of yarrow and shake it with goose fat or sesame oil; then apply it as a poultice with that substance.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Therefore, collect the juicy figs and crush them with white chalk of pigeons; such like remedies which they call from their medicines that reduce hardening.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the knot is looswed by frequent, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And it should be administered movement of the limb to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 But if there has already been a twist, and it is strong, and turned into a stone, and the need for its cure arises with iron: then one should cut above that part, and continuous bone tissue should be loosened and something superfluous from the knot or bone with fine incisions should be removed; and it should be administered flexibility in that area with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Of speech about dislocation. (Note: The Latin word "sermo" usually means a conversation or discussion, but
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV. (In the context of translating from medieval Latin
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is an outcome where some joints are out of their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it is forbidden from its own movement and spoils the shape of the limb. (Note: The Latin verb "prohibeo" means I prevent or prohibit.)
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes intense pain to occur on the afflicted and severe injuries. (The Latin word "accido" can mean happen or befall when used in a passive sense.)
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Whenever therefore it happens to someone the dislocation, then one should hurry for its restoration: do not delay it at all. (Note: "oportet" is a modal verb used in classical Latin that means "it's necessary," and here implies urgency.)
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if delayed, the place gets stuck, and perhaps with it reduction of dislocation cannot be achieved. (Note: The Latin verb "astraho" means to distend or pull apart.)
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 For this reason it is not necessary that one should move, nor be stretched at the hour of its sticking out. (Note: "mouere" comes from "moveo," which means to move or stir in Latin.)
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Since it often happens that a spasm occurs and hurts.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when this happens, you must be prepared to perform phlebotomy as the nurse.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it is dismissed until the abscess rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Next, the limb shall be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And each limb is to be cared for as the situation dictates.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have indeed already outlined chapters on luxations, even according to what has preceded in the case of a fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower parts.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 § On treating mandibular dislocations.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 2n.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 Chapter 53. Rarely are both lower jaws dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the displacement of fractures occurs in two different forms.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or rather they are slightly moved from their places and heal insufficiently.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are completely dislocated until healed to the chest part, while clear saliva flows from it and cannot hold it, nor can close his own mouth, and is unable to articulate with his tongue speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When however the displacement of that is slight, then it returns to multiple dispositions by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If however the displacement is complete and whole: then it should be administered reduction immediately, and not delayed indefinitely: and as to hold the head of patient: and the doctor inserts one hand into the root of the jaw fracture with his thumb if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he inserts two hands at once if the discription is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, which he calms down.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And you command the patient to clean their jaws and absolve them for eating with all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the doctor calms down the jaw, and pushes it until returning to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 Which if difficult is the reduction of it, especially if both jaws are together: then he administers evaporation with warm water and oil until making the dislocation easy to reduce: nor let the reductions be delayed at all, as we mentioned earlier.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When however they return and are evened out, and the mouth of patient is closed but not healed: then place oilcloths on them made from wax mixed with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is bound tightly with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let sleep be upon the patient'amoeba on his back; and his head to stand between two pillows so that he does not move it to the right or left: nor should he be compelled or urged to chew something: indeed, his food intake should be gentle, until when pains subside and jaw nods: then let him eat what he wants, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He should not work during the mouth surgery's eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw nods, and heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some time and do not return to their places: then often from that fever comes, and persistent sweating: and perhaps the sick patient's throat dissolves, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 But when you see that: then you know it is a loss, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 ¶ About reducing the dislocation of the elbow, and the end of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 Indeed, the furcula does not dislocate from its inner side due to its continuous nature with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And sometimes it dislocates outward: and that is felt.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And its restoration is such that the sick person lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then compress the place with your strong hand, because it will return itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then put something on top of that plaster, and pillows, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, its following extremities, which continue with the elbow, do not dislocate unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it becomes dislocated on some day: then it must be reduced and healed according to what we have said, and that you should prepare for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place on the same plaster, and ointment, and bandage it tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the patient to rest in peace and calm until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the end of the humerus is reduced; when separated again from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Regarding the reduction of Humerus dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter amoebic dysentery.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humer ous is not dislocated unless by three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of which is such that it is dislocated to the lower extremity (or) downward.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second one is so that it is dislocated to the chest side (or) toward.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus; and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it does not dislocate toward the back (or) rear due to the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it does not dislocate towards the front (or) ahead because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed mostly it is dislocated and comes out to the lower side toward the armpit: especially in those whose flesh (or) meats are few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 For they come out quickly, and enter back quickly (in them).
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is much, the contrary happens, namely that it comes out with difficulty and enters back with difficulty (or) difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some men by blows or falls, and the humer ous is inflamed with a warm swelling (or) edema, and is thought for this reason because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you should try to find out (or) test that until with certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment (or) healing.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And the dislocation is known when it is to the lower side toward the armpit; and distinguished between a dislocated humer ous and an uninjured (or) sound humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you found among them an obvious difference, and in the head of the humer ous there is a hollowing (or) concavity, and under the touch of the armpit the head of the humerus seems to be its own bone: and the patient cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 Similarly, if it is displauted towards the chest or upwards; then you find a noticeable touch, which does not remain hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And indeed, this type of dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is done by having the physician place his hand on top.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under its tickle and strengthen the joint upwards to its position; and let the physician stretch his hand upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then set it lower, for indeed it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return as we have said, and the dislocation has been present for several days: then one should bathe the weak child in warm water, and apply an embrocation that soothes and relieves, such as when boiling roots of altea, fenugreek, and mellilotus are poured into the water, and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then lie down the weak child on his back: and place under its tickle a sphere and wool that are equal in terms of softness and tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician places his heel over the sphere, and gently lifts the head of the humerus with strength, and pulls the hand of the weak child downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another physician holds the head of the weak child so that it does not move downwards; for indeed it returns immediately by itself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you can, reduce it according to this method: and do as when there are longer men present who stand on the side, and insert their humerus under the tickle of the weak child: and let them gently lift its tickle upwards until the weak child is suspended in air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another physician pulls the hand of the weak child downwards towards his chest.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the weak child is lightweight: then one should hang him with something else that makes noise: for indeed the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 Moreover, it is also done another way: and it consists of a figure resembling a long piece of wood on the ground, whose head has a round shape; like the neck of a jar: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then it should be placed under the patient after they have been positioned on top of the head of the wood: and the sick person stands according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is extended towards the lower part on one side, and the body is stretched out from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If it is difficult to reduce him through all the things we have mentioned, then use this method of care: and it consists of a wood whose length equals the quantity of two arms, and its width equals the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness equals the quantity of two fingers; which has a round head that alleviates the entrance to the depths of the wound according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then strips are tied above the round head with soft cloth so as not to harm the sick wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then it should be placed under the wound with the patient, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood to the lower part: and the wood is tied above the support and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then an arm should be placed over the step of the ladder across its width: and the hand is extended to the lower part, and the rest of the hanging body is left from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For indeed the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Whenever it is finished according to whatever possible way: then you should place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity of soft woolen.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place an applied plaster made from the powder of a millstone with olive oil, and apply white lead over the entire upper arm, as it healed upwardly.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tighten a decent bandage under the wound: and let the joint heal upward above the plaster: and connect its hand to its neck, and leave it so that his hand is not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary to place food for a limp-footed patient until the limb is strengthened, as it hastens its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let it be placed larger for seven or five days and begin moving again gradually.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If however the joint is dislocated many times due to moisture that has occurred there or for another reason: then it must be administeramoed with a caustic ointment having three holes, as described in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done completely and the ligament dissolves after seven days, and the joint does not come together, and the bandage is reduced several times but does not solidify, and it falls off, and cannot be elevated upwards: then you know that the nerves of its head are already cut, extended or softened: and you know that the joint will never return to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 However, dislocations that occur towards the chest and nipple, or a posterior reduction, occur with pushing and extension using hands: until it returns, and apply on them remaining bandages and care until healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If that happens after healing a heaviness occurs in the limb and a delay of its motion: then use lukewn water many times until it alleviates that heaviness, and returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Of treating an elbow dislocation. (Note: This is not part of the translation, but rather a heading or section
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28. (Again, this seems to be a
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that a cubital joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty as well: indeed, it can be dislocated to all parts, especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under sight and touch, however it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when joining a dislocated joint with a sound one, it is clearly declared to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For the joint has been bound, and the arm cannot be bent twice nor touched with its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you must quickly repair and reduce the dislocation before it turns into a hot swelling for him.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if this happens to be a hot swelling, it is difficult to reduce him: and perhaps he will not recover at all, especially when it is located toward the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For this kind of dislocation is worse in all types and they experience intense pain: and it often leads to their death with that condition.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration, when it can be reduced from them as possible, is, that their hand should be extended with two hands: and their arm should be expanded, and the doctor's hands should be above the elbow and below him, and he himself pushes the joint with his fingers at the same time or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is toward the front: then he returns in such a way that his hand doubles with his own hand until it hits the root of his palm elbow which was dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 For if the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then administer a strong and intense extension: and it is that two assistants extend his arm; and they hold him with both hands even as he should not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then his arm is returned to its entirety after it has been wrapped on top of his hand with a doubled long cloth or bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he anoints it with oil; that this is what helps in the smoothness of the joint and its ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the joint with a strong impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its reduction, it should be placed over the plaster, where there is swelling and pus formation, and a tight bandage is applied appropriatenebar.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the sick person for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it should be dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 But if therefore the joint is stiffened at its place, then dissolve the ligament from there and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then apply the plaster again and the bandage, and release it for several days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 But if, however, there is heaviness after the reduction of the joint and it remains in motion: then administer moisture during bathing, gentle friction, and compression, until it loosens or place over the joint of an olive ram, that is, sheep's milk pine.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bandage it, and leave it on top of it for one day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 But when then sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then apply over it olive oil three times, and secondly, and thirdly at the beginning of bathing until it loosens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you see, place over it swine dung, moist, heated with butter and bandage on top of it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For indeed it loosens, and returns to its position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that the speed of reducing such a dislocation occurs at the time when it happens, before the place becomes inflamed: or if an inflammableretains there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of such a dislocation is to place the weakened hand of the sick person on a table, and have an assistant extend their hand: and for the doctor to place his palm over the prominent joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already withdrawn into the hand: then have the sick person place their dorsum of the hand on a table during extension and reduction: and if the dislocation proceeds towards the back of the hand, then the position of that hand should be intrinsically placed over the table, that is to say, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table so that the doctor's hand falls on the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it therefore returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind it with a compressant ointment to reduce inflammation: and release it, without causing further damage.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it cannot be tolerated, nor can you go beyond the reduction of it after some days have passed, however, the joint remains according to its own tortuousness: and does not harm the sick person anything but that their hand is softened, and they cannot bind anything: then know that the nerves are either cut or abraded.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore it is not possible to manage this except by being cauterized near the location of its occurrence.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps that does not provide anything at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 But if the Mahassem does not return, then place this compress mentioned above on it.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then cauterize and release after five days: afterwards dissolve and release it again, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 But if there is a restriction of its movement and something serious happens to it: then gently wash with warm water and rubbing several times until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Section on the treatment of finger disloccuation.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated to any part or from its back towards the palm of your hand, or into that space: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the finger, hang it towards the side to which it was dislocated, and let it go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it, extend it, until it straightens on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When evening comes, secure the finger as mentioned above: and do not stop loosening it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and secure it again at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for several days until it tightens up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same with that if it is dislocated into the space of the hand: and secure it to its own side, and perform on it your first operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do likewise with that when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Section on the treatment of backbone disloccuation.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When this occurs with someone's backbone or complete neck dislocation or many vertebrae are displaced from their places: then there is no cure for it, as death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of that is that hunger causes the sick person to leave involuntarily and they cannot hold it: and often some parts of theirs are softened from this, or both legs of his, or both arms of his, or one of them; or a vertebra displaces from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For often it is displaced, because often such dislocation occurs in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 The one that displaces to the back is called kyphosis.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The treatment of that is to consider then if kyphosis occurs from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor complete recovery at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 However, in that case which occurs from an accident, or percussion, or similar things, the ancients have already said long treatments using a lengthy word.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Whose returns much less than profitable.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 However, I have already abbreviated it from there, which is little excused by its closeness to my intent: and from the explanation I gave of that, and forming that instrument in a different way than they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 So, what occurs from the swelling of the previous part, neither is an ability nor healing from that.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly for those occurring on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And they are not treated from them unless those occurring in the back properly, as I say: and it is that it should be stretched weak over its face on a level surface near the wall: and expanded under it a wet fabric so that it does not damage its chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight fixed wood should be placed in the hole on the ground at about its head end: and another piece of wood near its feet on the other end: and the servant to hold the wood, not tightened into the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And the other servant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then over the head of the weakened one, and under its tender tendons slightly tightened: and extend the end of that tendon to the wood which is at his head: and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then another tighten the tendons above its shoulders, and above its knees, and at its ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the tendons and bind them on the other wood which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then the servant extends all to the piece of wood tendon, and not removed from their places where they are fixed: but nevertheless, they should not be tightened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor places his hands on the spine with strength until it returns; or he places them over a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 However, if it does not return from this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three armspans.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And cut into the wall of which we mentioned that it is near the ailment, a space wherein the board can be inserted.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place a middle board over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the doctor places his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it tightly until the spine is constricted, and let it return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you wish, operate with a torque that has been traced with your hand; and it is as follows: make two pieces of wood on the ground near the head of the patient, whose length is one armspan each: and at the end of his feet, also two pieces ofwoo
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And the length between all pieces of wood is one handspan each; and now a hole has been made everywhere where the torque runs through: and secure every piece of wood firmly in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round piece of wood; and the torque is where the ligament runs through two holes in both pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the other end there is a hole wherein a piece of wood is secured whose length is one handspan as it returns; and with two other pieces of wood, likewise.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments you tied in the patient's chest to a torque that is near his head: and the ligaments you tied on its legs to a torque that is near its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand at all torques, the assistant who ties his hand with a ligament as it returns to the torque; and the doctor straightens the spine according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of a thorn, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, after Spondilus returns and the place is equated, you must apply an imbued plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then apply a supp. (suppository)
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Afterwards, place above the plaster an asterisk from a table, whose width is three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length and quantity should take up the space of a hunchback, and extend over the healthy part of Spondilus.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is bound with a band as we mentioned earlier.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the weak one should be nourished with subtle food until healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 And if anything remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is appropriate that they be administered medicines that soften and soothe, with the application tablet we mentioned during a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now one should administer with that lead plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes it happens that prominence is in the very last part of the back of Spondilus: and it should be thought to have dislocation through there, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it should not be thought of as with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death by chance.

Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the ankle and shoulder joints do not occur except as a mere dislocation: nor is it their case what happens with other remote joints due to slight displacement and depression.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed, the aneckle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This means that it is dislocated to the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And especially it is dislocated towards the inside: and little dislocated to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the cure for its dislocation towards the inside is: because when you connect a healthy leg with an infirm one, it becomes longer; and that knee protrudes more than sane, and the infirm cannot double his foot against his groin; and there is a place that follows the inflamed swelling of the inguinal region, for this reason because the hip joint has already arrived here.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of its external displacement is that they are opposite occurrences to these incidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of its displacement to the front part is that it expands a healthy leg according to the complementary measure: however, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot go beyond that on the front part: and his urine remains retained, and swelling occurs at the groin of his body, and there is walking difficulty on his heel during ambulation.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of its displacement to the back part is that it does not expand the knee, nor can it double itself before swelling occurs in the groin: and his leg becomes shorter on one side: and the groin is softened, and there is a headache at the location of the hip.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of these types of displacement is to consider that if the displacement is old, it has already aged along with the person who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its nature: then there is no treatment at all for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be assumed that this is completely resolved.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 However, if the displacement is recent and it belongs to one of the four species of dislocptions: then promptly do this, that you join its parts together, extend it internally and externally, move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it will return by itself, and will not need any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 However, if not by this method, then you should prepare a strong remedy, and extend its leg from the lower part: or with its own hands, or with a bandage that is tied over its leg above the knee: and another attendant extends his hand above it so as to insert his fingers under the ticklish parts of his body.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then he should tie with a gentle bandage over the root of the hip joint, and hold one end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the area of the foreskin, or from the back part to the area of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And its extension is all one piece until it detaches with its body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this kind of extension is a common type of the four kinds of extensions.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore there is a return to displacement with what we have said, it is good; if not, then it must be for every kind the specific treatment of that condition itself.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, in reducing its own when displacement is towards the inside, it should be laid on the firm'nourse 's healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a band over the hipbone, where it is between the head of the hip and under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligament upward from the front part of the groin to the higher part of the body, toward the foreskin area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong assistant should take his arms, and reduce the swolled area of the hip of the patient, and stretch it towards the outside extension vigorously.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now therefore returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this kind is an easier of the other treatment methods by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If however is excused from above and does not obey you at all with this kind of treatment method: then it should be that two feet 's are tied together simultaneously with a band strong, gentle over the heels, and over the two knees; and the length of each be equal to four times as many fingers. And the sick leg extended is more than another amount by twice two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then hang 's body over the head of the beam that is in the house: and its length from the ground be an amount twice two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to defend the head of the hip: and hang another with 's infirm body that you find; and one other young man pushes while defending the hipcorners strongly, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 However, for its proper reduction, when there is an external dislocation, it should be placed on a bed with the patient lying down as we described for those having humpbacks.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And the suture of the ligament is done over its shank and on its chest properly.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two splints are placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then an additional splint is placed in the middle of his foot and fixed firmly: over which wet cloths are to be wrapped so as not to injure the patient; and it should stand between his thighs to prevent drawing towards the lower part during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then the assistant should fully extend their arm, and the physician should properly adjust with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If this is followed by reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place over the same board and press it as we mentioned for humpbacks, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it should be ensured that the patient lies on their healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it should be quickly extended for the patient's leg as we described above on the bed; and the physician should place his right hand palm over the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then he should be bent with the other hand and placed extended towards the lower part of the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it should not be extended downward for the patient and he should lie on the ground; but rather, he should be placed on a hard surface as was said before when lying over his two humps: and it is on his face, with the ligaments extended as we have recently described.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it should be administered compression with a board even over the joint site to which the dislocation occurs upon completion of reduction as is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is as if you extend two legs of the sick person; and when you see that they are equal, and the sick person grips their leg, and expands them without excuse, then you know that the limb has returned according to how it should be; then join the two thighs, and place a bandage, and tighten with an unmoved wheel: so that it does not move towards any part; and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then dissolve the bandage and apply an emplastrum (dressing), and compare one leg with the other; then if you see that they are equal in their position, then you know that the dislocation has now been firmly set: therefore let the sick person walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softened: then undo it (the bandage), and apply that dressing again, and tighten that one according to your first strain; and let it also remain loose for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then undo it (the bandcuage) again and make the person rest from walking on both sides for two more days until well recovered.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Regarding knee dislocations.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to below (that is, to the back).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the sick person to apply their leg onto their own hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not adhere to the thigh: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all kinds of dislocations is that you make the sick person sit straight up so that now they can extend their leg if possible over it, and let their back adhere to your face; and place their foot among your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then attach your knee with its palms to his and position yours straight between his digits over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Next, apply with the palm of your hand both sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And let another servant stretch his foot until his knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of return is that the leg clings with the thigh in ease, not exertion.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then make a plaster and attach the leg to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Next, bind it together with linen for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Later, unbind it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And let the weak one not use walking for several days until healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 But if it refuses to be reduced by you, then provide strong extension with ligaments, as the procedure for ankle was described earlier, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 § For healing of calf displacement.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes thrown off by a slight push and sometimes dislocated according to the secondary method.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its displacement happens either towards the inside or the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you see an inflamed heel proceeding to the side towards which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure for its displacement then consists of easy return: and it is to be extended with ease using hands and leveled until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 And for its cure when it is displaced according to the secondary method, you must make the weak one sit straight and let a strong servant firmly hold him from behind on his back, in the middle of himself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then you with your right hand hold his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the heel's place.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull his foot to yourself using your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Next, with two steps from the left.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then, with the left hand extended, and pushing the chest with the foot while bending the right leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice, as I have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the chest with your foot to the leg on one side, and you pull the saw.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If he therefore returns to one side or two according to this manner and sees the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure on him: for he himself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If however it is denied to you the return of him with that which I have told: then make the sick man lie on his back on the ground and drive a stake into the firm earth so that he may fall between his thighs: and now wrap cloth around him, so that he may not be hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then the attendant takes his thigh: afterwards extends with another foot of the attendant or with their hands or with a band that binds over the top of the leg.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then extends all attendants against the extension of their counterparts: and the stake stands between both thighangs to retain him so that his body is not drawn towards the lower part near the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with their hands and another attendant holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For dislocation returns with ease.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When however the dislocation returns and it is declared to you his health upon return: then place a plaster and bandage, and bind them tightly with strong bands, and tie his foot with a band towards the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is fitting that you examine or feel for the nerves which are above the heel posteriorly, so that there be no band pressing on them and hurting them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then release him for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 But if the band loosens, bind him again: then untie him on the third or fourth day: and forbid the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If indeed he wishes to walk before this space of time, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not be resolved upon it, and it will be corrupted, and it will not receive after that treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If he suffers a hot abscess: then one must administer to his rest in that which our story preceded elsewhere in treatment and rubbing, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Regarding the dislocation of toe bones, and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Head LXIV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be straightened when it has been displaced with minimal extension and without effort: indeed, this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If however the dislocation is in some knots of the back of the foot: then one must make him sit with his injured foot on an equal level of the ground or on a board: and it stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot over that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then the heel with your foot by force, until it returns, and you see that it is already levelled, and does not protrude.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his instep a board which takes the whole foot in two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a proper bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured in the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Regarding types of dislocations with ulcers or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 Head LXV.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When such a thing happens and you undertake its treatment and restoration, often death occurs many times: and because of this one should not presume in his treatment, which is of this kind, unless he is wise in the art, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor arrogant: and to use medicines that only calm hot sores for a long time: and to abandon him to divine judgement.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you hope or expect healing from ruin with ease of sickness, and where something appears to be hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore make the cutting out of that immediately at the beginning of the matter before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the member returns as we wish, then apply a treatment that calms abscesses and treat wounds with what is suitable for them from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If there is dislocation with fracture and it occurs that the bone fragments are separated, then try their removal, and do as we have said concerning simple illnesses from what has preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be cautious according to your virtue and guard yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has preceded my prediction for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you before your Creator and more lasting to your glory, and more healing of your body with them at the time of yours.
