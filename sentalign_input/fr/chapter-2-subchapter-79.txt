Of piercing the anus
Many children are born who do not have their anus pierced, instead it is blocked by a delicate membrane:
so the midwife must pierce that membrane with her finger, and not with a sharp spatula, and ensure she does not touch the lace;
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you fear it might close again, place a lead tube in the opening, and leave it for a few days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the bathroom.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or an abscess; then it must be cut: so it should be treated, as we have said with the lead tube.
