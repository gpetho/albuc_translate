Chapter 60.
On the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the section the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stones that require manual operation and incision.
And the stone formed in the bladder is specifically the one that is lodged in the bladder.
And I am describing it here with clear explanation and brevity.
So, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly occur in children; and the signs of this are that the urine expelled from the bladder looks like water in its clarity, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, often feels pain, and then it becomes erect; and with this, there is pain in the rectum at times.
And it is easier to cure in children up to the age of fourteen; but it is difficult to cure in the elderly.
But in young adults, the cure is intermediate because it is between these stages.
And in those cases where the stone is larger, the treatment is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
So, when we come to treat this, we must first cleanse the patient with a clyster to remove all filth from the bowels; because sometimes this filth prevents the stone from being discovered in the examination.
Then, the patient should be taken by the feet and shaken or moved downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes moves from a higher place.
Then have him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downward.
Then examine it thoroughly and completely from the outside.
So, if you feel the stone in the space, then proceed immediately with the incision.
And if you do not find it entirely by touch, then you should oil the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is an adult, and insert it into his rectum.
And search for the stone until it is under your finger.
And gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger and push it outward towards the place where you will make the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, lift the skin beneath the genitals towards the place where the incision will be made.
Then insert a well-made spatula, which has the following shape:
and cut in the area between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle but towards the left thigh; the incision should be over the stone, with your finger in the rectum, and make a transverse cut so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size needed for the stone to pass through, and no more, because your finger in the rectum will press the stone towards the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones have angles and edges, making their expulsion difficult.
And some stones are smooth, resembling an acorn, and are round, making their expulsion easy.
So if it is one with angles and edges, adjust in the incision.
And if it is not expelled this way, you need to use force, or press on it properly with an instrument similar to a file, to press on the stone without slipping; or use a fine curved instrument from below.
But if you cannot manage it this way, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you see bleeding, stop it by applying crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, first push them towards the neck of the bladder, then cut over it; then push a little further; and do the same if there are many more than two.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision, because one of two things will happen: either the patient will die or suffer from continuous urine leakage because the area cannot completely heal.
But try to expel it until it is out, or use forceps to break it into pieces and remove it.
So when you have completed the operation, fill the wound with a mixture of aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten it.
And place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, to prevent swelling.
Then lay the patient on his back and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When you untie it, wash the area with water and oil, and then treat it with diafinicon and diabasilicon ointments until it is healed.
But if in the wound there is a hot, burning, and corrosive swelling, and if it seems like blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urine flow (this is known by the discharge of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood, because if it remains, it will cause the bladder to decay and rot.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with anything else that is suitable for healing it until it is healed.
And during the whole treatment period, you must bind both thighs and apply the medicines over the area.
And if the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, blocking urine flow, treat it as I described before attempting surgery, because sometimes this treatment alone can avoid surgery; and I have already tested this method, which involves using a perforating iron tool shaped like this:
With a triangular, sharp tip, set in a wooden handle.
Then take a string, and tie it around the penis below the stone so it does not return to the bladder.
Next, insert the iron tool into the penis, perforating easily until the tool reaches the stone.
Then rotate the tool with your hand on the stone little by little, forcing the perforation until you penetrate the other side; the urine will be immediately released.
Then press your hand on the remaining part of the stone from outside the penis, because it will be broken and expelled with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
But if this treatment is not possible for some reason, then tie one string below the stone and another above it.
Then make an incision over the stone in the penis between the two ties.
Then extract the stone.
Then untie the bindings and clean the congealed blood that has formed in the wound.
The binding below the stone is only necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the one above is needed because when the string is untied after the stone's extraction, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you tie the string above, you pull the skin upwards, so it covers the wound as we have described.
