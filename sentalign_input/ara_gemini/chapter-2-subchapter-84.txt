Chapter eighty-four on the treatment of wounds/injuries/surgeries.
I have mentioned in the division of the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I mention here their treatment by hand and with medicines to perfection, so I say that wounds vary according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the place where the wound occurs, so the things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone or a cut from a sword or a knife, or a stab from a spear, a stick, or an arrow, and so on from many things.
As for the wounds according to the places of the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measurement and a law for all other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because the complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that whenever a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no bone fracture, you should look, and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and it has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling on the patient, then hasten and bleed him on the spot, and do not delay that, and draw blood from him according to his strength if there is no impediment to bleeding, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is slight, and let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded area, and warn the patient against fullness, drink, and coarse foods.
If there is an impediment to bleeding him, let him reduce his food, and not approach meat or drinks.
And apply to the wound, if a hot swelling occurs in it, cotton dipped in rose oil alone or with the drink that has astringency.
And if you are safe from the hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe to you shortly.
But if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it until it draws pus, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not meet with the bandages, then join it with sutures as I describe in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its hold is only in a small attachment, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that repair solid flesh in it instead of the skin, and order the patient to eat foods that have firmness, such as heads, porridges, and the like.
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and it does not stick to the bone, cut off all the putrefied part and discard it, then treat it.
If in these wounds there is an artery or a vein bleeding from it, and the blood has not stopped with the medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it, and if necessary, if what we mentioned does not help, cauterize it until the blood stops, and if these wounds are small and simple, then their matter is easy and simple, it is sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding before the air changes them.
The recipe for the powder is that one part of frankincense is taken, two parts of mastic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime, all are crushed and sifted, and the wound is packed with it, and it is tied tightly until it adheres to it well and clots with the blood, then you tie it from above with bandages and leave it, do not loosen it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not come off it until it heals.
And that lime alone may do it if you do not have frankincense and mastic, and it may also do this action by itself in many large wounds if its placement on it and its tightening are mastered, and the wounds are fresh with their blood as long as the air has not changed them.
But if the air has changed it somewhat, especially if it is in the summer time, then there is no meaning in putting this powder, so treat it as we mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments to it, or applying a porridge of barley flour made with water and honey until it draws pus, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is slight, then pull it with the forceps.
I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what is to be resumed.
In neck surgery,
If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple, but if it has cut a nerve or an artery from the neck, and if it is a nerve, there is no way but to avoid treating it with what constricts severely, such as verdigris, vitriol, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm, and nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs, and what you treat it with should be of emollient medicines such as quicklime washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or with rose oil, and tutty if it is also washed with fresh water, and all other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, use sutures or join its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a pocket has occurred in its bottom where pus has collected, then drain it in the lowest place in it.
If an artery has been cut in the wound and you find its blood bleeding, then sever it or tie it or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has cut some or all of the cartilage of the larynx, and the jugular veins are safe, then join the edges of the skin with sutures over the trachea, and do not touch the larynx, but straighten it and return it to its natural shape, then tighten it tightly and leave it for days, then treat it with ointments that have astringency and drying until it heals.
If the wound has affected the bone, then examine it, and if there are bone fragments in it, then extract them all or what is possible of them, and what you cannot, leave it until the wound putrefies and heals and its removal becomes easy.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that we described, and if bone putrefies in the wound and becomes a fistula, then treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter.
In surgery of the chest and between the shoulders,
If it is a stab wound from a spear or a knife, and you see that it has depth, then look, and if air comes out of it when the patient breathes, then know that it is a fatal wound, and if it has no depth and is fresh with its blood, then do not put the powder in it at first glance, and do not tighten it so that the blood does not get trapped in its depth and recoil to the heart and kill the patient, but put in it an attractive ointment and loosen it twice a day, and if you do not have an ointment, then put worn cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it of moisture, and let the patient sleep on the wound so that what collects in it flows out.
And if three days or more have passed for the wound, and the patient has not experienced any convulsions, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe, so treat it with bandaging and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If its healing is difficult and it constantly suppurates, then know that it has become a fistula, so treat it according to its chapter.
The patient should sleep on the wound so that what collects in it flows out.
And if time has passed for the wound of the chest or back, treat it with what has been mentioned of suturing if it is large, or with the powder if it is small.
If it has affected the bone and cut off fragments from it, then examine the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are free, and if they are not free, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for it will make their removal easier.
As for the rest of the wounds occurring in the rest of the organs, their rule in treatment is the rule of what we have mentioned.
