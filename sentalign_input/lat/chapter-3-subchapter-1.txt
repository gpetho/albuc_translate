Summaries and collections on the nature of bone fractures, among those whose knowledge is necessary before we begin the discussion of fractured and various members, if of each one.
Chapter 2.
It is necessary that we state in the prologue of this chapter the main points and headings, so that the practitioner is directed first to an understanding of their truth, so that you, and those who are eager, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, twist, or fall, it is necessary first to hasten to bloodletting and relaxing the patient, or both together, unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if the patient is a child or very old person, or if it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
Then be moderate in food, with cool vegetables and the meats of birds and kids; prohibit wine and heavy meats and foods that fill the veins with blood.
Until you are sure that there is no risk of hot swelling and do not fear the spreading of matter to a limb, then let the patient return to his original diet to which he is accustomed.
When the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary to feed the patient with nourishing foods that are substantial, thick, and heavy, with a certain viscosity, such as porridge made from wheat cooked with water, rice, heads, feet, and stomachs of cows, eggs, and fresh fish, along with thick wine and similar items.
With this regimen, the bone fracture consolidates more quickly and effectively.
And you should know that broken bones, when in men of advanced or very old age, cannot always rejoin and consolidate fully due to the dryness of their tissues; they consolidate and join in a less firm manner than those in young children.
Yet nature attaches something like glue on all sides of the broken bone, where there is thickness, so that it adheres and holds it, until the parts coalesce and bind together, restoring it to full strength and firmness as it was initially, until nothing hinders its function. For this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with food that is heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that types of fractures differ according to the diversity of body parts: a leg fracture is different from a skull fracture; a fracture of the chest bone differs from that of the spine; similarly, all remaining parts vary from one another. I will cover every type of fracture, each presented in its chapter, distinct from the others.
And the types of bone fractures themselves vary as well.
For sometimes it breaks in an arched manner, in addition to splintering.
Sometimes the bone fractures along its length; and it splinters into shards and projections, as in a reed when sharpened with a knife for writing.
Others do not project outward; there is the fracture with a wound and rupture in the skull, and a small fissure fracture.
Each type has its own method or tool for repair, which will be discussed in detail in its respective place.
One way to recognize a bone fracture is by its twisting, its prominence, its perceptible appearance, and the sound it makes when you press on it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the area, no sound at the touch when you move the bone, and the patient feels no great pain, then there is no fracture; it may be a twist or a small fissure. In such cases, avoid moving it or applying pressure at all. Instead, apply the suitable medications, which will be discussed later, and then bind it gently.
And know that when the place curves and splits into two, even if injuries happen there, nevertheless, each part is separated from its counterpart. Then it is necessary for you to begin immediately to set it straight, aligning it before a hot abscess forms there.
But if a hot abscess does form, then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides.
Then set it straight in whatever way you can, with gentleness and skill.
And know that the repair and alignment of it is easier than that of bone, in which injuries occur.
Then bind it, as it comes back to your memory.
If, however, there are dislocations in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from both sides, whether it be a hand or foot: with your hand if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb on a level place, in its natural shape, until the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try to restore those protrusions to their places by every means you can manage: and take care, with all your strength, that neither pain nor injury falls upon the patient due to your operation: and try, to the best of your ability, to apply one of the two bones to its companion, according to the best shapes.
And at that time, you must test and touch it with your hand.
If, therefore, you see something different there, set it straight and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of vigorous extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
For often they cause, by that operation of theirs, a hot abscess or a contraction in the limb, as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Then, after alignment, suitable operation, and securing of that limb, and rest, and tranquility, instruct the patient concerning it.
And make him be cautious, so that he does not move it during his waking hours, his sleep, his turning, his movements, his bowel movements, and all his motions, with all his strength.
And let him beware, lest the position of the limb be one that leads to pain.
That is, when he feels pain or injury in the positioning of the limb: then you must adjust it to another position in which he does not feel pain.
And beware with him, that its position is level and straight: so that there is no twisting in the limb when it heals.
And the nature of securing the broken limb is as I describe.
Know that broken limbs vary in their smallness, size, and shape.
Those of them which are small, like the arm, finger, shoulder blade, and similar, must be wrapped in a soft, thin cloth.
Those which are large, like the thigh and leg, must have a wide, hard wrapping.
For a wide bandage joins a large limb and binds it with even tightness on every side, so that no mark enters it.
Then begin, after your setting has been completed, to place a suitable dressing for it, in soft tow over the site of the fracture.
Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb deserves: and gently tighten with your hand along with the bandage.
Then move with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and bind it less tightly than your binding with which you secured the fracture site.
Then extend yourself with the wrapping slightly from the site of the fracture, and gradually loosen the binding, until you take a large section from the healthy area.
Then take another band, and wrap it again over the fractured site with wrappings.
Afterward, move with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture.
And let your operation in binding the wrapping and loosening it be as we said in the first wrapping above.
Then place between the wrappings some soft tow or cloth to balance any twisting in the fracture, if there is any twisting: and if not, do not put anything there.
Then wrap another band over it.
Afterward, place decently made splints over these wrappings at once, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the area.
If, however, there is swelling or an abscess: then place over it what soothes the abscess and reduces the swelling: and leave it for a few days.
Then bind the splints over it at that time.
And let the splints be from the halves of broad reeds, scraped and skillfully shaped: or be from wood used for making sieves, which come from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the size of each splint be according to this form and figure.
However, it is necessary that the splint placed over the actual fracture be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints: and the length of the splint should be appropriate to the size and smallness of the limb.
Then bind over the splints with another bandage, with the same tightness as the first one.
Then tie it decently above with threads, as we said regarding the tightness: and it is such that your binding is tighter over the site of the fracture: and the farther it is from the fracture, the looser the binding should be.
And the threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operations of fools who place their threads of twisted linen cords, it is a grave error: for with these the binding falls outside the quality needed.
And very thin threads also are not suitable: for you will not achieve with them the binding you desire.
And there should be no less than a finger's width between each splint.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after the binding in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow or carded wool, so that nothing is injured from it.
But when there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture happens in the skin, I will address it with recollection in a specific chapter.
And know that not every broken limb must be bound with splints on the first day.
This is because when a limb is large, splints should not be placed on it until after five days, or seven, or more, depending on your assurance against the occurrence of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients restored fractures and dislocations.
Â¶ Method of the common abbreviated plaster, restoring fractures, suitable for many constitutions, especially for women and children: for it is made from a material that neither heat nor cold overpowers.
And it is thus: take mill dust, which is the essence of flour that clings to the walls of the mill as the wheel turns: prepare it as it is, except sift it with egg white: and make the mixture neither thick nor thin.
Then use it.
Â¶ Another method of plaster, restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting.
Take almess, ladanum, acacia, elecampane, and mugath: and resin, each 10 drachms, myrrh, and aloe, each 5 drachms, and alethil 20 drachms; grind all, sift, and mix with alethil water: or with egg white if the patient's constitution is heated.
Then use this plaster.
For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
Â¶ Another method of plaster, which also aids fractures and twisting.
Take mugath, mess, and white mallow, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloe, each 5 drachms; acacia 6 drachms; Armenian clay 20 drachms; grind all thoroughly, sift, and mix with water or egg white: and apply.
Â¶ Method of plaster for joints and bones displaced from their places: it soothes the pain affecting them, a bone fissure, and a fracture.
Take raw wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil: and place it over the area.
And indeed in this plaster there is no restoring power, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it effectively relieves pain.
Â¶ Method of plaster, which restores broken bone.
Take the leaves of wild fig and wild poppy: grind all, and make a plaster from both.
Â¶ Method of abbreviated plaster, applied for the restoration of bone fracture: and when you want the resolution of a remaining abscess.
Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and herb flour, each one part: grind all, and mix with wine, if the limb is not heated.
But if it is heated, then prepare it with fresh coriander water, or with water, and use it.
On the method of a stronger plaster in loosening than the first one, when a hard swelling occurs at the restoration of a limb.
Take marshmallow root, linseed, pomegranate flower, melilot, elderflower, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each, grind them all, and prepare with willow water, or fresh water, or wine.
All of this is according to the warmth of the limb and the calm of its heat.
Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be applied to the fractured limb at its restoration except a caeretum made of wax and oil, nothing else, and he stated it should be of moderate thickness and thinness.
Galen, however, deemed it suitable to place on the fractured limb at its restoration substances with drying warmth, like myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar items among those we have described.
On the method of a plaster that helps with injury and pain.
Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpea, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt; grind them, sieve them, and prepare them into a plaster.
The duration for which the bandage should remain, then be loosened, is determined by observing whether the patient experiences no pain, no itching, and the fractured bone is not moved from its place; then do not loosen it for many days.
But if there occurs intense itching in the area, or disturbing pain, or swelling, then hurry and loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster from it; and take a soft cloth or a gentle sea sponge, dampen it, soak it in warm water, and wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain is soothed.
Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Then place fresh wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, over it, and bind it overnight until you are sure of being free from hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides and its pain is relieved.
Then reapply a light bandage and a small plaster; do not tighten it as you did at first, and apply gentle bandaging until it heals.
If you see that swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms are completely removed, and you need the plaster and bandage, then reapply it as you did at first, evenly.
If none of those things happen to the limb, then do not loosen it until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
And sometimes it is left for twenty days, all according to what appears to you upon loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates over it; then increase the tightness more than your initial bandage completely, and also increase the intake of nourishing food, as previously mentioned.
If, however, you see that the site of the fracture is becoming too dry and thin, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Therefore, moisten it with warm water every time you loosen it, and do this every three days, and ease the bandage slightly.
Through this operation, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
What foolish restorers do by setting the fracture improperly when it is not initially restored as it should be, and instead set it crookedly, is a mistake in their operation and a great danger; if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and worked with it.
And I have not seen any trace of this in any of their writings at all, and it is better that it not be done.
