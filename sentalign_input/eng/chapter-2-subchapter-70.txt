 CHAPTER SEVENTY.
On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
 There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes.
Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.
There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs.
These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.
This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.
As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.
