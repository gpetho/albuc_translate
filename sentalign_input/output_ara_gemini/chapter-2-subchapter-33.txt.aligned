Chapter thirty-three on joining loose molars with silver threads or with gold threads.	CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE. On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.	0.8603553
If the front molars become loose and move due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything edible lest they fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the treatment has not been successful	When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire.	0.70893997
then the trick is to tie them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains in its state forever and is not affected by that.	Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change.	0.7505158
The thread should be medium in thinness and thickness, as much as can fit between the molars.	The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.	0.7876164
And the method of tying is that you take the thread and insert its bend between the two healthy molars, then weave with the ends of the thread between the loose molars, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy molar on the other side, then you return the weaving to the side you started from.	The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.	0.8164156
And tighten your hand gently and wisely so that it does not move at all, and your tightening of the thread should be at the roots of the molars so that it does not escape.	You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip.	0.43253523
Then cut the ends of the excess thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with the husk, and hide them between the healthy molar and the loose molar so that they do not hurt the tongue. Then leave it tightened like this as long as it remains.	Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.	0.8165167
If it becomes loose or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and they will enjoy it like this for the rest of their life.	But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life.	0.77659476
This is a picture of the molars and the method of tying in two healthy molars and two loose molars, as you see.	This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.	0.8176765
And one or two teeth may return after falling out, to their places, and become fixed, as we have described, and remain.	After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent.	0.796178
And only a skilled and delicate craftsman does that.	This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner.	0.7764045
And he may carve bone from the bones of cattle, and make from it the shape of a tooth and place it in the location from which the tooth has gone, and fasten it as we have said, and it remains and benefits from that.	Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	0.73744833
