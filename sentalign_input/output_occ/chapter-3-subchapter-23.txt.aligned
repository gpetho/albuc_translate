On the discussion of dislocation.	Discourse on dislocations.	0.83932126
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, preventing movement, and deforming the shape of the limb, causing the patient great pain and injury.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.89365077
So when a dislocation happens to someone, it must be immediately forced back, and not delayed, because if delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and very soon it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all. For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.	0.81020105
Therefore, it should not be handled or stretched during the time of inflammation, because it often causes spasms and severe pain.	So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.9022856
But when this happens, you must quickly perform bloodletting on the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be treated with warm water and oil, and it will be easily reduced.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced.	0.8393585
And every limb should be treated with the remedies appropriate for it, as will be described in their respective chapters.	And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.643356
And I have already organized the chapters on dislocation as preceded by the chapters on fractures; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowest part.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.86544186
