Of the mandibles (jawbones)  
It is rare for both mandibles to be dislocated, and their dislocation occurs in two ways: either they are slightly out of place and somewhat loosened; or they are entirely dislocated, hanging towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth as it cannot be held, nor can the mouth be closed, and the tongue becomes entangled with speech.  
When the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place on its own.  
And if it is complete and severe, you must reduce it quickly without delay.  
In such a manner that the assistant holds the patient’s head, and the practitioner places his thumb inside the mouth at the root of the dislocation if it is on both sides; and the other fingers are outside, to align; and command the patient to relax the mandibles and move them in all directions.  
And the practitioner aligns it until it returns to its place.  
And if it is difficult to reduce, especially if both mandibles are dislocated together, then bathe them with warm water and oil until they can be gently put back in place; do not delay in reducing, as we have said.  
And when they are equally reduced, and the patient’s mouth closes well without difficulty, apply cloths soaked in a mixture of rose oil and wax, then bind lightly with soft ties.  
And let the patient sleep on his back, with his head supported between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left, and does not strain to chew, but takes light food until the pains are gone, and the mandibles are healed.  
And then he may eat whatever he wants lightly, and does not strain to open the mouth for eating and drinking until the mandibles are well healed.  
And if the two mandibles cannot be set right at once and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden habitual conditions may arise, and possibly diarrhea, and possibly vomiting of pure bile.  
And when you see this, then know that it is a sign of death; and often those who experience it die within eight days.
