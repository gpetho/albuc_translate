O you, very dear sons, I have completed this book, which is the last of the medical science, together with its fulfillment, and have made the end by its expositions and by its declarations. And it has come to me in a vision that I should complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is strong in our region and is strange throughout, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and will come together the forms of cautery irons and the other instruments of the work with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And he who undertakes it must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the structure of the limbs, and their forms, and their junctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and position of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hands.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things previously stated should be careful not to fall into error and kill men;
so that I have often seen many of those who intervene in this science abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who cut an abscess of scrofulas or the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; so that so much blood gushed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another man who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the condition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it was cut, he would die.
And I saw another man who took on the care of the Duke of our land, who had a broken leg, and with the breaking had a wound;
and the ignorant healer bound the break over the wound with strong ligatures, and did not give the wound any care, and left it thus for a time;
and he commanded him not to untie it at all;
and remained thus until the leg was completely swollen and the foot, and came to destruction.
I was called to come to him, and hurried to come and untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, and I could not cure it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the limb was entirely lost.
And I saw another ulcer that burst the festering abscess, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is full of melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to touch it with iron unless it is in a place where all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, my dear son, you must know that the work of the hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many dispositions;
and I will show in each place in this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, you must take care of yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
Take your tools cautiously, and approach your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you come to their salvation and are praised.
and leave terrible illnesses to the serious healers;
and remove your tools from those that cause you fear, and have faith in yourselves so that you may go from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake the treatment of a serious illness unless you are called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is of cauteries of fire and of cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the tools for cauterizing, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is arranged and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and of similar things;
and is arranged from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary for me to say the quality of the aid and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of the aid, and of the harm, are the longest speech and subtle science and the secret answer;
and of this many wise men spoke, and agreed upon this;
and their words are sufficient for me, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery aids universally all complexions where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great aid; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not useful for illnesses that come from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be used to cure a hot illness with heat, nor with dryness;
and the one who said the opposite said that cautery is a great help for hot and dry illnesses that come upon people's bodies. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it to be true on several occasions through experience.
And certainly, let no one intervene except those who have tested it, and who know through long usage the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of people's temperaments, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the nature of the time;
Of other temperaments, we do not fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed upon cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not affect anything beyond the limb that is diseased, and does little harm to other members.
Burning medicines travel from one limb to another, and cause serious illnesses in the limbs. and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its high quality and good substance, does not cause harm if there is no excess.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
And for this I excuse the length of the speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret that is found in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, for the arising harm is subdued with the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pains, urgent and fast, than they cannot wait for the time when greater harm comes to the limb.
And do not think about it, dear son, as fools do. for the illness healed by cautery has no return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion and dries the humours that are the cause of the pain, and it is more valuable than medicine because of its speed, and for the virtue of its work and its authority.
And a powerful thing is that the illness comes sometimes according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the illness and its virtue;
and are assembled in him the superfluities through the acquisition of food and similar things, if it is not cauteries administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, like cauteries of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is worth anything after medicine, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last of medicine because when we administer methods of cures in any illness, and they are not effective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore it is clear that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than one of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high nature of its substance;
and they said that the place of cautery does not cause corruption, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And nevertheless, when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so do they to the fire; and thus there is enough impediment.
Or I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way might be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are done because of a disease called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and because of many dreams and toothaches and sore throats, and especially for all diseases that come from cold, like paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient be purged by a dissolving medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and constitution of the patient. and then heal the head of the sick person.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes. And let your middle fingers rest there, so it bleeds, then heat the cautery, which is called "olivare", of which this is the form: And place it on the ink-stained spot, and move your hand slowly downward and squeezing slightly in a circular motion. Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot if you see the bone slightly exposed. And if you do not see it, then reapply the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you.
Afterwards, take a little salt, and put it in warm water and moisten some cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Afterwards, put moistened cotton in butter. and leave it on until the burning is gone. Then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it cleanses itself. And therefore, it is helpful.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, then remove what is burned from the bone and treat it.
And others say one should leave the cautery on so long and apply it so forcefully that it gouges out a section of bone as wide as the lead weights women put in their spindles, so that the humours may issue forth.
And one should leave the wound open for a long time; After that, one should treat and close it.
And these two methods of cauteries do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some men where fear is an issue;
and I believe I should leave it.
for the joint is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we testify in other limbs;
and even when the patient's joint is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and with this I use work in both cases together for health.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie", and head cleansings, and oils and plasters; and if one performs the cautery that we have previously described, and it is not effective. Be warned if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; Then cauterize below that cautery a little that we have mentioned above. Afterwards, apply cautery to each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and apply cautery to the place called "vasselz"; and it is the place where one applies cupping glasses; and ease your hand so that you do not see all the way to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
and the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of cauterization of the head When sudden pain arises in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been cleansed with purifying medicines, and the other cures I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been applied, and yet none of it works: then perform cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery with sharp medicine is to take a piece of garlic, remove the skin, and cut it into two or three pieces, and then cut the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the garlic slice under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic slice, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
After, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a closed cup or a small curve, and in the middle there is a small appearance;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and gently turn the iron a little, until half of the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and a great deal of blood flows out.
Afterwards, put cotton in warm water and apply it to the area for three days; then put moistened cotton in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," use the entire point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have previously described in the divisions of diseases, and it does not work, and you see that the previously described cauteries of medicine and iron do not help, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus apply it to the aching area in a line half a finger in length, and remove your hand once, and make sure that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and be wary of the jaw that moves when one chews, and that the nerve has only regard for the movement and that spasm does not come to the patient, and be wary of a flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially for one who does not understand it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not enough for the sickness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and cure the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have discussed in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears due to cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has used dissolving medicines and other remedies as we have said in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery that is called "poins," of which this is the form:
Then prick all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place to be treated; and make ten pricks around each ear;
after treat the place until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be cured by cautery is no different from those caused by phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to those appearances that come from dryness and spasms of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm from dropsy and purgings of the head and gargling, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another slightly outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make the cautery at the head of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a finger; and leave the cautery on until half of the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the scalpel we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be slightly thicker;
after treating the place as I said before, until it is healthy.
When the apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does no good, and the patient has no fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two temples, one in the middle of the head, and one at the place called "the vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, the patient should be given large herbs and pills that purify the brain;
Afterwards, completely clean the patient's head, and apply the mustard plaster, as described in the treatise on plasters, to the back of the head;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, good. And if it is not, apply three cauteries from the middle of the head downwards to the neck, and have a space of one finger's breadth between each cautery.
And treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, apply one cautery in the middle. And if necessary, two more on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed.
And let the cauteries be called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before.
After this, treat the patient's head, then cauterize it in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; And leave them until the most of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; After treat it until it is healed, and let the cauteries called "olivare" be as we have said before.
of the epilepsy
The epileptic should not use strong fire cautery except for those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to clear the brain with years and other treatments that we have described in the division when the patient is great and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, then make gargling and chewing, clearing the brain often with good foods;
After the physician examines the head, he applies cauteries according to what we have said before, and cauteries on the vessel, and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and suffering, he applies cauteries as I said for paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and the cauteries should be olive-oil based according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, he applies small cauteries according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with those cauteries as we described for someone with paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain is cleansed, according to what is before in the division.
Afterwards, treat the head of the patient. Afterwards, make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head.
and the patient sits crossed-legged, and be well held from all sides;
Afterwards, apply the liniment, and it is worth a mixture of old bear's fat. and heat it with gentle fire, so that the patient can tolerate it when put on. Afterwards, empty the circle within the head, and let it cool.
and do this to the patient each week once with other good treatment, until he is healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several punctures with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally.
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and goose fat.
of the eye's water When water comes first to the eyes, according to the signs I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that purifies the head, and keep it from all moisture, and have him sweat in a bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, command him to raise his head, and have him cauterized in the middle of his head, and have him cauterized twice on the two temples if the water flow is to both eyes together, or on one if the flow is to one.
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the breadth of the temple;
and beware of the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution of how you will stop it;
And sometimes cautery or heated iron is used under the two bones behind.
and if it is seen that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I have described at the beginning of the affliction descending to the eyes: One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or heated irons under the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize it wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and it does not benefit him, then give the sick person three nights of gruel to drink; After that, bind his head, and apply cautery to the middle of the cautery olive; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery so that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you want, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave your hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner I have said.
from hairs that prick the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyebrows turn inwards and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two manners: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your safety; afterward, place a figure on the skin of the eyes that is as the leaf of myrtle, and let the start of the sign be next to the hairs;
then place moistened cotton in egg white and parsley mucus on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
Afterward cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, until the heart is burned there;
and the signs of the healing of the work are that you see the skin withdrawn, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then place moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed; afterward treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterward the hairs grow, and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, just as you did first;
and if the hairs are gone, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cauteries of burning medicine are that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow large and even, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take French soap and live charcoal, of each one ounce, and grind together well; and make it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the shape you have made, like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin around the eyes; and if the patient has pain in only one eye, then one should work on one, and if in both, also. and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in a good position, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it feels like burning like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, raise the area with water, and observe if you see the paper raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, then again put medicine on the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then put moistened cotton in butter until the burned heart is healed, then treat the area with the ointment called "diafenis" and others, until it is healthy.
And if you need to, take great care in your work so that no medicine gets into your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hair pricks the eye, then reapply medicine to the area softened by the paper properly, as you did before; treat it until it is healed;
and that is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to this, should be your constraints;
and may not be rejected the right path to the one who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are of no profit, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the patient to place their head in your lap; and let the assistants hold their head between your hands in such a manner that it does not move, nor does their head depart;
then place wet cotton in a bind of egg or in juice of parsley over the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a vault’s feather, together with which it should be the cautery;
if you wish, it should be pointed from one head to the other, and if you wish, it should also be like a tent;
however, this one that is shaped is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it and pull out the swelling;
Then place the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand on the cautery to the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery down to the bone, it would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and another if you need it, and leave it for 3 days;
Afterwards, apply softened cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and treat it according to what it would come to in its chapter.
And there is a method of cautery for fistulas that some of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and open the place; Afterwards, place in the fissure a fine cauterizing material of which this is the form: and there is made the quantity of a leaden .З. and hold your hand or cautery firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into their eye;
and it is necessary that one place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead will cauterize the fistula's location, and it heals with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery we have described, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nose, and to restore the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is fitting in its proper place.
Cracks in the lips Very often, cracks in the lips, which are called "poil," occur, especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly on those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, treat the area with a salve until it is healed.
When an abscess forms at the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it causes decay and rot and becomes aged and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good: Then you must apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after you cut or pierce the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and at the furthest point;
and do this once or twice, after the treatment that we have described in the treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, you must uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and that is not effective, then place the patient's head on your chest; afterward, heat the cautery, whose form will be shown later, in such a manner that you place a rod over the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery on it, and hold it in your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterward, lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterward, the patient should fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then rinse out thoroughly.
And in this way the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the softened gum is restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, where there is cold or true cold, and the treatments of medicine are of no use, then there is need for cautery in two ways: and cautery of butter and cautery of fire.
Cautery of butter is such that you take cow's butter, and place it on the end of an iron or brass spoon; after that, take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and dip it in boiling butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it has cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, dip wool and cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take a piece of iron or brass, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
After heating the cautery, which shape will come after, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery has cooled;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then quickly remove it.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whatever head you wish, and according to what you are able.
And this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moistures, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery, as the shape of which comes after, and have two openings for the fumes to escape to the cautery from the other part;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or as is necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and place on moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when it comes from a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the patient be first emptied by means of dissolving medicines;
Afterwards, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go all the way down to the throat, and don't burn the heart by more than a little.
Afterwards, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile," of which we have the form before.
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is old, then apply two cauteries on the ribs in empty spaces. and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries be what are called "clavile," according to the form previously mentioned.
And if you wish, apply a cautery by piercing the entire cautery called "poins," of which the form is shown previously in the illness of the ears;
and let the piercings be up to thirty, or even more.
After the treatment, the location as previously described, and let the cauteries be three-fold according to this form:
And because of this, the cauteries are easier, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; afterwards, lift the heart that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the armpit until it pierces the side, and the shape of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shape of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent, and this is the form of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so there are eight cauteries.
After that, place the cautery on the bruised area with a bandage; after that, rest the patient, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then make a cautery on the thick part of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries in stabbing.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach there come colds and much moisture, such that they pull it from its complexion, and the catarrh is multiplied in him, and in the usual methods of treatment, and it is of no use, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and extend his legs and hands. From that, afterwards, make three cauteries: one beneath the breastbone, the depth of a finger, to the entire clavicle cautery, and two cauteries outside the two ribs, so that the figure of the cauteries is in three angles, and there is such space between each that they do not join together when they cast off corruption;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form, without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form;
and whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and making a mark on the stomach there, a point according to the quantity that you wish to make; then cauterize it with the entire cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver comes pain from cold and moisture and large windiness, until it is forcefully removed from its natural complexion by the superfluities; and the patient is cured of what we have said in divisions, and if it does not help him, the patient must be placed on his back; and sign with three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, to rid the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and have a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and the cauteries should be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much on the entire cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a scalpel, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the entire heart, for you would dry out the entire body; and that it does not reach the boil, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and you know it for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the covering: If it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strong;
and if it is in the covering, he feels terrible pain.
And then, when this treatment should bring the pus, the patient must be propped up on his head;
and then drain the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray, whose shape is this: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and comes to the surface, so that the opening is completely clear;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of sores, until they are healed;
and it is by no means appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have long studied the art of medicine, and whose hands have frequently treated these ailments.
Then he may work boldly, and yet I think it is better to leave it alone.
about cautery with a cautery iron
The ancients said that cauteries with aristolochia roots should be done with a cautery iron, and in this way: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and also as thick and as long as your fingers. and soak it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with the cautery iron between the jawbone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down on the part under the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward. and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one other on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancient ones said that some men use a cautery iron like a razor, and heat it up and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; and the pain immediately subsides, as we have said about the abscess of the liver.
But in this procedure, there is fear, as the patient may die now, or a fistula develops that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the mouse disease according to what we have discussed in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cauteries that are all good.
Of which one way is that you make three, or four, cauteries along the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the liver cautery we spoke of before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often be on their back;
and another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart that is near the mouse, or the patient's ribs come towards the left, and let the elevation where you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the breadth of the body.
Afterwards, put the two inflamed nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery at three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures previously mentioned.
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment does no good, then you must apply four cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the depth of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to allow for the discharge of pus for a long time, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing would be hastened, and both intentions would be joined together with the help of God.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the shape we have previously shown. And the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what was described earlier.
When the feet are swollen in someone with dropsy, and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the auricular and annular bones. and lift your hand with the cautery without turning it.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water be forced out, and let the cauteries be according to this form:
Then make two cauteries on each leg, at the tip of the calf. and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without dressing, so that the water comes out;
after the treatment of the other cures that we have said.
When the loosening of the belly comes from cold and moisture, so that the virtues of retention and digestion that are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by any means of treatment; and you see the sick person suffering greatly and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach, according to what has been spoken about previously, or the circular cautery of the stomach; and four small cauteries around the abdomen, one small cauterizing cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the groin, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, the one that is entirely outside the navel, little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery below the abdomen, two inches.
And if you think his stomach is chilled, and the food does not cook, and you see the face swelling, then put one large cautery on the stomach, as it has been said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, a cautery on all the ribs. And leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, leave the area until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it, all ablaze, onto the cut althelul. and hold it there with your hand until the cautery reaches the source of the vein, where the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said. After which, apply healing ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over the wound, it will provide greater aid.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, as we will describe in its place, a sickness arises that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula appears on someone, and is old and discharges rottenness and corrupt moisture, you should apply a very thin covering over it, and take note how deep the covering reaches.
Afterward, heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula to the same depth as the covering had entered.  Continue the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the amount needed.
And be careful not to burn the nearby nerves and large veins.
If the fistula extends to the bladder or the intestine, be careful around those areas and only apply the burn to the fleshy parts, and make sure that it doesn't go too deep.
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed. If the area is sealed and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is infected and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, as one of those that we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great windiness, and does not take the form of a woman, then you must cauterize the kidneys on either side with the clavicle cautery that we have previously described.
And if we cauterize it in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and this will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and cold and moist, so that the patient retains urine, then apply a cautery to the outside of the bladder, where the hair of the knife begins, one on the right and one on the left, and each cautery should be as long as the nail of a thumb.
and apply one cautery to the back outside, or two if necessary.
And let the cauteries be shaped according to the form previously mentioned.
When the spleen is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, there is great pain. Then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the abdomen, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be small, as we have said.
When the viscous humours descend into the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And when the place of the separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cauteries be like those used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain of the hip When pain comes to the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not working, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is in two ways: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is in many ways, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make it deep and wide, and have a space of a finger's width between each cautery, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is done in the middle on the head of the hip, so there are four of them according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the center are burned.
And this is the method used for sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it goes down to the thigh and leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four inches, a little to the left side;
and let the cauteries be cut-like, and let the thick parts of the center be burned;
and if the patient feels the pain extend down to an inch or near the heel, cauterize there where he feels the pain, three or four points, with the cautery called "points". And if necessary, then make more.
And if you know the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cut-like or circular cautery, and be very careful in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have applied cautery to the ankle of the foot, and left it so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a purging of the bowels, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cautery on one and the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, regarding the cautery of the hip, this is the manner: make a tool like this, and let it be as thick as a fingertip, or a little less, and have divisions, and let it be from one division to the other, the space of a finger's width.
and let the divisions be facing in two directions, and be like notches, and there be a handle of iron well made;
and this is the shape:
And it should be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed on the sore hip, and turned to the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, the cautery heals, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the ointment treatment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless this is a good cautery, which can endure it, and the place where it is applied.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make a tool with crossbars, in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with one long side, and have two grooves, and have between each the thickness of a finger; and they should be open at the front and above, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the hot box on the patient's side lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly on the patient's hip; then pour between the two circles of hot water that has been heated over the fire a little bit, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and the burning.
For it finds there a burning sensation as if from fire;
and when the burning is gone, remove your hand with the instrument and lift the hip with soft water, and leave it like this for three days, and apply butter until what is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days to allow the corruption to come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment of ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or to the leg, make one instrument to apply water according to what you did for the hip similarly;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter;
where there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter; and place over that pot another pot well sealed, and put on alkali and lime and sweet water on top, until there is a thumb's breadth of it above the powders once you have held it firmly in your hand;
and leave it thus until the water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in many medical works and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does the work of fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes well the hip, such as turpentine and honey of acacia and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen recounts a cure with which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and greatly praises it, saying that no other cure was made, and that he was healed in a single time when this cure was performed, and he had bathed as he teaches hereafter.
And says in this way that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it finely with a bit of grease, and apply it to the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bind it on.
and leave it on for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly moistened, and put him into bed, and the pain will depart entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such remedies unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps a lot;
and the cauteries must be made in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other, which is called the foscile.
After that, take dry goat's dung, and burn it in fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease to do so until you think by your senses that it has reached the hip, and that the pain has stopped;
and this method of cautery is called "cautery of goats".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling or striking or from too great an evacuation, or from the spreading of cold matter, none of these appearances is worth cauteries, except that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been rid of foul pills or other similar things, that three lines of incisions be made on his back, where the pain is, and on each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and quantity that the patient can endure;
and the cauteries should be done according to the cautery called "pricks";
and if you wish, make 3 or 4 cauteries at the middle nail-cautery, according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to young children, and the sign of its beginning is that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find it in the last spine of the back, and in those which appear on the other spines.
When you see this and want to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery grasps each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that pricks two or three lines, and let the pricks be close together.
After curing the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery in a swelling that is in a nerve's pathway.
Of the pain in the joints
When pains in the joints are from moisture spread throughout each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra", and when it is from a cold cause and cures from medicines cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you prick on the sole of the foot, then make a cautery all over the cautery that is called "point. And if the pains extend to the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, then make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each part, all in the olive-shaped cautery form;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand too long, so that only the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, then administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, then make pricks around the fossa, two lines;
and if there remains any pain in the fingers, then make pricks on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains reach the elbows or shoulders, cauterize each part, and provide good care to the patient and give them medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge the phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the swelling descends to the testicles and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, he should not eat anything that day. and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the stool descends from his belly;
after that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the swelling subsides, and bring the swelling to your fingers, and make a sign underneath the rupture, over the bone of the groin, and make a whole sign that is like half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery with this shape:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the assistant hold his hand over them so they do not return back;
and properly open the patient's thighs, and place a cushion beneath him and an attendant upon the thighs, and another upon the chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery upon the mark with your whole hand, hold it straight, and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, begin again another time until you reach the bone; and carefully guard that the bowel does not burst when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries of children be subtle according to their size, and of large people also large according to their size;
after three days treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is removed;
after which apply other ointments until it is healed, and the patient should lie on their back for 40 days so that the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his belly does not swell when he gets up to go to the chambers.
And after 40 days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and keep it on for 40 more days;
and have good rest, let him do little work and guard against excessive drinking and eating, and loud shouting;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will say next the treatment for cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are no longer growing, apply a cautery cauterization according to its quantity, and let a third of the core be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a cautery in three angles according to this form:
but first mark the place of the incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and put your hand in the middle, covering the entire cautery with your hand.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, whether from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not helpful, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and the cauteries should be according to the length of the limb, and its smallness, weakness, virtue, location of twisting, and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must change to the limb that is next to it, therefore you must make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
The mixtures are sometimes aided by cautery, greatly aiding those illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, watch if the illness is in its beginning stages, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or stay, and you doubt that the corruption may seize the whole patient, then give five cauteries to the head: One in the middle of the head, and the other toward the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors may escape;
and cauterize the mice according to what is in front of it.
And if the mildew is scattered everywhere; and if it loses its clarity, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries we have described, one cautery on the nose, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the buttocks, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the fist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more aid you give him, and the more benefit;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain at the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the types of irons.
After the treatment, apply the place with flour of figs with honey and other remedies until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cauteries be a little into the depth of the core; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauterization is done to the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that paralyzes the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and however, no one should intervene if they are not knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" is advanced, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, of each a part; and let it be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be left to air in the place until it is healed.
the cure of a chancre by cautery
When a chancre comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that seems like a circle, all around the chancre.
And yet wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the chancre;
And yet this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen several times;
And a more correct thing is that it should be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circular", as we have said in the matter of cauteries.
When someone has a sickness called "adubelati", and it delays in healing, either due to the superfluity it causes or because of the patient's age when they are decrepit (that is, too old) and they have little blood, or because of the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the entire cautery, heat the cautery with which this form is:
And place your hand in the midst of that ailment called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from outside in such a manner that the course of the decay is alleviated.
Afterwards, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
Another type of ailment exists, called "corrodens," which is nothing other than a consumption of a limb, for it eats away at the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this ailment in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the ailment is.
After cauterizing all around until you have eradicated all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas a poultice with oil until the heat from the fire is gone, and all the corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
And if not, then recommence the cautery on whatever parts remain corrupted.
And this sore has sometimes been treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless, fire cautery is of greater aid, and I have already stated the treatment of sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of boils that come to the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, due to external causes, a disease called "clos" arises, according to our understanding, and is a large, enclosed thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two manners. That is to say, cautery of fire, and cautery of hot water.
Cautery of fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just as a piece of iron, and it should be made of good iron to the size that it can wrap around the nail on all sides, and that it have fine edges;
After that, put it hot on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make him a poultice of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall out and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment containing healing herbs until it is healed.
And if they are converted by outward fires, and it often happens in hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water there; and is in such a manner: take a copper or iron rod, or a blade of steel, and place it over the nail and the ingrowing nail, that is to say for corns; and place the rod so that it covers it all around, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand in turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path down to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will detach itself completely from all its roots.
Do this one after another until you have removed all those that are on the body, then cure them with ointments that produce flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries, or four, on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health of the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes, foul-smelling pustules appear on the body, which come from corrupted matter.
If they appear, then one should make a cautery on each head of the pustule. A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in the fire, or of long aristolochia root, or a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes, they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they came are broken, and they are healed.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great flows of blood occur from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from the outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things. And it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And nevertheless, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it firmly until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and no more drops issue.
Then place the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large ones, into the fire until they are all red-hot.
Then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it leaps out forcefully when you remove your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood gushes from the artery, it cannot be well stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said. or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong tying of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and be bound and held tight.
Whoever applies a stoppage by tightly binding with cloths or putting burning things on, or other similar things, will not be of much profit.
And if this happens to someone and they have no styptic or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein, as we have said, and extend it well until it is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it often with cold water that is very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and do inquiries beforehand about what cauteries and medicines are needed.
In the first chapter, we have told you all the diseases in which fire cautery, or burning medicines, are necessary, and the reasons and causes, and the instruments and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed through this chapter in the same way so that one can more easily find what one wants.
And before I begin this, my dear son, you must understand that this chapter has more peril and fear than the first on cauteries, and therefore greater caution is required.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come to be cured. so come those who become so angry with their illness that they die easily due to the frenzy they find in their sickness, and from the severity of its malice; and of these one should have fear.
And of these there are some who give you their insight, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the sickness is despicable.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you with this manner, but place greater consideration on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely regarding those of whom you are certain, and from whom you can obtain praise.
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients, so that health may be restored;
and this will help you acquire good reputation, glory, and lasting remembrance.
My dearest son, may our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and may you be inspired by the holy inspiration of his hand, Amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter in divisions, in accordance with what precedes, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may find more easily what you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the attendant presses too hard on the child's head;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness outside of children, and in all those I have seen, death was quick. And therefore, it seems to me that it is better to abandon this type of treatment.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and whose head grew bigger each day until it could no longer support it.
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture gathered beneath the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide incision in the head;
and it should be as long as two fingers, until the moisture drains.
and see here the form of the spatula.
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess larger, then make two incisions in the form of a cross, according to this shape:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs are that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the pus bursts out when you press it with your hand inside, and this has not been resolved: then it is necessary to split the head into three incisions according to this manner:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outward. Afterwards, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil on them, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another manner of incision is that you look at the extent of the abscess, and the collection of the water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut where the abscess is open, and the filling of water, and cut it according to what you are able to;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When it happens to someone a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is longstanding, and the cure of medicine is of no benefit, then the final cure is cauterization, with which one would cauterize the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you wish to cauterize them, that the patient tilt their head back; afterward, he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein flows, and the locations of both are near the ears, and the places are made ready;
then mark the spots, then cut both with a sharp knife from two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be at the width of the head.
And if you want, place the knife under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts continuously outward.
And if the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark and cut down to the bone;
and what is necessary to evacuate of blood is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains on the bone any sign of suppuration, cut it so that no hot abscesses arise, then bind and bandage the wound, and apply an ointment cure until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and chronic madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of it benefits him, then we will draw blood from the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of drawing from them is that the patient pull back the hair of their temples and look for the artery that is visible in the temple, for it shows itself by its beating, and is hardly visible, except in some very cold men;
and if it is visible, the patient tightens their neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and warms the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the lancet, of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues underneath on each side;
and if the artery is slender, you turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it in that part according to the amount of the two ends. For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely stop.
And draw blood from VI to III;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no decay comes before the wound heals, and blood does not flow out;
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that same hour, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the knife cautery to the bone until the ends are cut;
and this is a difficult task, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauterization is a help to finish the moisture: for this reason it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place on well-made tents;
and when one loosens them, they should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if without cutting the artery while you work on it, you hurry to cut it with cautery, or you fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have this present, place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and wash the place with cold water until the blood stops, and it is constrained as it should be;
And there should be one finger's breadth of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends, because it is not completely soldered by this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the method that is gentler and lighter in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the cutting edges should be wide to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are flowing down the veins on the head's surface, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the patient's face turn red, and feel a trembling sensation on the forehead; and if the skin is thin and moist, so that the hairs of the eyelashes have fallen out, and the eyelids are inflamed and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contusive treatment," and it is that you make the patient's hair on the forehead recede, and then make three equal cuts on the forehead along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusive treatment," and it is that you make the patient's hair on the forehead recede, and then make three equal cuts on the forehead along the length of the forehead; and one of the cuts should be just below the middle of the forehead down to the nose, and the other two are along either side of the eyelids, and be careful not to cut the arteries along either side of the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jaws, and each wound should be the width of three fingers across the joint;
and have a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths ready to wipe the blood, then apply the pointed spatula from two directions, like this is the shape:
from the incision by the temple down to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh between the two cuts to all the surface that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then put in the first cut the instrument called "cultellaire", and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is soft, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And put the cutting side of the knife towards the flesh, close to the heart, and the soft side towards the bone, and put it in until it reaches the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to where it emerges from the heart, and then do the same in the middle cut up to the other end;
and then remove blood equally, and press the place to collect the taken blood;
then place a tent of old cotton in each cut, and put over it cloths soaked in wine, oil and vinegar, and guard against the formation of hot abscesses;
and on the third day, untie the bandage, and apply a large quantity of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used for wound healing, until it is healed.
When some are afflicted with an acute cold, and you see the eyes sunken and small, and vision weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and there is sharp pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that the matter and this cold come from various veins, and the best treatment for it is this.
And you tell the patient to lie on their back, then make a large incision across the forehead, and another a wide one in the middle of the forehead. And begin from the incision on the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when chewing;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, then separate the two edges of the incision and place old cotton and linen strips there; then tie over them cloths moistened in wine and oil, and guard against a hot abscess;
When it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with things that dry out and cause flesh to grow.
In such a way: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow throughout.
of the stuffing of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or a beast, or a stone from a mine, or a similar thing like iron; or seed, such as flax, beans, peas; or something flowing, such as water and blood and similar things.
When a stone or another kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then drop a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with a condiment, and stuff his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often it comes out with this treatment;
and if it does not come out, administer extraction with subtle pincers, of which here is the form:
If it leaps out with the pincers, that is good;
If not, administer extraction with a subtle, small double-edged hook;
and if it does not jump out with that, make a copper chain and put the head of the chain into the hole of the ear firmly, and seal what is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for often it comes out like we have said;
and if it does not come out in such a manner, take glue with which birds are caught, and place any instrument fitting for this on top, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not jump out with all these things that we have said, hurry to pierce the ear before a hot abscess and spasm come to it;
and the manner of piercing is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of its virtue, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fat or dependent area; and let the incision be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and the treatment until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist due to moisture in the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with subtle tweezers and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is made easier.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should use initial sneezing remedies, and the ear should be filled with old cotton. And lie on the same ear where the water is. If it dries up because of this, it is good.
If not, take several stones according to the length of your finger, small and light, and warm them slightly in the fire; and let the patient place one or several in the opening of their ear, and jump on it from the other side of their feet, and press another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease to do this with stone on stone until the water comes out completely, and thus it will dry up completely;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end apply to fire until the most pliable part of the reed is burned;
then do the same with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said of the stone.
In extracting a creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is of no use, you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, extract them with delicate tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the instrument of which this is the form:
And it should be narrow underneath and wide above. And insert the finest end into the ear according to the patient's suffering, then suck firmly on the entire instrument; do this often until all the worms exit.
And if they do not obey to exit, stuff around the instrument with cotton, as I have said in the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have proven in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distil your oils and medicines into the ear with this entire instrument, of which this is the form as you see: And it is of silver or copper, narrow underneath with small holes, and wider above for distilling;
and to press the distillation into an instrument of well-made copper for this, and if you wish take a scraper and wrap around the tip with cotton; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you wish of your medicines into the channel, and the channel be in the ear;
then place the scraper inside the entire cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the end of the ear; and the patient smells it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated by fire before distilling it into the ear; and watch that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the stuffiness of the ears
No child is born without any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the stuffiness of a wound, or flesh growing inside the ear, and this stuffiness sometimes goes deep into the ear, so one cannot see it;
and sometimes the pus flows out of the hole, and one sees it well.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of grievous healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees, you must put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the apparent blockage, then work on all this matter of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, perfectly smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the blockage is of flesh born in or around the ear, then hold it with delicate forceps, and cut it lightly, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a delicate, thin scraper and heat it slightly over the fire, then place it within the ear canal.
If you sense the blockage of which the patient complains of difficulty hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent within the ear, according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; Then treat it until it is healthy.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
This is the ulcer that arises in ulcers of the eyes when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lenticular cautery iron, and after the incision, cauterize again.
and many times repeat, since something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come in the eyes' papers things that seem like hail in its shape and hardness, and for this, this disease is called "grandine," and is a gathering of thick moisture in the paper above and below; the work is such:
the work is such: beware if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and this is an easy thing to know;
then cut it [the grandine] along the length, then scrape each part lightly, then take it with pincers and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the paper a bit, do not worry the patient;
and if the wound is large, assemble it with a suture and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for the ointment will quickly restore it and create flesh.
And if the granulation is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, turn the paper over, and extend the granulation with pincers, and cut it and press it on either side;
and if the paper is moved away by the incision, that does no harm;
and when the granulation is cut, raise the eye of salted water, and treat the place with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in webs of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it causes great pain to their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because their tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they often lie on their faces, and sleep on their backs, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are moist, that the swelling and appearance have covered with the exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places their head on your chest;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then place it over it; and press with your fingers on either side, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture, using a sharp spatula, a slit not wider than the incision made during bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many places exinach comes from the slit, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then, pull it out with a whole piece of cloth held between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to force into the slit, so you don't reach the whole spatula to the eye, and injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then pull it out as we have said, then soak cloths in oil and water, and place them on the spot, and bind with bandages.
And some people grind seeds and apply them to corrupt the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess forms at the site, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Of the hairs of the papillary region. When additional hairs grow on the eyelids, other than those natural to them, and they age, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases, like habitual tearing and softening of the eyelids and conjunctiva, until this is a cause of the destruction of the eyes.
and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine, according to what is before or in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and stitching, or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You should place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid towards your left hand;
if it is turned, it is good; if not, then you put a needle with thread above it; and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and draw the thread above the entire eyelid, and turn it with a razor;
then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the hairs attached, along the entire septum, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then paint a figure of a bandage on the eyelid, like the leaf of myrtle, and however it should be the size you want to elevate the eyelid, which is divided in all.
And if there is such a need that a large quantity of the eyelid is cut according to the softening of the eyelid;
then cut along the entire septum on the two lines you have drawn, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and let one of the cuts be close to the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the heart, then scrape it all off;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch of a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe the blood, and let the excess thread dry on the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do this;
and if not, then take no further care, then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitches with drying and constricting things, for the paper peels off at the healing of the wound and its coming together, but the stitches are milder (as the ancients said), and this is a safe procedure; and if there is another way:
and if there is another way: and it is that you draw the paper in a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separate points according to the shape that is here:
then cut what is above in small equal forces, according to the shape that is here:
And if you do not have the strength to hold the pliers, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread and put it in the middle of the shape; and put another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads equally between your fingers;
then lift your hand equally, and lift all the leather on which you have drawn, as we have described, then assemble the two edges of the wound by stitching, and heal it until it is healthy;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerote and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs on the paper are converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of the canes is thus according to this form: and it is that you convert the paper and the slit within according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin strips as long as the paper and the width of the spatula is; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over what protrudes of the paper of the eye, and hold the two canes of the two parts firmly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that is held will die and dry and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with some force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the paper will be removed, and the hair will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and thread a fine and soft silk thread into it; then assemble the ends and knot them subtly, and the length of the threads should be a palm long;
then neatly arrange another fine silk thread in the chase, and knot the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your lap;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a delicate and minute work, then insert the needle throughout the chase into the hair root immediately, and pierce the paper quickly until you draw it over the natural hair;
then pull out the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then remove your hand so that the hairs come out of the entire chase in the paper with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you will pull the chase underneath along all the thread that you have arranged, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it through the vision of the eye;
Then you will pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair settles in its place and the flesh grows;
And if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hairs, and let it grow with that one until it is lengthened and then remove it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this illness, called "aleacrati," or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
One natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the wounding of a cut, or a surgical incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of treatment is to split that scab, and separate its edges, and put linen strips inside, and bandage it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, such as fenugreek; and water or cooked linseed and melted diachylon ointment in any oil, and wrap a bandage in it, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you guard against it not healing according to its former shape;
and these treatments that we have mentioned are only remedies to prevent this illness from returning in its former form.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds, cuts, cautery, and similar things;
And the method of treatment is to take a needle, with double thread, and pierce the flesh, starting from the inner corner of the left eye and going all the way to the right, so that the thread comes out at two points in the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh over the needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the paper's figure returns according to what is necessary, it is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the incision, turn the paper, and make two incisions on the inside edge of the paper;
And let the tips of the two incisions be at the two corners of the incision you have made, and make angles such that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "a Greek I";
Then remove that flesh, according to the amount its edges are sharper under what covered the paper, then join the two separated parts and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with the medicines that soften, and with poultices, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from an incision, or a suture, or cautery, you must make a full incision under the hairs of the papers, and according to what has been said before; then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and skilled masters devise remedies with all their power so that they can return the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are required in various situations.
When this joining happens to human hands in such a way that the paper on top is joined to the white of the eye, and cannot move or do its natural work, then you must put the point of a razor beneath the paper and lift it upwards;
and extend it with pincers, until you cut that which is airy in the subtle spatula, which should not be too sharp or too sharp, so that the patient cannot suffer the spatula to be too sharp and injure the eye;
and your incision, with which you scrape that assembly, should be gentle, so that the paper returns to its natural form;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they use sharp salty water, and lift it with sweet water, and with a collander;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and place moistened wool over the eye, abundant with egg; and after the third day use a collander and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: It is nervous and resembles a hard surface, and another which is not nervous, but resembles frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to pierce it, one cannot.
And both likenesses begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes; and lift the paper with your hand, then grip the nail with small tweezers and extend it upward; then take a needle and put a hair of horse, or cow, or ox, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and place it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it all the way through the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it upward, and scrape with all the hair the side of the nail which is next to the pupil and the silk to the hair to the tip, then cut the remaining at the root of the tear duct with all the subtle spatulas and small forces, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that with the incision the flow of tears does not come customarily;
and sometimes the nail is extended with the forceps alone, and with thread, as we have said; then one scrapes it with all the soft spatulas of which this is the form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision put a little of bruised sil and lead-based concoction into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with whatever is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nerve-related, and you cannot pierce it with a needle, and the lancet cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured with medicines;
and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a light, sharp spatula according to this shape: And carefully slice the nail, and if you see that it is thinning and the blood is close, then distil from your mouth into the eye a concoction of lead-based medicine, red medicine, and bruised sil, and bandage the eye until the next day;
If anything is contrary to you in the eye, like a boil, then leave it and treat the boil first until it is healed, then resume the procedure as before until it is healed.
then resume the same procedure until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the eyelid tissue harms the eye with great damage, then suspend it with the forceps, and cut off a part, and not all of it, so that tears do not come.
Then distill red medicine made from lead into the eye.
In some men's eyes, flesh sometimes grows red, and covers the pupil and tightens over the eyelids, and resembles a rose-shaped, hard lump;
And the procedure is that the patient puts their head in your lap, then opens their eyes, and you pick up all that flesh with appropriate forceps, and hold it with force;
Then cut the first layer of flesh, and continue cutting with a scalpel until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye during the procedure;
And let the incision be done with the spatula as we described in the incision of the nail and with small forces to remove the scab, as the shape will demonstrate following this chapter;
And when the incision is completed and all the flesh removed, apply oil of crocus or distilled red ochre and similar corrosive medicines to the eye, and put a bandage of egg white over the eye to ensure against a hot abscess;
And if anything remains, and the blood flows and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
Then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do for any flesh that has adhered to the eye in this manner.
However, you must mitigate the treatment of each eye weak in its natural way; and from the accidental way, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand into any of these works until you see that this limb is suffering that work.
Those are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the eye's work and weaken the eye every day.
Therefore, it is necessary first to look if the eye, in which the blood is, is strong, and there is no other illness except the blood; then coil it in this manner:
instruct the patient to put their head in your bosom, then suspend those veins with a whole needle according to his wisdom, and let the needles be thin and double according to this shape:
And let there be two needles by degrees in one body according to this shape:
then coil those veins forcefully, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins move strongly from the eye;
and be careful not to pierce the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins;
and when you have done this, distill green and red gall into the eye to corrupt what remains of the gravel.
And if you cannot collect all of it at that time, make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for several days until the pain is calmed and an abscess is certainly hot, then recommence according to this manner that is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the force:
The mirror is called "arissati" fistula:
when you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not yet healed, then you must open the abscess where it should fester and extract all the moisture in it until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with all the instruments whose form is shown here;
and is called "rough head," and it should be made of iron and pointed at one end, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
if the area is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and it remains like this for forty days, and it does not regenerate and is not inflamed, and no bad accident happens, know that it is healthy;
if not, there is no other remedy than to lead the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, you take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head have three angles, and the shaft be narrowed to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because air escapes if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the area with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter goes to the nose; it is then a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor a lessening, then you should bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or a haeterel without striking to draw out the fluid, then put over the eye a compress made of asafoetida, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla, and then hold the eye shut and apply the plaster over it, bound with bandages and strips;
and the manner of the strips is that you should take strips soft enough, and double each into four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then hold it shut with a hard bandage tightly, and repeat the cupping to draw out the fluid without striking;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye held shut day and night, and if the compress softens, you must hold it shut tightly;
then remove the compress after the day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster, bandages, the compress, and cupping until it is healed.
from the tearing of the cloth or skin When disruptions come in the skin/cloth, then it appears, and comes out from the pores like a grain of resin, and is frightening to see;
Then if you see it cut, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the lower part down to the upper part, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the skin around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on the oiled wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread comes loose with the skin, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the skin on all sides with a circle of cloth until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great affliction, pierce it with a subtle needle that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and put it back in place immediately;
then treat it until it is healed.
This disease, called "alcunnati," is nothing but a swelling gathered in the eye, resembling a descending drop, and it is not actually a drop;
and the method of working is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling come up towards your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend from underneath, know that it is a drop, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make a small cut on the cornea along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then distil warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then it should be treated with further treatment until it is healed.
of the drops of the eye We have already described the characteristics of the drops in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; then work according to the health.
You should make the sick person sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument beside the crown, the thickness of a finger, in that white part of the eye near the lower tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand so that it pierces into the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the measurement of the almagda's path should be to the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness; and that is the crown of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that parchment, through the clarity of the cornea, and you can place the instrument to the place where the point is, then press it along one path after another.
if the point descends now, the patient will see before him and the instrument in his eye.
After a short rest, and if the point ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not ascend, then extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of gem-salt on the point, and lift that out of the eye. Then apply over the eye bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and abundant egg white, and bandage with the sound eye.
We, and those of our time, put on a compress with abundant egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, because there are such people with excessively hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit", of which this is the shape:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put the almagda in, as we have said;
and for the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a comfortable bed, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movements, and let him eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his disposition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see certain things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not appropriate for you to do this during the hour of treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if suppurating abscesses occur, untie the bandages before the seventh day, and use those things which relieve the abscess;
and when it has calmed down, unbind the eye and place a bandage over his face for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then gradually leave the room, and return to his normal activities;
and know that no student should intervene in this case. And a man from Iraq came to us, who told us that in his country, people made a device for collecting water, but I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the shapes of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And their heads should be of the same fineness, and the rear in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there are various added fleshy growths on the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs;
and in some there is deeply sunken flesh of a dark color, and there is soft flesh of a good color. In that soft flesh, which is not sunken, you must place the patient between your hands facing the sun;
In that soft flesh, which is not sunken, you must place the patient between your hands facing the sun; and open their nostrils, and apply the lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut off what you can hold with the sharp, thin blade of a lancet, until you know that flesh is entirely removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, then treat it carefully with all the subtle instruments, so that nothing remains; and if without overcoming it, or an abscess is present, then treat it as necessary;
and if it is a malignant abscess, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply a mild and sharp vinegar or wine. If the poultice works, and moisture comes out as far as the palate, know that it is healed;
and if the moisture does not pierce as it should, know that there is flesh growing on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
Then you should insert a rather thick linen thread, and tie it in knots, with a space of a finger or less between each knot; and have the patient pull the thread end in their nose as hard as they can, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose and into the mouth;
and many children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wishes to do it;
Then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other until the knots of the thread are close together.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted the flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment has eaten away all remaining flesh;
and then put a lead foil in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for cleaning the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to cleanse the head;
and have a handle at the head to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
from the flesh over the nose
Many times a sickness called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large often, so that it is a visible thing to look at;
and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, beware if it is hard, of a dark color, of poor smell:
if it is not touched with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be cut completely, empty the patient and cut it without fear, and cure the place with dry and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity comes to one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is then necessary, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh and full of blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on either side, you must cauterize all the parts of their core until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, tighten it, and sprinkle powdered dragon's blood and crushed frankincense over it; and place a piece of strong or other bonding plaster over the powders, and leave it until it dries on its own, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the suture is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have made you aware.
of abscesses of the lips
Hard abscesses occur in the lips of men, resembling grains of millet, and smaller and larger;
Then you must turn the lips, and cut on each side, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the space after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then lift away the pus, and treat the area with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
If so, you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run;
then put on the area ground vitriol, or other constricting and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this happens many times, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and worm-eaten, such that the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
So you must make the patient sit between your hands, and their head be in your lap, and scrape the teeth or scabs where they appear until nothing remains; and thus do the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other blemishes, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes that which is there at the first application, it is good; if not, then start again on the second and third day, until you have completely scraped;
and know that the teeth require various forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, because the scrapers used to scrape the teeth have different shapes than those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary, when treating a toothache, that you delay extracting it as long as possible, for this should not be done at all; for it is a substance very high up until there is no longer any excuse for scraping.
Therefore, when the patient is constrained to extract it, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and have a good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad extraction, for we have already wanted to do it to these lords;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth thoroughly in all places to protect the gums from all sides;
Then move it with your fingers or subtle pliers in small, careful movements, until it is well loosened, then firmly hold the pliers; and let the patient's head be between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it; and if it does not come out easily, then take any of these instruments and gently push it from each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and hold it gently with pliers so it does not break while being pulled;
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part, and cause the patient greater pain than the first due to the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not do as ignorant masters do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw and do not bring about what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause great illness through the remaining roots or by breaking the jaw, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and oil;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol;
and if that is not sufficient, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should have large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and they should be of good, strong iron, and they should be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must put softened cotton soaked in butter for one or two days, so the area softens, then insert the pliers, called "algefri," whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and they should be filed like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots will not come out with all these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and apply the instrument called "althali", which is to say a pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, it is good;
If not, use all the instruments, of which the shapes come next:
And if one uses this instrument that has two blades, of which this is the shape: and other tools that are in front, in the proportion of the teeth, and of this tool that resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong, so that they cannot break, and know that there are many instruments of teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise, skillful master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks the chariot or other bones, or if it were possible, then he seeks the instruments that are necessary, as I have told you, and assists with the gestures, of which this is the form:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so it does not escape, but he can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this entire instrument:
When the tooth appears not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in maiden women, you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be straightened or filed:
Then remove it; and if it is air with the tooth, then take this instrument, of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and is of sharp, tempered iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it appears that it can be filed, then file it with a file of this shape:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move as much as it breaks;
then, finally, smooth it with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it cuts the tongue, then it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not cut the tongue nor spoil the speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either through impact or falling, and the patient cannot press on what they eat without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and this is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it double between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you have carefully reached the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the part where you began, and gently and carefully tighten your hand until it does not move at all;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position them so that they do not hurt the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
if it stays, and will serve thus for the entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of straightening the two healthy teeth, and the two misaligned ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one resets it in its place, little by little, as we have said;
and no one should interfere who is not skilled and patient, and sometimes one makes a tooth shape from cow bone, and places it where the defect is, and tightens it as we have said, and it stays and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue by nature, so that one is born this way; or by accident from a stitched wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your grip, and lift their tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament broadly, so that the tongue is loosened from its attachment; and if there is hardness or knot, and it is from a stitched wound, then put the hook in and cut that ligament broadly;
and be careful that the slit is not too deep, for the artery that is beneath;
and when you have done this, lift the place with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and treat the patient each night, so that the place may not heal.
And if bleeding occurs, then put powdered vitriol on the place; and if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it with a lentil cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it as a different color, or black or hard, and the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it, for it is a cancer;
and if it is declining to suppuration, and there is moisture, then one should apply the lancet, and slit it with a fine spatula, and release it on one side and the other; and if the blood overwhelms your work, then place powdered vitriol on it until it is stopped, then return to your work until you have extracted all the fluid;
then clean the area with oil and vinegar, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
abscesses of the throat Sometimes boils appear in the throat, called "godath," and properly called the two almonds.  And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, be warned:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the discharge of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break open on its own;
and if it is white, pale, and the root is slender, prepare the instrument for cutting, but first observe if the abscess is warm, resting, and has subsided.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your care, and let the operator open his mouth and take the tongue between his hands, and press the tongue down from the instrument, which has this shape;
and it should be of thin silver or bronze, like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the forceps and place it in the swelling, and pull it firmly upwards as much as you can;
and pull out any matter from the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, which has this shape, that resembles a pair of shears; and nevertheless the tips are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and are made of hardened or tempered steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with pliers, which have this shape: And one side is sharp, and the other is not;
And when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with hot, sharp, and easy-to-use water, and if blood comes out, the patient should gargle with water, or boiled pomegranate rind, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding stops; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides the two almonds, so cut them likewise as the two almonds.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed within her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe due to the blocked passage, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had pushed out two ribs through the two nostrils.
I hastened then quickly, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the lancet into these abscesses, and cut a part of them out, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she began now to drink water, and then wine, and I did not cease to cut away at this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised and cauterized it within the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from these matters, and I know not what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When rheum descends to the eye, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is beneath, large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is subtle, then you must cut it.
and that which is round, gathered, and not long; and if it is bloody or of a dusky colour or black, you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the way I have described, by its colour and length, you must have the patient sit in the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention previously; then one should insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the excess beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice and the speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said regarding the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you should use a method to alleviate the fear of the cutting.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp and acute. And have the patient place their head in your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with a hot sharp iron, so that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And have a small container at the head, where medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine on the sore;
and the patient should lie on their side, so that saliva and mucus drip from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not go down into the throat, and to the wound;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it onto the sore for the amount of half an hour, until you see it is healed and the stinging of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around an instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with all the cotton on the sore, until the cotton dries on the sore;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cautery with the medicine, reapply it, and after the cautery, wipe around the sore with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until they are healed.
This treatment is more effective than the incision, than the cautery;
If it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take camomile and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and yarrow and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot, and put some water in it, and bring it to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be an instrument shaped in this way: And it should be made of silver or copper, and let one of its ends be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the ulcer through the pipe, until the ulcer is dead;
After that, repeat often, until the ulcer dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, for many things can happen; and do not do this fumigation except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a pipe and put a piece of egg white inside one end, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the egg white does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and that is a good and safe treatment altogether.
Many times a fish bone or spine, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
so you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue against the sun with the entire instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; perhaps the foreign object will be expelled by vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing come off, or push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that he knows where the thing is situated; if he pushes it down, or pulls it out with the entire instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, and then you press his tongue with the instrument I have told you about.
And if you see the leech, then pull it out with a small hook, or with delicate pliers that are suitable for this.
And if this does not work, then take a thin, braided rope, and put it into the throat of the sick person, and then put a hot iron on the braided rope's end, and do this frequently. And if the sick person sweats with water all day.
then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with his hand frequently; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot where there are burning coals, and the bottom is covered with a pierced cover, and in that hole is the head of the instrument;
then pour your fumigation into it, and the patient should put the head of the tube in their mouth, and close the mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will now fall off, and if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and dry things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out, if one can see it, is like curved pliers, in order to enter the throat. and it resembles the beak of a bird, and has the roughness of a file, so that what it takes hold of, it cannot let go;
Many types of abscesses are described, according to what is remembered from one and another in this book, and they differ in perforation and incision;
and this is in two ways, one in its own appearance, and in what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is according to the places where they are on the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and abscesses of fleshy areas differ from those that arise in joints, and each has its own treatment.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen and do not ripen according to their completion, like abscesses that are beside joints.
For when an abscess arises beside joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which causes contraction in that limb.
If the abscess is near the main limb, and you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is near the foundation, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for one near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, become elongated inside, and form a fistula; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of a ripe abscess according to its completion, and this is when the pain is appeased, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of pain and redness, and the calming and sharpening of the abscess's head, and the other signs;
and you should place the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears movable;
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints, nerves, and arteries, and in all such places equally where there is no pleura. In those that bend, according to that member.
And when an abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to let the perforation wait until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be elongated from it, and is full of much filth. and perhaps the lips and the depth of it harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary to administer small abscesses, small punctures; and in large abscesses, large punctures, and many fissures according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to cut the core, and to cut; when it has become like a flap, and is decayed, then it is necessary to do as one does to boils:
and some are split into three angles, and some are cut like myrtle leaves, like abscesses of the armpits;
and some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has gathered much pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at that time, but only a portion; then bandage the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again; do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus is out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or young children, or decrepit old men. For the spirit sometimes jumps with the expulsion of the pus, so that the patient, perhaps, dies, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, conduct this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, clean the wound and examine whether the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a deep wound, apply bandages of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, it is necessary that you place a bandage in each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut into the abscess a portion of skin, and you have trimmed it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bind it for up to three days;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your work, apply cold water and ease, and moisten a cloth, and place it over the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, apply treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned in this book, and if it is in winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, you must place over it bandages and cloths moistened in wine and hot oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, you must place over it cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, for up to three days, as we have said;
and then open the abscess, dry it and treat it as necessary, until it is healed.
And this is necessary to know universally in treating abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the head's tissues come small abscesses, and are kinds of us that are in webs, like the yolks of an egg, and many of similar types.
Some are fatty and such where there is moisture like pus;
and some are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the cutting is that you must try with every instrument that is called "entromissoire," from which the form comes after, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, you cut through it with a long incision.
And when the moisture is emptied, you must then scrape away without leaving any skin that contains that moisture, for it often returns if you leave any.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if present; Otherwise, in vinegar and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and that which remains from the night will then heal.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you are certain that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a thick pus, cut it along this length; and drain its pus, and scrape it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to drawing out the pus where it lies.
and if the artery is causing resistance, do what I have told you afterwards.
And also do the same with a stony abscess, and in cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And cutting into a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they contain little blood. And if some of these abscesses are on the head, where there is no moisture, and from these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it with anything, one would have inflicted a wound as if from a stone.
In other abscesses appearing on the head, except those on the heads of children and the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place to allow the pus to come out;
and treat them as necessary.
Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous abscess is properly within its own pocket, just like a boil and abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one, then, that you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side, and is not inflamed around the nerves of the neck or the artery or the conduit, and is not deep;
if it is necessary to cut it open, and scrape it from every part, and spread the two lips of the wound with forceps, if you need them, as we have said about abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be certain that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula be neither sharp nor cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and do not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, then put powdered vitriol, or some powders that stop blood, into the wound, and constrict the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound softens, and begins to rot.
And when the blood has stopped, return to your work until you complete it;
then search with your index finger if any small sores remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the sore, it is not right to cut that sore at its root, but tie a strong double thread to it, and let it fall off without harming it;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the entire sore, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since no excess remains because of the sore's size. if you must, cut the root, and pull out the pus, and stitch it as we have said.
if you must, cut the root, and pull out the pus, and stitch it as we have said. Those sores that have excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce them thus, as the one previously mentioned, by depending from it, then apply dressings with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the sore throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, it is necessary that the opening of the throat, called the "epiglottis," be released; and no aid be given by them, because all the veins and the flesh of the sick person are close to those with a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four circles, a small incision through the middle, between the two circles or with the depth of the slit, and not into the cartilage;
and that place is suitable for the incision of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are distant.
And if the master is afraid, he must stretch the skin of the throat with all his might, then cut the throat until he reaches the channel; and drain the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm from the channel that leaps out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed that one fears strangulation, bring together the two edges of the throat wound, and stitch it all together without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says one should not do this until the throat is completely stopped up, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breathing fails. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to stitch the wound and heal it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a lady took a knife and plunged it into her throat, and cut a portion of the throat's flesh.
and I was called to heal her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and saw clearly that she had not cut a vein or artery except the throat, and air was coming out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the lady suffered only that she was hoarse-voiced, and later returned to her normal state;
Therefore, I say that there should be no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "goiter", and is a large abscess the colour of a jaundice, and is very common in women;
and it is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no contrivance.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from us from an artery; and if there is fear, one should not operate forcefully except in the small, and should test and seek throughout the entirety of the injury: if you find it just like fat, and it does not connect to any vein, cut it, as one cuts fat, and pull it out from its entire covering, if there is any. and thoroughly investigate everything, and treat it as necessary, until it is completely healed.
Many types of fat exist, of which I will describe all the varieties;
and here it is necessary for me to say the whole difference that exists between fat and issue.
I say that issue is hot and feverish, as long as the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat cease.
Fat has neither heat, fever, nor pain, and contains its own sack, and is similar in color to the body, and begins like a rind, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the fat, to first examine it with the entire instrument called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of examining abscesses of fat is to take the moistest spot you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, and this is according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the instrument, and pay attention to what may jump out.
If moist matter runs out, whatever color it has, then you lance it as I have said about other abscesses;
and if, after the instrument, no moisture comes out, know that it is greasy, then lance it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it from each side, and watch the skin where it lies, that you pull it out healthy with the fat;
and if you cannot pull it out whole, pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the pus returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and apply soothing things to the hot abscess, and cure it with other cures until it is healed;
and if the pus is large, then suture the two edges of the wound, and cure it with what generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is against you or something else, then hurry and fill the place with pulverized vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound rots and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cauterize what has remained of the pus.
See here the forms of the intruding instruments, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares called "albaret," and one that is called "breb," and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for searching abscesses of fistulas;
and are also like the needles with which one sews garments, and are of brass, or iron, or silver, and better are those that are yellow, and are more proven of black lead for searching the corners of fistulas;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two bends of three kinds as well;
and there are probes that have three bends, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes that have two bends, and probes of one bend only, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these which are cut are sharp, and of such there are some that do not cut much more than on one side, so that one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these instruments are lancets fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them during the opening of abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one does not use them much except in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and the groin, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to the bark of hazelnuts, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and one places it sometimes at the place that bleeds from cuts in the veins, and arteries, and sometimes according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to become corrupted, so that they seem like women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them, must do so according to this shape of this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a medicine that generates flesh, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens with women, then split it into two ribs above, by two similar cuts; so that one is attached to the other at the end of one and the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer to it what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not entirely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton moistened in a corrosive ointment; and leave it until it eats away the remaining and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are a kind of hard scrofulas, where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those, therefore, that contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of a similar nature to scrofulas, cut it as we have said in the division of scrofulas, and if the wound returns pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is sealed over it, there often arises an abscess, and likewise it happens to a swollen vein and abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep. and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel the tightening.
and when it is due to the vein, the redness is apparent.
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, one should avoid iron treatment, and the one at the head should also be avoided, and in that which is swollen from an artery, one must cut through the skin from the length.
Then make the incision with a scalpel, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed.
Then place a needle underneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and bind the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
Then pierce the place between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood flows out and the abscess is relieved.
Then apply the treatment that causes the swelling to subside, until the ligature falls off. Then treat it with the appropriate ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a vein incision, you must hold as much of the abscess as possible on your hand, then insert a needle under the area you hold, pierce it, and apply a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side. Then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or the ligature on one of the two sides, using the two ends of the thread.
And if you fear the thread will loosen, re-insert another needle through the entire thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut away the excess from the core and leave what is attached.
Then place a damp cloth soaked in wine and oil, then administer treatments of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the arteries and veins, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or from too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and arms and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in various conditions without pain.
And when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but beneath the skin.
And it moves well in every direction, and neither forward nor backward, nor beneath nor above, and that which is in joints should not be cut with a knife. Perhaps contraction would result. And that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet.
And that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers and cut it at its root.
And if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, and its root is subtle, and the stem large.
And there are small and very large ones.
And I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference; they were white, had fine roots, were often split, and moisture often ran from them.
I cut them open and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other; the procedure for the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the tumor is white and moist with a subtle root; If it is cut with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence.
If it is cut with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence. For in the cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
And if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread and tie the tumor as we have said, and leave it for two days;
And then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts through the tumor, and it breaks apart without effort;
And if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting, especially for the belly, but you may well cut half of it and then cauterize it so it does not return;
Then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tumor which is of fixed color and poor sense and milky appearance.
For it is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of the chancre later.
When the abscess is mature If the appearance of the abscess comes from a wound or a cut, and is on the abdomen, and some of the abscesses arise, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries as described before, or from flatulence;
And if it is from the rupture of the skin and the discharge of the pus, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and is a slight thing without pain, and appears with diverse discharge. And if it is due to the discharge of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when pressed with the fingers it recedes, and then returns, and perhaps it is sealed, and grows greatly at the entrance to the bath and because of hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, and is fixed according to a certain quantity; And if it is due to windiness, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or vein, or windiness.
And if it is due to windiness, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or vein, or windiness. Then you should leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, due to the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestines or bowels, you should instruct the patient to hold their breath and lie stretched out straight, then apply leeches all around the wound; then have him lie often between your hands, then go around the area that you have marked with leeches, then spread half the abscess over the entire large incision; then bind it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be free from the binding;
then open the half of the abscess spread over the binding, and place your index finger into it, and seek the intestines; if you find it caught in the binding, then untie it, and push the intestine to the outside of the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it to the incision, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein hinders you, then go around carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads into them, and put the two needles around what you have made in a cross that you made pierce;
then constrict the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area with what is necessary, and close the area.
of chancre We have discussed in the division the appearances of chancre, and how one should treat it with medicine, and how one should avoid the treatment with iron;
and we say that chancre develops in the flesh, and great care is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when chancre is in a place where one can scrape it off, like chancre in the breasts, and in the thigh, and similar places, and it should be entirely removed when it is in the beginning;
No one ever healed one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile several times;
then let the patient bleed if there is a manifest fullness, then prepare the patient well for the treatment;
then remove your instruments from the ulcer, and shave the hair from all sides, and remove the bone from all sides, leaving nothing;
and let the blood flow freely, and thoroughly clean the area with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding is too much and it is contrary to the incision of the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the different types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water happens, the signs of each type, and the treatments using medicine and those using iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: namely, tympanites and hyposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicine, and the treatment does not help, check if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea, constipation, or similar things; then do not use iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see a patient with strong constitution, and they have only dropsy as an illness, and are not too young or too old, then you should act like this: lift the patient straight onto your hands, and apply pressure to the belly by pushing the water towards the lowest part of the chest, then take the thorny spatumile according to this form: And let it be sharp on both sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot wound them;
then observe if the dropsy is lodged towards the intestines: if this is so, you must cut open above the pouch three straight incisions below the blade; and if the dropsy is due to a liver ailment, let your incision be on the left side of the pouch, three inches;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right; and it is not appropriate for the patient to lie on the incision so that the superfluities do not run to that weak spot;
then pierce through all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand through all the space between the skin and the surface, just as in skinning, to the depth of a fingernail or a little more;
then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and put in this instrument of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is of bronze or light iron, and has a small hole on the underside; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is shaped like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision by which the writer shapes the feather:
at the top of the head is the groove, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it will now descend onto the instrument;
empty then half or a third of it, for if you empty more than is necessary at that hour, perhaps the patient will die because of the resolution of his spirit from the weapon, or he falls unconscious, or he approaches death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the patient's virtue and pulse signify;
then draw the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart that seals the opening on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce according to this manner;
then recommence the instrument the other day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and beware of failing until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave a lot of water there, then cure it with hot sand or burial, and by sweating a lot or bathing and sunbathing, and let him drink; and cure it with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it must be pierced, then it should be pierced very subtly in this shape.
then place a subtle lead plug in the opening, and bind it and keep it thus for three or four days.  And when he wishes to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then replace it.
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes to flow will not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small shall be treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis. and they cannot copulate because the matter cannot reach the bladder, and this is a bad illness.
And the method of treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it like the shank of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as is necessary;
and be careful of the bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the sores on the penis Many times these sores appear on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
if it is necessary to take them with a fine forceps, and cut and clean them all, then put on moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat with Diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the sore is malignant, of foul color and stinking, then you should apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the sore is under the shaft, and part of it is within the skin and part outside, then you should remove the part of the sore that is inside first; and when it is closed, then treat the part outside.
For when you treat them together, the shaft of the penis is not certain to not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and to the testicles;
So it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and figs, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cauteries help with two conditions together: that is to say, to the bleeding, and to the corruption;
And if the shaft of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you should insert a lead pipe into the penis, and the patient should urinate through it;
And when the skin is inflamed on the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it occurs due to a wound or abscess, then you must cauterize it with a heated instrument, until the connection is severed, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
And if it is a serious condition, you should cauterize a small area on the head of the penis and the skin;
Then gently separate them and place a thin linen bandage soaked in cold water on it, so it does not become inflamed again.
Circumcision is not a simple severing like other wounds; However, when we perform this operation, especially on children, it is necessary to do the best and most gentle work for their health.
I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision for their children, because they did not practice it in their laws, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen most of the masters and lords who performed circumcision using a knife, or force, or some new tool;
If the knife slipped, because there are two blades, and perhaps one above is cut and the one below remains. Then it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the healing of the knife wound is not certain on the tip of the limb;
and during the healing of the nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and the work is undone, and many times they heal without needing more healing, and I have seen this.
Of the healing done with force, and with a thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for force cuts evenly both above and below.
For when you press your hand, you cut evenly throughout all the time. but let the thread be tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first work is such that you should make the child, if he understands, think that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and you can make him happy in all the ways you can.
then hold it upright between your hands, and hold the forces between your hands or under your feet so the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the rod and blow into the core, and pull it upwards until the head of the rod is straight. then cleanse it well of the dirt that has collected there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one stitch to the other.
then cleanse it well of the dirt that has collected there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one stitch to the other. and hold it with your two fingers by the second stitch, the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two stitches, then lift the core quickly and pull the head of the rod. then allow the blood to run drop by drop, for this is the cure. and put powder over and over the powder, a thin layer of glue made from a boiled egg diluted with rosewater, mixed with good, fresh rose oil, and leave it until the next day, and cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
the two heads should be taut and sharp, and the heads should also be as large as the handle equally.
The error in the cleansing occurs when the heart is exposed within the incision.
Then you should extend it to your fingernail, lest the place become an abscess.
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your fingernail, then hold it with pliers and then cut it.
And if they pass three days, and that which is beneath the rod is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as best you can, and be careful not to harm the part of the rod, this will not hurt it at all.
Then treat the place with the things suited to wounds, as we have said in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts deeper than necessary and it goes above, it will not be harmful.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by a blockage of stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have mentioned in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention to be caused by a stone that is lodged in the neck or the bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And the feet should be placed on the back, and the patient should extend their abdomen toward the back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the shape:
And it should be of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And it should be one and a half palms long, and thin at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a stool, and anoint the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently place the syringe on the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then pull the penis up towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient feels it coming to the empty space, and this is not done in this order except because the passage it goes through is twisted;
then pull out the thread with the small piece of wool bit by bit, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood come in the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you wish to distill sharp things and medicines there, then use the instrument that is called a "clepsydra," and this is the form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they tightly seal the urethra without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture and inject when necessary;
and when you wish to inject your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the injector into the moisture, and pull while injecting;
so you will draw the moisture into the injector, and then push the injector forcefully in; so the moisture will enter, and will go to the bladder now, so that the patient will feel it;
and that is the form of the subtle clyster used to clyster the bladder:
and it is of silver or of metal, and the tip is higher;
and underneath the skin where the vein falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture in it with which you wish to clyster the bladder, then tie it between the two skins with a double linen thread, and heat the moisture a little over the fire;
then put the tip of the clyster into the tube, then squeeze your hand over the bladder until all the moisture has entered, so that the patient feels that the moisture has arrived in the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a dial, and put inside it what you wish of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, and their extraction along with the medicines;
and have described the difference between stones in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one should operate with a scalpel; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that stones lodged in the bladder happen more often to children, and this is a sign that water leaks from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety;
and it shows sand, and the patient rubs their penis, and it hangs down many times, and then hardens; and much of this leaking damages the foundations;
and the healing is easy in children up to four years old, and is very difficult in old people, and is moderate in young people, those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move them downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes out from the upper part;
then have him sit between your prepared hands, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the bladder is all sloping downwards;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut over the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching at all, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a young adult. and place it in his/her fundament, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and push it out to the place where you want to cut.
And command the attendant to press the bladder with his/her hand, and command him/her to extend the nipples upward with his/her right hand, and with his/her left hand remove the skin beneath the nipples in the area where the incision is to be made;
then insert the spatula, the shape of which is this: And cut between what is between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle but on the side of the left groin;
and be straight over the stone, and your fingers be continually on the fundament, and let the cut be through so that it is wide outward, and narrow inward, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure from your finger on the fundament will cause it to jump outward without difficulty;
and know that there are stones that have angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, similar to a ball, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it doesn't come out, you must use tongs, which are like a file at the end, to hold and pull the stone so it doesn't slip away; or you place beneath it a thin, curved instrument at the end;
and if you cannot extract it thus, enlarge the opening a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first take out the largest one, and then cut above it, and pull it out forcefully, and then the smaller ones if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be loosened, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: where he dies, or his urine comes out repeatedly through the wound because the place cannot heal;
but nonetheless, try to pull it out, or break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, apply the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood, and compress it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, thoroughly wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come in the wound and corrosions, and congealings of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained thereby, which is known in such a manner that without discharge with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will corrode the bladder and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and assist him in every way you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and assemble the remedies over the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and is stuck in, and the urine cannot exit; if you treat it as I have previously said, that you cut it many times, one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take a piece of iron according to this shape and let it have three angles placed in a triangle.
Then take a thread and tie it around the urethra below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
Then gently insert the drill into the urethra until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill in your hand against the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
Then urine will come quickly, then press your hand on what remains of the stone which is inside the urethra. Then it will be broken, and will jump out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the urethra at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman well-skilled who will expose herself to scrutiny, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art of medicine;
And the fourth way is that the stone in the woman is deeper than the stone in the man, so that a deeper incision is needed, and there is great fear. And if necessity commands this, you must take a skilled midwife, and it is hard to find one, and if you find none, search for a subtle and chaste mirror;
and present a wise and experienced woman, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to perform what you order her to do in the inquiry of the stone; and observe closely whether the woman is a virgin:
and observe closely whether the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the fundament and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she must hold it beneath her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger into the afflicted area, and seek it pressing her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down to below, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut into the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the groin, where it is apparently located, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can come out forcefully, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those with ridges.
so know their appearances to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have instruments as I have told you in the extraction of stones, to help you in your task;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages, and do not begin again this, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, lest the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the place is healed, then return to your task, until the stone is removed.
A watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus beneath the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "pus", and sometimes it is properly within the sac of the testicle, so that one might think it another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color leaning toward jaundice, or it is blood red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more.
and these are the signs for knowing this assembly, because if it is the white, as we have said, then it is a deep abscess, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is not apparent, because it is surrounded by moisture entirely.
And if there is moisture in its own fabric, then the abscess is deep with a part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you test it throughout the inner space, the form of which is mentioned before. According to this, then, which comes after the inner space, judge what is within.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be made healthy according to their power and the fullness of their body.
Then support him on his back, on a somewhat raised surface, and place many cloths under him;
Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs near the testicles;
Then take the spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise through the middle, right up to the point of the knife, and make your incision perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the testicles down to the white surface, and carefully peel it back according to your ability;
Then pierce the flat surface with water through one large opening, and draw out all the water, and then place your hooks, and stretch the surface upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the surface; cut all or in pieces very subtly, the side of it, if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, put it back in place once you have finished working on the surface;
then stitch together the two leathers of the testicles with a stitch, then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
Then cut the testicle with the entire suspensory, remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if the bone is joined in two parts together, know that these are two splinters; then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe the blood away, and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe the blood away, and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and put another layer of wool soaked in wine and oil over the two splinters, and place doubled cloths on top, and bandage it according to this method:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with shredded wool in this manner and sew them together at the crotch of the breeches, and one end goes over the bottom to the back, and the other to the area around the groin;
and the other two ends over the two armpits, and the entire fastening should be gathered at the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and you should take a sharp surgical cautery iron, and cut the skin over the splinters, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface containing the liquid is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this method, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, sharp cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you remove everything;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more healing; and carefully avoiding blood flow, and gentler than the work of cutting;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess or blood flow or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been previously said.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then perform perforation, as I have told you, and if you are certain, through the signs we've discussed, that the watery humor is superficial, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the part beneath the entire skin surface, and place the perforation lengthwise along the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the fluid drains out;
then place cotton on the area, and bind it, and allow the remaining fluid to drain, and then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the fluid to escape from the opening of the wound, then you must insert a reed or an instrument used to extract fluid from hydrops, of which the form is previously described;
and enlarge the wound a little, and know that the fluid returns, and is collected after six months or more, and when it is collected as before, then the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the treatment of this ailment there is fear in several dispositions, wherefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the treatment and the signs of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come upon the body, and especially on the testicles; and it is by many causes.
This is to say by a superfluity of sharp and acute [humor], which is spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps an abscess is grievous, fearful and painful, and of a dark color, and sometimes comes from a cut artery, or swelling of a vein.
When it is from a cut artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
One that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this type, and on other sores; And it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then lift the testicle upward, and pull the white membrane firmly, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with these related sores, then you must pull the testicle and cut it.
And if it is airy on the surface, or in that which is inside the vessels, then you must free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the sore is in the rear, then you must cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a wrapping resembling a boil, with a softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he moves.
And the treatment of this illness is as dangerous as the one before, and nevertheless we will tell you its method, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit upright, then place the suspensory for the testicles down to your fingers, covering all the vessels near the penis, and the master should grasp them and extend them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide scalpel, cut across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then cauterize each side, as we have said in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Then insert a needle where there is a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the wound appeared, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle directly, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupt moisture.
Then treat the wound as the others, where pus is generated, so that no vessels leak to nourish one of the testicles.
For by this there is no harm, and if blood comes from all the vessels, then both testicles should be removed. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this wound is due to the cut or tear in the surface, or the stretching on the belly in the area of the groin, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
And this rupture is either in the surface, or from its stretching, and these two types come from many causes:
or from a blow, or a fall, or a strain, or the lifting of a heavy load, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the surface are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are even up to almost the bottom, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the signs when it is from the section of the surface are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear various, beneath the skin, and this is due to the escape of the intestines and the body escaping from the surface.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the hernia, and are trapped within, and cause great suffering to the patient, especially when pressed.
And in these treatments of iron with fear, because it should be avoided.
And the method of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand into the wound, if it can be returned; then be placed back on his neck, between your hands, and lift the thighs;
then extend the torso upwards, and cut all the skin from the testicles lengthwise; then push inside the lips of the waist, with hooks as you need to open the wound, and be such that the pus can come out;
then scrape the surface that is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is exposed on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which surrounds the testicle, into that which is between the white surface that is under the skin of the testicle, and the second surface, and separate that which is behind the testicle, and between the second surface;
and then move the right hand inside the body of the testicles, and extend the white surface upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the waist; and instruct the attendant to extend the testicle upwards, and loosen that which is above behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of X threads, and place it in the rear part of the surface, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends that appear of the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and bind the surface, of which we have spoken, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and bind them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, so that a festering abscess does not arise; and put back the bandage according to the first bandage, long two fingers of that, and after these two bandages, leave of the surface, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, the width of one finger; and after all the other, according to the roundness that the egg bears;
then cut in the part that is beneath the skin of the testicles, as much as the blood runs, and the swelling, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and put on wounds, and administer the bandage that we have said. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, due to the fear of blood flowing. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it takes too long to fall off, it should be soaked with hot water, and put on what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is healed perfectly.
of fleshy hernia
In this treatise, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done as in the treatise which is next to the text, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting slightly above or below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel drains;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs within the ribs, as we have said, and the wound opens;
and no intestines descend into the groin; and if any descend, it is little, and repairs itself at any time;
and nonetheless if it stays too long in this place, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens through the extension of the ulcer that is on the ribs, as we have said, for it extends, then softens and swells the place, and it opens;
and the cure is through cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient often lies on their back between your hands, then cut the place of the rupture inflamed with a broad blade according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the ulcer that is under the skin that surrounds it, then take the rod and place it on the apparent place of the ulcer;
and press it deep into the belly, then cut the two apparent places of the ulcer above the head of the rod, and cut one and the other;
then extract the head of the rod, and do not cut the ulcer or extend the egg or anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of the intestines' rupture; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The ulcer is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the tissues within are softened, and it is visible.
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one have the sick person lie on their back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of the castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would not like to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one of which is that the master may be able to answer when asked, and to know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging. then take them in your hand, until they are returned and you no longer feel them.
Of castration of the tail: you must restrain the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut on each testicle in one blow, once you have properly burned them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface that is over the vessels;
and this manner of castration is gentler than that done by pulling, because in pulling, perhaps some part of the testicles remains, causing the animal to desire lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also like the form of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and has above the vulva also like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut away the joined flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is a joined flesh over the natural part, so that it is too ugly to look at; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You must cut the excess tentigene with your hand or shears, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come, then treat it with another cure until it is healed;
and there is another flesh that arises from the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps leaps out, and is like a scab, and for this the ancients called it "scab disease". If it is necessary, you must cut it, as we said the tentigene, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is by nature, or by accident through illness that has come to it;
and is by nature, or by accident through illness that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or by a thin or thick surface, and is made deep within the marrow, or in the ribs, or below, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the ability to have children;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the wound.
If the numbness is visibly near, then look at your fingers or the limb.
If it is from a thin surface, and it is near the two lips, then hurry, and do this:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin surface is healed, and the numbness is relieved;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie on her back every day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the surface is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatula resembling a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is of fresh flesh, then suspend it on a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stanch blood, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, and the white of an egg mixed together;
then apply a broad lead band so that the wound cannot heal;
and let it remain for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent;
then be treated with other remedies until he is healed.
And when in the flesh there comes a new growth, it must be cut according to this method, if it is not a festering abscess. For a festering abscess in the flesh, one should not use fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become painful.
And we have already discussed the similarities to them, and the signs, and I will now discuss those that receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and pain, when deep within the flesh and do not appear on the surface, are not cured by cautery.
Those that are at the opening of the flesh, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you should place the woman in a cool room, then grasp the pain with pincers, and cut it at its roots, then powder on medicines that constrict blood, such as oak galls and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then put her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without causing wounds;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointments until it is healed;
and the one called "albathir" is red, and is like a rough head, so it should be cut like the thelul I said; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many types of abscesses occur in the marrow, such as ulcers and stony abscesses, herpes, blisters, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary, therefore, that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes in the marrow, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment with iron, observe whether the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, full of heat and fever, and whether it turns red, if you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is relieved;
and then make the patient sit on a seat, and let him have two small seats where he can lean, and lean on his back and bring his feet to the sides of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread out, and place his arms under his knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the sore, from which the shape will come afterwards;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the sore, so that what enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not harm the patient; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the sore with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and it is opened by hand gently, then it must be cut at the head, with a sharp instrument.
And when the boil is emptied, then it is necessary that you place in the wound wet cloths in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and place the cloth deep within the wound, and place on top of the wound and on top of the lancet clean wool soaked in water or boiled mallows;
then treat it after two days of the appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the wound by means of an enema of water and honey, and then with water or roots of lilies and long-boiled aristolochia; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is festering in the wound, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is necessary first for the midwife to know the nature of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing down, and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to be born. Then know that this birth is according to natural form, and the child emerges beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child exits quickly.
For when it descends under its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing.
And that which comes out otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes out on its feet, or the body or head, or hands, or it comes out on its belly, or sometimes, and is perhaps turned around on its neck, and by other bad positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in these matters, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes out on its head through a natural passage, and the woman is giving birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, make her sit on a stool, or have women hold her up.
And apply oil or fennel seed poultice, and then let the midwife place the small spatula, whose form is like this, between her fingers: And cut the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture inside comes out.
And press the woman's abdomen until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fennel seed and dill seed oil.
Then make her drink and sneeze with the mixture, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: Then the child will come out now.
And if the two hands come out forcibly, it is necessary that you gently reposition them little by little; and if they cannot enter, place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up; then lift the seat onto the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when it is lifted;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is placed before, and extract the child, and reposition it likewise.
of the child's exit from its feet When the child comes onto its feet, it should be pushed upward; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take it by the feet and extend it little by little.
If it jumps as far as the thighs, then order it to grab, and make it sneeze by condition; if it jumps free, if God wills.
And if it is not free as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural form. For then it is light.
And if it does not come free as we have said, take chickweed, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind all together in a mortar; and put on the affected part of the woman this ointment, and then make her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened from below, make her a poultice of myrrh, and place it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a chair, then make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will now jump out.
from the delivery of the child upon her knees When the child comes into this form, let the midwife put her hands gently. then let her be supported on her neck, and her feet hang down, and let her lie on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then grasp her hands on her stomach, and remove the cushions underneath her, until she is ready to deliver; and if the child does not emerge, then grasp her feet and move them forcefully, then move her stomach upwards, then push with your hands; and draw the child out gently; and tell the woman to strain as hard as she can until the child emerges.
from the birth of the child who comes out with one hand outstretched it is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back. if one cannot bring it back, have the woman lift and walk;
if she cannot walk, have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on a seat, then study to bring the hand back; and bring the child according to its natural form, and have her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child is out.
from the child's exit on her neck, and let her hands be spread out, and her face turned towards her mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and move it gently;
and when it is equal, then put on the natural mucous substance of aloe and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, have her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire afterbirth
in this same manner for the entire afterbirth When it comes forth in this manner for the entire afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs on its face and on its neck, cut it from the body, so that it is not held back, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as is proper, and instruct the woman to take herself some rest:
of the issue of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface which divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as one whole child, as we have said.
And if they emerge with difficulty, the cure is as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what she must; and do thus as it deserves to be healed. of many children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb I or II or III or IV or V or VI or VII, or many up to fifteen, and are all formed in the form of a child by the measure of the wise glorious one, and it is necessary that the midwife know all this, for perhaps such things happen to her; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to manual work; so it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
so it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two parts, or bind her to the bed so that she is not pulled down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with the mucilage of althea and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the hands of the attendant with these oils and mucilages;
then gently insert them into the womb, then seek the place where she puts the hooks that are appropriate to it, and watch if the child is prepared to descend on its head;
if place the hooks in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the armpit or near the ribs, and if the descent is on its feet, then place it in the legs and middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently insert it with his whole hand, and fix the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another hook, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally by moving from one side to the other, to pull it out, and let the hooks be toothed to hold it, as is the form here:
And if a part remains, then anoint some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part remains, then place this hook in a higher position, and do so until it is entirely removed.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and he cannot pull it back due to the tightness, then you must wrap it with a cloth, until it is entirely removed; then cut at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus you must do in the other hand, and the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage narrow, or it has a sharp point assembled, then you must put a pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the point and remove the sharpness; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach", from which the shape comes with the instruments or chapter that follows this one;
and thus do the same if the child has a large head naturally;
and then draw the bones with pliers, and if the head slips out and it is tight with a force, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the pus is released;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the traction is gentle, and the straightening towards the mouth of the wound is gentle.
And if it is narrow in the belly or in the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and split the belly or breast, until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other members are removed, and the head remains, the healer puts his hand deep into the wound, and pulls it until the mouth of the wound; then he puts one or two hooks in, and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the wound is narrowed by a hot abscess that has come in, then one should not work on it, but one must administer moist and greasy things; and he administers plasters, and sips in soft and moist water.
And if the infant is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said about a living child;
and if one cannot, then pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said concerning hot abscesses that come in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then it should be placed in constricting water, and he should administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another placed above it, and the other was also killed. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and swelled until it opened, and began to discharge greatly.
I was called to treat it, and I pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days another. I was greatly astonished, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was in a better state; and the woman lived a long time like this, and a little bit of pus would come out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only so that when the master finds a strange thing, he may know how to assist it.
After this comes the form of the press, with which the books were made;
and with two turns on two sides of the two chains. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the tube should be one finger wide, and the margin of the wood one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two chains should be two attachments of this same tube, which should be fastened on one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two attachments are put into the mouth of the marris to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to pliers; and have two attachments at the two ends, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the marris with the whole instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, feet hanging down and legs open, then put the two joined attachments together into the marris, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the whole instrument, just as you did with the pliers, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the marris, so that the woman does what she wants.
These instruments are all equipped, and their appearances are multiplied; and when the master has them prepared, the work is all the faster and the more expensive for their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; and if she jumps because of this, so much the better.
If not, she takes a pot, and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs that can open the passage of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in the pot with water over the fire;
then place one end of the cane in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and warm it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in the juice of mallow, and then apply it to the area, and seek the afterbirth; and when she has found it, then she should take it and stretch it slowly and correctly, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it should be moved slightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled. It will come out and detach itself.
And if the opening of the womb is too tight, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not healed by all that we have said, then be careful not to overdo the pulling.
But it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a clyster of four-ingredient ointment; if it will fester and heal, and come to strength;
However, when it festers, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and hurts the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigations are needed for this:
None of the ancients have proven the fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman with the retention of flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of a similar shape to a chain, and one places the slender end in the natural opening, and the wider ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the scab until it is gone, and begin another.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but instead have it stopped by a subtle, thin membrane. If so, it is then necessary for the midwife to pierce that membrane with her finger, and not to pierce it with a pointed instrument, and to be careful of the tying so as not to touch it;
then place soaked wool in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not stop up, place a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and have it removed when the child is ready to go to the chambers.
And sometimes these stoppages come from the closing of a wound or abscess; if it is necessary to cut that blockage; if it is treated, as we have said about the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are lumps, and swellings that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, if there is one fistula or several;
and when that lump is old, it opens, and often discharges white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and are known by this, that there comes out either excrement or flatulence when the sick person expels excrement, and perhaps a worm leaps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce all the way to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and reach down to the hip joint, and to the root of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes the perforating fistula at the fundament, and not the non-perforating one: and it is that you put your index finger into the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is a twisting, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening with expulsion, wind, or pus, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; therefore hurry to treat it.
And when the fistula pierces down to the bladder or to the urine duct, urine leaks out, and cannot be closed by medicine.
If it has pierced down to the hip joint, the tent extends to the spot; if there is no twisting and the pain is localized around it, then a boil will often appear there, and no medicine or ointment will help;
and in these piercing fistulas there is no cure except for labor, and the foolishness of the false healers who meddle with them.
In one that is not piercing and not old, there is hope for health by means of iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back;
and the patient raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined to his belly; then put a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the foundation, then you should put your index finger there, and then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and be uncovered where you feel between your finger the surface or the flesh, then know that it is piercing; if not, do not work on it as it cannot be healed.
However, it is said that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the aid that is given is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it comes near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that these false tissues are burned, which are like a bird's feather;
and then treat with tents soaked in butter, until that tissue comes out, then treat with ointment, causing new tissue to grow and close.
If it is thus healed, it is well.
If this, otherwise cannot be healed;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is at the foundation, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or pus, and you see the fistula at that which followed the covering of the heart; if you cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterward, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those misplaced flesh that appear like a bird's feather, and leave nothing behind.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For cauteries of fire bring together two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and drying of moisture;
then cure it with wet cloths in butter or crushed herbs, until the place yields pus, and the burned flesh issues in the pus;
then cure the wound with ointments, strong and penetrating into hard flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches down to the bottom, and is far from the body, then put your finger in the bottom and explore it.
If you feel a membrane, and between it and the tissue or skin, or it is close to piercing, then there is no other way than hope and faith, by the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you place plasters and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tissue that holds the bottom, and the expulsion occurs against your will. then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it, once it is cut away from the base, or with a plaster or another suitable instrument; then cleanse the injured flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the outside of the base:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the outside of the base: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the base next to the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And put one thread twisted into two, and put the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the margin of the base within, then pull out the thread from that hole, as if you put your finger in the base;
and pull the head of the thread, and join the two heads together, and hold one to the other, and leave it for one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, so that the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not appropriate to make the lacing cut so deep, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the spatumile spine, with which one opens the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and often blood flows from them, and there is one or more of them, and they are under the fundament and at the head of the fundament;
but those that are underneath have little moisture, and often discharge a little of yellowish water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure for those who have them inside the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the privy, until the fundament gives way, and the threads appear; if you hurry, and pull it with pliers, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the tweezers cannot hold them because of their moisture, then they are taken with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamelot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle some hot powders on top that are in the place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the foundation cannot come out, then give the patient a mordant and harsh clyster to wash what is in the foundation, so that it can come out openly; If the patient complains, and if the threads are loose from the foundation, then the cure is light;
If the patient complains, and if the threads are loose from the foundation, then the cure is light; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or pliers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear incision by iron. Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread and put it into a needle, then pull the thread above and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and pull out the needle, and do thus with all the others, and leave one to run the excess of blood;
then place upon the base a damp cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and place upon the base, and instruct the patient that he rest;
and then leave it until they fall, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointment and other treatments, until they are healed.
of the drying of the base. Many times there is drying of the bowels in the intestines, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine does not help. If it is necessary, you should scrape the scab off with a spatula or your fingernail, which should not be allowed to become moist. then treat it until it is healed as is appropriate.
and if it cannot heal, scrape it again more forcefully than before, until it is quite sore and scabbed over. then treat it until it is healed.
then it trembles. A formice is a small, false appearance around the body, and goes very deep.
and sometimes it finds cold, and it is felt just as though trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a stick made of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick over the trembling, so that the circle surrounds the trembling entirely. then turn your hand to the entire stick so that you cut around the trembling, and put it deep, and pull the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of brass or iron according to this shape, and let it be thin underneath and sharp above: not pierced, so as to hold it to the finger, and to press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as it is before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes one makes a clyster of silver or of archaut, or of melted or hammered brass;
and sometimes one makes these instruments small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which one administers in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those then which one administers in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wide at the top, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there be a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the head be pierced within;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have one thread of space between each hole, then put one strong thread of twisted thread into each hole in an X or around, and gather the belly as if it were a goat; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and that is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar thing, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is all empty, then remove the clyster, and the patient raises their legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let it come out as much as it can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you administer the clyster in a disease of diarrhea, and the medicine is quick to leave, repeat it until it is cured.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster by which the skin is squeezed:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures of hands and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of stones, and the cutting of swords and knives, or of lances or wood or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, like a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, so take care if it is from throwing stones or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you doubt the rise of a hot abscess: if you make it bleed immediately from the cephalic, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the blood flow opposite the wounded part;
and keep the patient from repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be reduced, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it has not been altered by the air, a powder, which I will tell a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with tents, bring them together by stitching, as I will say about wounds of the belly, of the ribs.
If the wound is exposed bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, cut it off; then cure the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of leather, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as roasted meats and cooked wheat, as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the leather, and it is not reaching the bone, cut out all the rot, and throw it away, then cure it;
and if there is an artery in the wound or vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, then find the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if this does not work, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is light: and put this powder in it so that the wound has healed.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; living coals three parts, and powder it subtly, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it without untying, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only coals, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burning has not changed the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, especially if it is, then one does not put this powder in it;
but puts on some digested ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it produces pus; then cures it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with subtle pincers;
and I will tell you afterwards the fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, it has no difference from one of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to let it heal, and put nothing constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soaked, like warm wash in soft water, and mixed with rose oil, and the decoction also in soft water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, then pierce it in a lower place;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding results, then cauterize it, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passageway is protected, through which food goes, then stitch the heart to the cartilage of the throat, and do not touch the throat but return it to its natural shape; and then restrain the swelling, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then dig it out; and if there are pieces of bone, then remove all that you can, and those that you cannot get, then leave them until the wound has festered, and the exit has separated and become clear;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, then observe if gases escape from the wound as the patient breathes: Then know that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, then do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly due to the blood, lest it lingers deep, and returns to the heart, and kills the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, then place old cotton in the wound to absorb any moisture, and make the patient sleep over the wound for three days, or four, or more; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the veins; and when you see good conditions, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with bandages and other remedies, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, then know that there is a fistula;
if you treat it as you should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it like the wound that is on the front. if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder; and if it is deeply embedded in the bone, and has broken pieces, then treat the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, so the extraction will be easier;
and the judgment for other wounds on other limbs is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are great, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, so that they get entrapped;
and the treatment is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, if one does not put them back in quickly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are more difficult to return, and therefore a medium wound is better, because it is easier to return the intestines to their place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common treatments occur in the treatment of the belly, and the treatment of other wounds of the body and two other treatments specific are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more specific to the treatment of the belly, and I will explain each one.
I say that when the wound is small, and some thing of the intestines protrudes, and it is difficult to return, it is by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in just warm water, or boil it in water with saffron, and cypress, and spices, and warm the intestine until the swelling is gone;
and sometimes use astringent wine, and it is more effective than water alone to reduce swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water or cooked mallows and aloes, for by this the entrance to it is eased by little.
and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound a little with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut;
and the first treatment is more effective than the incision, and no one should make an incision without great necessity.
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
if it cuts within the curve and not outside, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, then return it behind according to the natural form into its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part beneath the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part beneath the belly, then raise the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then focus on making the injured part higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, use what is appropriate, then have in your hands a skillful physician who holds the entire rupture in their hand, and brings the edges together;
and that is the common method of stitching, and it is that you take a needle or several, according to the size of the wound, then leave a space of one inch from the beginning of the wound, and insert a needle with a strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the underlying skin, until you have pierced through that part, and join the two edges of the underlying skin together;
then tie a double thread around the needle from both sides, then join the two edges of the wound together, and then leave one inch of space, and insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not stop doing this, according to what you need for the needles, until the whole wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and too thick ones cannot enter well: Therefore, they must be medium;
and you must not push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and widen the wound before it is closed;
and then cut the points of the needles, so they do not injure the patient while they sleep, and put threads or bandages on the points of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles are sufficient.
The second method is common, and is that you join the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh together with one needle and a strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together, then draw the needle back to the starting point, in the manner in which one sews cloth;
and put a space between each stitch the size of a little finger;
This method is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and intestines were protruding about two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I brought back the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was sewn up within fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with any ointment, because I was in a place where no ointments or other medicines were found. and I would place old cotton over the wound twice a day, and wash it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of sewing.
Take the needle and bring it out from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right in the right, then leave the tip of the thread or the stitching where you put the needle, and pierce it again from the inside to the outside.
And the understanding of this stitching is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread one time on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is completely finished.
The second manner of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
Place a needle at the near end of the thread, and pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread. Then turn the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread.
Then pierce each from the outside to the inside, at two other ends of the thread that are on the other side.
And this is the best and most common manner of stitching.
Galen said this, and some bear witness, that one should sew the belly with two needles, each with thread.
And one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the fresh wound with all its blood, before the burning has changed it, you return the intestine to its place and sew it up;
Then put on powdered, healing flesh, and if the burning has changed it, put on any ointment that is available, until the wound heals. And stitch the threads, and let the suture and the bandage be bound. Then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed.
And if you have no medicine, then as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in addition, when the wounds are simple.
And if you doubt that the wound might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak light wool in tempered oil, or rose oil, and put it around the joints, and under the armpits.
And if it feels pain or rot in the boils, and this often happens, then irrigate them with heated dark wine, especially if the rot reaches the intestines.
And pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is due to the network of veins in it, and the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the hernia jumps out of the wound, replace it just like the intestine, while it's fresh.
And if it is old and turned dark or black, you must tie the dark area to prevent blood from flowing, for there are veins and arteries there.
Then cut what is between the tie, and hang the two ends of the part below the wound out, so as to ease the extraction when the hernia falls, and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the abdomen.
When the intestine is wounded, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people, for I saw a man wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became chronic and turned into a fistula, and waste and gas were discharged from it;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and I did not cease to apply remedies until it was healed, and the area was joined together.
And when I saw it healed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: take a strip of strong fabric, then bring the edges of the wound together, and when the strip has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges so that it firmly closes over them;
and then cut off the strip's end, and this stays in place so it cannot come undone, then place another strip in the same way as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and stitch the wound.
This method works on the intestines, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestines with a thin thread cut from an animal's intestine, in this way:
take the end of this intestinal thread, which should be very thin, and then tie a thin linen thread to the end of the thread, then put the thread in the needle and sew the intestine, and bring it back together to repair the tear;
and this method of sewing with strips is nothing more than following the path of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines, there is no skill or remedy, but only subtlety.
of a fistula or wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it has lingered, is universally called a "fistula," especially when it is festering and filled with pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where no pain is felt, and is also festering like the feather of a bird;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes small, and other times quite large;
and I have spoken about this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, is not caused by anything except one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or the body; or by its malice; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the material is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a manner of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow to digest, and delays recovery, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of the fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that fistula happens in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal limb, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of grievous healing, and there is only labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have said, and you have confidence in its cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then seek it with a thin lead tent, for lead bends easily around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot well seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will run from one opening to another, and clean it;
then seek it wisely to your power, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and is deep inside, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the corruption and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and straight, you must cut deep, as much as you can, then place moistened tents in a sharp medicine, and put them down to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed by this, cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If a vein or nerve bothers you or the main limbs, as we have said;
And if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, remove it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that promote flesh growth until it is healed;
And if it is not healed, and returns to its former state, know that you have not gone to the root of the problem:
if you uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with pincers, pull it out with an instrument suitable for this, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, and leave none;
and if the moisture resists, and there is no mistake or fear, then cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put on the wound something that will cause rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be easier to remove;
and if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, then only restrain the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and reaches the marrow of the bone; then it should be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then cured until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and help in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter reached his leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no reason to avoid opening it;
but the physicians, in their folly, worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared that all emitted pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatments for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating it, and what flowed through the holes with great force; and the young man's body was becoming red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then searched all the holes, and found that one was coming against the other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered part of the bone, and I found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption reached the bone inside;
I cleaned away what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with healing remedies for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and I cleaned it, and then removed it, and I struggled to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a palm's width of bone, and the wound was completely exposed, then I restored it with remedies; and it was quickly healed and healed, and no further work was needed except for the patient's weakness, who could not endure, and because of the fear of death I had for him. For because of the bloodletting, he often coughed, but he was completely healed, and a hard tissue grew in place of the bone, and was of good disposition and had no harm or opposition at all, neither in the present nor in the future.
And if the bone is broken in any place on the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a bandage, and tie it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is over the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downwards, and expose the flesh above the place where you want to work, so that the wire does not pierce the flesh;
and place a brand or a board under the bone to help cut the corrupted flesh;
and work this way as long as you can see and feel the corruption, and do this again and again.
And if the bone is corrupted, and is not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then expose all the flesh;
then place a brand underneath, and then cut along the corruption from one side to the other, and let the cut be the length of the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and cut the bone where it is on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the finger of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways that you can, but do not let the vein or nerve hinder you;
and know that the tools and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore, for each type of work, it is necessary to prepare its own tool;
and know that the work will show you the tool you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the types of illnesses; therefore, consider the tool you need, according to what is suitable.
The shoulder can dislocate either inwardly or outwardly;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do no good, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to where the corrosion is, so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the limb.
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, that corrosion spreads from limb to limb, and takes hold throughout the body;
so hurry to cut it, and if it is from the sting of some venomous creatures, like sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it and do not give it space to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not spread to the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and there are no strong remedies that equal the extent of its power;
and thus do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot; and if it ascends the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the method of cutting or severing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and have some attendants pull one of the bandages downwards, and other attendants the other bandage upwards, and you separate the flesh between the two bandages to a width of one span, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or sever it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the severed part does not touch the healthy area, and the patient does not suffer further injury or infection.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
he had a dark discoloration that looked like a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came to his toe of the foot, until it affected his entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling things after cleansing his body, and the corrosion could not stop;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired entirely, and returned to his land, and quickly cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have written this account only so that others might do likewise if they have need.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy area, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then bursts and punctures, and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an ailment is called "sain," and not "fistula";
but if it is so prolonged that it reaches down to the bone deep within, then it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you should cut the skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not become worse due to its corruption.
And if you suspect that the skin is inflamed, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with an enema thus:
See if the swelling is large, and the discharge from it has a foul odor, then treat it with an enema of Egyptian medicine, which is made like this: Take vinegar, oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine turns red and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it with water and honey, and inject it into the swelling, and compress the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this often, until the swelling is healed and the odor is gone;
and sometimes, when this medicine is not available, enemas of ash water are given, where you take ashes from a vine branch, pour water over them, and let it settle, and use it for an enema, until you know the swelling is thoroughly cleaned;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then give him an enema of water and honey, or a little ground litharge; or you give him an enema of honey and diluted wine, for the honey has the property of cleaning and washing, and the wine helps dry the swelling;
and when you have done this, and are confident that the swelling is thoroughly cleaned, then give him an enema of what will cause flesh to grow there, and take a diaphanous plaster made with rose oil and wine;
or you give him an enema of some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have discussed when dealing with ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tip of the enema cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too large, then stitch it, leaving only the area where the enema can enter, and if the discharge opening is on top, cut it or at a lower location.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the swelling runs to the lowest possible location; for when the swelling is deep, it will not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a way: that the swelling runs easily downward, and leaves nothing of the swelling;
that the swelling runs easily downward, and leaves nothing of the swelling; and take consolidating medicines to put over the wound, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the entire wound; then cut as strongly as necessary at the opening of the wound, a bit wider than the first one; then spread a soft ointment onto another cloth, according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the wound to ease the swelling, and do not remove the large cloth entirely except once after many days;
and the one that is over the opening of the wound, remove frequently to remove the swelling, and know whether what flows from the swelling is venom, pus, or sufficient, or digested, or indigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine is spread in such a manner, and you see the nature that rises above the opening of the wound, know that the wound is healing now, and health is approaching;
and then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men for whom the healing of flesh in their wounds takes a long time, and others who do the opposite;
And if indigested swelling bursts from the wound after many days, know that the wound is not healing;
And if the wound is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as ointments defined, for there is a great part of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
Take diafinit ointment, and they make it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with equal parts old wine;
Then apply it and use it;
And this same thing works better cooked and thickened, when diafinit ointment is unavailable, or you take myrrh and aloes and frankincense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is over the fire;
And then stick it with a bandage, and spread it over the wound, and sometimes an experienced herbalist applies long iris roots, and roots of the celestial lily, which is like the flour of vetch and centaury; And use it in simple or compound forms: Grind them, and make a powder, and put it over the honey I mentioned, and use it;
And if the cure is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep-seated, and is causing pressure on the bone, or the hard tissues, or the ligaments; If the cure for the fistula, as we have said before.
Panaricium is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises in other toes;
And when it has aged, and one does not take care of it, then a hot abscess arises and runs and casts pus until it runs to the root of the nail, and perhaps it runs the whole nail;
And the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is foul pain, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, you must cut away all the excess that remains of the nail with a hot iron, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy;
And if the nail presses against the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, you must put a wedge under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upward, and carefully and gently cut away the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove it all. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it, and remove it forcefully, for as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger decaying, cut it in half as previously described, then treat it until it is healed.
And if it is struck, and pushed, and feels great pain, you must first heal it.
Then cut the nail of the spatulim with a sharp blade, cutting across it, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh underneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain.
And if it happens, put something on that soothes it.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some people by chance is all fleshy, and sometimes it has bones, and sometimes a nail, and some of them arise at the root of the joint, or the origin is in some of the fingers.
The one that arises on any part of the finger does not change, and the one that arises at the joint of the finger, perhaps changes.
The size of the fleshy one is small, in this way: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
The one that arises at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: So hold it from cutting.
In that which arises or ought to arise at the back, you must first cut the round flesh down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable blade for that, then treat it until it is healthy.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from a wound's healing, or from a fire burn, or from similar things.
You should cut that swelling, so that the fingers repair according to their natural shapes; then place between two tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not fuse together; or you place between two pieces of thin lead, until the place is healed as it should be.
If swelling comes to any of these fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as appropriate.
Veins are large veins wrapped up, full of melancholy superfluities, that come in many members of the body;
and more happen in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you give him an emetic at times, and then the root of the basilica.
The cure of iron is according to two manners: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other manner is that you tie the vein, and draw all the blood out.
The cut is according to this manner: First, apply a very hot water to the leg, so that the large blood is refined, then hold the patient's leg from the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, or two or three places, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood to your hand, from one end to the other, as much blood as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bandage it, and instruct him to eat foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harm the patient.
The raising of it is according to this method: raise the patient's leg, if it has much hair, then put it in a bath, and warm the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you have no bath, then heat it by fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the area below the ankle;
then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein from each side, until it appears when touched;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin, it seems like a white cord;
then put the knife underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then cut it with the knife lightly, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin above the vein until it appears, then lift it with the knife, as you did before, and cut it with another knife, as you did first;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it and cut it at the toe, then pull it and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a very strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a knife underneath, and turn your hand back and forth until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put moistened wool on the wound's location in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vision is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it twistedly, but do not cut it at all; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vision is curved, and does not cut straight, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of large curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but be thick as we have said, and this is the form:
This vein is intertwined in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes beneath the skin, just as it comes inside the body of serpents and worms, intertwined between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap around a piece of lead from one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time a bit comes out, wrap it around the lead and the knot;
and if it is too long, cut off a portion, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is completely out. for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh and cause an abscess and rot in that place and a bad illness;
because of which thing it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long or ten, and a man came to me, from whom it issued ten palms long, and when you cut it, it opens one vein or hole, and pierces it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and the matter within be emptied, and administer remedies to the place to prevent any rot for a while, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes appear in it, and from which many branches spring.
Then treat it as we have said before.
of worms that grow between skin and flesh This ailment is called "ox disease" in our land, because it frequently occurs in oxen, and is a small worm that grows between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one feels it clearly moving from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin wherever it goes, and causes pustules to form;
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, as are worms and serpents and leeches and ascarids in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body and ascends to the head, and it reaches the eye, it may, by chance, enter and destroy the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to treat and extract it, one can only do so when it moves.
so it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above it and pull it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize it with fire above it, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it causes is that it infects the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming towards the head near the eye, then firmly press the eyebrow below it, then cut above it, and pull it out forcefully;
and the patient should use cleansing remedies and dissolving medicines for the bad putrid humors, and should avoid foods that promote putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that occurs in some limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw that which I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and I saw it rise afterwards, like a worm on the shoulder, faster than anything, like quick silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain left that spot, and settled into the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it went to the other arm;
then she told me that it went around the body repeatedly, just as I saw it.
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way. However, I had seen many others who had seen pain move from one place to another, but I had never seen it like this in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and the veins exposed, and for that the constriction appeared.
and it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then treat it from above and below quickly, and then cut until the constrained wind from the place is released. and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with those that expel winds, like fetid pills, and pills of seraphim, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places on the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some with large points, and small, and barbed, and welded; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some that have pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in chief members, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls then in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: if you must then abstain from the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterward in many dispositions; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls into it and pierces the bone, and the skin over the brain is torn, are when there is blindness and suddenness and weakness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is blood coming from the nostrils or the ears; and perhaps loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes white moisture resembling pus, and also burning flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, then consider the treatment, and pull out the arrow if it is not inside.
The sign of an arrow hitting the heart is that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not empty. And perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and black blood flows out, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting. Then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow that hits the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, the throat swells, the patient's complexion changes, and they sigh loudly and seek cold air.
And if the arrow hits the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs. and causes great pain and great sorrow and sighing. and all the shoulder members move.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, perhaps some undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow hits the belly, and some straw leaps out through the intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for removing the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows away, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, shoulder joint, spine of the back, arms, thighs, and legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I removed it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healthy without trouble.
And I removed an arrow that had struck him in the eye's fat under the eyelid below, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft.  The arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, and light as any iron arrow without feathers.
The man was healthy, and no bad accident occurred.
And I removed an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with feathers:
I soothed the swellings, and proceeded carefully until I removed it, and the Christian was healed.
And I removed an arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and I thought he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, he did not change his condition at all; I cut around the arrow, and extracted it, and it was fully removed, and there was no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow struck his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and his wound was closed over; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I treated an arrow in a man of the king's princes, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been embedded for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and felt nothing. and it felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I applied a drawing and digestive plaster to the area, so that the area wouldn't swell. And the wound from the arrow appeared.
And the wound from the arrow appeared. I applied the plaster again, and the wound healed completely, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead inside his nose.
And he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound repeatedly until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow becoming loose in the wound.
Then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow became clearly visible.
And the wound remained open for about four months, then it grew wider so that I could insert pliers and move it from side to side, but it would not come out.
Then I continued to devise and experiment with various instruments, until I finally used strong pliers, according to the method described at the end of this chapter, so that I extracted it and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Or I have told you the nature of extracting certain arrows, so that you may apply your treatment to what I have not said, because the book cannot encompass everything.
But the wise masters, looking at even small things, and at what is present and deficient, invent new works and new instruments for the removal of strange occurrences that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs where they are stuck except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that goes out through where it enters, this is an arrow that has entered into fleshy places, and sometimes goes out immediately.
And if it does not go out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it has rotted, and the exit is eased;
and if it is stuck in the bone, and cannot come out, leave it like that for several days, and move it each day;
and then it will come out, and if it doesn't, pierce around it with a very fine tool, until the surrounding area is enlarged, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged within the body where it cannot be seen, then seek it throughout the entire area; and if you feel it, remove it with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound and the arrow's depth, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins, then enlarge the wound;
and remove the arrow if you can; and if the arrow has barbs by which it is held, remove the flesh that is pierced by the barbs as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow until you can remove it;
and carefully ensure that you do not break the arrow, so that you can remove it more easily.
And if you cannot remove it at once, leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then remove it, for the extraction will be easier. And if the bleeding is making you uneasy, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can remove the arrow without danger, quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and place the patient according to the form he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest aid there is; and if you cannot, place him according to the signs they show you.
The arrow that comes from another place, or if anything is visible from it, or the skin is swollen in a place that can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it until the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then start pulling it out again until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in it, push it all the way through with the shaft;
and if the shaft fell, and you want to administer a push, then administer a sharp instrument so that the arrowhead enters the tip of the instrument;
and then push firmly, and if the arrow is sharpened, push an instrument with a pointed end into it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow hits the foot or the belly or the bladder or the side, and it is close, and you can cut above it, then cut there;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then remove it, and then stitch up the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the tongs used to remove arrows is similar to the beak of a bird, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is like the feather of a bird, to push at the tip of the arrow, like this is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two arteries that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins that are on the neck; and the two veins that are on the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly bled from are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and is above the fossa, and is the one from which one bleeds, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the "salvatelle" is the vein that is between the ring finger and the pinky finger, and has two branches;
and in the leg and foot are three veins: one is under the curve of the shin on the left side, and the second is the saphenous one at the ankle on the right side; and the vein called "nesse," which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins beneath those.
The bleeding of the veins that are near the ears helps with old colds and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the spot where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient strains their neck with a vise, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: then take them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand to the entire vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein in two with your two fingers, and make the blood come out as much as you want;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already said about incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and gout, and habitual ophthalmia, and for acute tearing in the eyes;
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I say: and it is that the patient should tighten their neck, so that the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from the inside;
then lift the heart above the vein towards your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you did with the two other veins, and make the blood flow according to your need;
then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place some cotton on it; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
The bloodletting from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bloodletting from the cephalic vein in illnesses of the face, old ones, and migraines, and inflammation;
and the method is that the patient tightens his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "the digger," of which here is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and press upon it with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to issue according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein so that it is healed and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, it is not necessary for the flame to be too sharp; and hold it sideways, for the bone is near, and perhaps the flame will break when it is thin.
The cautery of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts aids the eyes, and the eyelid, and redness, and the ulcer in the eye, and the illnesses of the face;
and the quality of their cautery is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting with a bandage, as before;
then cauterize, and let the cautery be across, a little bit long, a little bit wide of the flame, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind over with cotton, and bind it well.
The cautery of the vein of the nose is good for ague, and for sudden madness, and for facial ailments, like migraines and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
and the procedure for the cautery is that the patient should tighten their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long flame and place it between the lip, in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein is not clearly visible there, and the blood will now begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
The cautery of the two temples aids in constriction of the throat, and in the beginning of a fever, and in many diseases, and in impetigo, and in ulcers, and in herpes, and in boils;
and the procedure for the cautery is that the patient should tighten their neck from both sides, as we have said;
and let the master be standing over the patient's head, and let the patient sit upon a chair, then cauterize the vein along a small area, and draw the blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and tie both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the cautery of the lips The cautery of the veins of the lips above helps with running sores in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and surrounding areas.
And the qualities of the cautery are to make the patient sit in front of you, and tighten their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one being on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by being dark, and because around them are small dark veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and are in doubt, then cut the largest one on each side, and likewise do with the two veins that are above and below, because it is the same manner.
Of the cautery beneath the tongue The cautery of the veins beneath the tongue helps after the cautery of the cephalic vein, and is for the tightening of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and for diseases of the mouth;
And the quality of the cautery is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts the tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a dark vein:
Then cauterize one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are underneath.
The veins of the chest that are commonly cauterized are cauterized according to two methods:
or by piercing with a broad, pointed flame, or a subtle, olive-like cutting tool, and it is called "anesil"; and are broad or subtle according to the breadth and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flame-pointed cautery tool is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And is useful for opening the hair-like veins full of visible thick blood, and that contain thick and troubled blood; and that is the shape of the olive-pointed cautery tool:
and is more subtly pointed, and is for lancing the subtle veins, where there is subtle yellow blood.
The lancing of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps the ailments that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the lancet-wielder that he lance wisely, and that he guard against the artery that is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a hemorrhage of blood comes, then it must be stanched, as I have said; And the flame should not be pricking, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you must constrict it, and change to another one; or you want some branch of it, or you lance into the vein in the middle of the arm instead: it appears clearly; and cut with the knife flame, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the location for the lancing, then first you should constrict the arm, so that you touch the location until you feel the pulse; then mark the location with a point, then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a burning knife; and be careful not to hit the artery when you see the area inflamed, for it is from the artery: Then wipe it.
And if you see it emerge upward like a child's urine, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and place your finger on it for a while, then remove your finger if the blood stops, as often happens; Bind the arm, and leave it like that, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be careful, and not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is open, for the head is pulling it away; and stop the blood.
And take a fig bark, and split it, and take one of the halves, and bind it firmly until the other day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
And the stopping of it is not difficult in many conditions due to the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's bandage.
The vein's bleeding in the middle aids in drawing blood from the head above and the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
And the practitioner must be careful of the nerve below, and if it pierces too deeply, and finds the nerve, it swells and the wound is difficult, and perhaps will not heal;
And this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men due to its subtlety, then you should cauterize it with a cauterizing instrument. And cauterize the nerve as much as you are able.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes.
And it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive-shaped vein or the myrtle-shaped vein, for it is the safest of all veins, as it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the easiest spot, and do no harm if one fails the first time, and one tries again. And perhaps the spot swells in some people when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and one should bleed in the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to illnesses has no set time, but that when needed, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and it is not fitting to bleed children until fourteen years old, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. And the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a mild clyster, if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
Nor should those who are overly full of food, or who are drunk, as long as they are intoxicated, or those who are hydrops, be bled;
and one should be wary of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and loose bowels, and multiple pregnancies in women, and labor, and prolonged wakefulness and fasting, and anything that drains all the strength, either of the spirit or the body;
then thin out the humors, if the blood is thick, through food and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm near the third, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and from hardship, and from lust, and from similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands, until the veins swell and can be felt;
then the bleeder moistens the flame with a little old oil, then puts his left hand's finger on the vein under the area where he wants to bleed, so that the vein doesn't burst and fail when he strikes.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is put on, it recoils, and the vein cannot open, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be careful in these matters.
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good; if not, then try again a little below that spot or above it quickly, if the spot is not swollen.
And if the spot is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come.
do not enter a bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear it will not release as much blood as you want, then apply fire directly to the opening itself;
and treat it a little hastily, before the spot is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the area swollen, then do not restart the bleeding, and apply a little linseed oil, for it thins the blood, and linseed is gentler in this place than oil;
and thus administer linseed oil to each bleeding you make to the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and this same thing does heal and soothe them, when put on the area; so it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which happens many times, especially when the bleeding is not sufficient to the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and place on the area a sponge moistened in warm water and salt, and keep it on for an hour;
and it is necessary that you do this after the blood leaves the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does no harm; and if you wish, put on some aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance happen with the bleeding of the basilica:
Then place your hand on it, and if you find the area soft to the pressure of your hand, then that appearance is bad. Therefore, do not put anything on it that we have mentioned, for perhaps it is flowing from the artery.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
And draw from each of the blood according to the quantity of its virtue, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it issue until it is red. and if you see it thick, let it be until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is fitting for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the incision be wide.
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and let him be bled little and often, and he should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking.
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than letting blood from long or wide incisions.
And to one whose body weakens during bloodletting, give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If he is hot, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold disposition, before the bloodletting, let him eat bread soaked in syrup of roses, or in syrup of aromatic honey with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-smelling syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the flow of much blood, he should drink broth of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things we have said in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wants to let air out of his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by extensive bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the amount of his continuous strength.
And whoever wants to let air out of their arm after the first bleeding, and they have a strong body, let them bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw out a large quantity, and widen the opening so that it drips in abundance; after you have observed all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on their pulse while they bleed, so that death does not come in place of abundance, and this happens many times when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not appropriate when you wish to release the arm, and make blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press firmly upon it; or if it is bent, that he extend the arm quickly, for that would be bad.
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the tip of the flame, so that the blood that has clotted in the opening of the vein flows out forcefully, and put a small piece of salt mixed with water on it, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it at all until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, then bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is lanced in place of the vein of the head because it is compound.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the veins are red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears clearly, then bleed through the middle, not from the side nor lengthwise;
and let the opening be wide, and let it bleed well near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot issue forth, then put the hand back into hot water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back into hot water, for one puts it more into water in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the vein of the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in hot water, until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if the blood flows sideways, and if you cut it completely across, nothing will harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in hot water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, then put oil and a bandage on the vein to quickly close it, and do the same for each vein.
The bloodletting in the left hand is good for the disease of mice, and do everything as I have told you for the right.
Bloodletting from the saphena vein is good for all diseases below the body, such as diseases of the groin, and retention of flowers, and diseases of the kidneys, and of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the method of this bloodletting is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it bursts, and binds the joint of the foot. and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot many veins go.
So bleed it then at the larger vein, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed it above the foot, watch out for the nerves below, and bleed through as if cutting.
and let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, return the foot to the water and let the vein empty well.
And if the lancing fails the first time, start again a little higher the second time, for the place is sore.
and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do likewise on the other foot's sole.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the ankle of the foot, and its lancing is worthwhile for hip pain, when it's due to hot blood.
And the quality of its lancing is that the patient enters a bath, and tightens above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, lance it in every way you can, and in a crosswise manner; and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very responsive to hands.
and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very responsive to hands. And if you do not find it, lance any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, and then loosen the bandage, and place cotton on it and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cups are made of horns, or of brass, or of glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping that is without striking is in two ways: either by total fire, or without fire;
and cupping that is done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is right on top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others in the two sides of the neck; and the cupping under the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the hips; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping on the two legs; and the cupping on the two ankles;
and the cupping does not draw much blood, except for small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not weaken one, as does bloodletting from a vein; and it is not appropriate to administer it, either with fire or without fire, in any disease that comes from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, due to the necessity of illnesses or custom, cupping is needed, administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle, and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we instruct them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The leeches from the temple assist the pressure on the head...that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the entire body;
and this cupping is in place of the leeching of the cephalic vein, and it is not appropriate for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for it does them much harm;
and for this reason, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And those who often bleed from it become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cup a little lower due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilica vein, and therefore it is good for tightness in the breast, and for a fissure in the windpipe, and for coughs, and for congestion.
And it should be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it induces forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilica vein.
And you should instruct the master to press his hand firmly upon applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for gum decay, and similar illnesses in the mouth. And it is a substitute for bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for diseases caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as effective as bleeding from the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins.
And instruct the master not to press too deep, for the area is bare of flesh, and lies beneath nerves and arteries.
Cupping on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for diseases below, and the cup should be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were small, it would break. And it makes large wounds.
Cupping on the legs bleeds openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains in the kidneys, and bladder, and remove the impurities.
And are in the place of the two shins, and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause swelling in many dispositions.
The method of applying the cupping is to first place it empty, and suck gently, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease from this, until you see the area red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then, lift it, and replace the cupping glasses, and watch the condition of the body, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: So it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep. and suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the way of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw little by little blood, we need only one strike. And if we want much blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the outcome is that the heart is pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick and hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with arousing and dissolving oil: whether it is of violet oil, or of sweet almond oil, or of pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, of cress oil, or of lily oil, or of chamomile oil, or other similar one.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take amarantin oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and the similar ones.
And if the one who is cupped has tender skin and large pores, one should not put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or blackberry water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or other similar one.
And those who have much moisture, let them be lifted with willow or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities are lifted with old wine, or with sea water, or with a decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar ones;
and one should not be cupped with a cupping glass before a bath or in a bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he wash himself when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And be careful if the one who is being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in moderation, and similar things; and eat poults, and hare's meat, and moist meats.
and eat poults, and hare's meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat poults and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he will take a purgative, he ought to drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before the purgative, or afterwards, to strengthen the principal limbs; and let the blood be diluted, but it is by no means fitting that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping that is applied without striking is that which is applied to the liver, and the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the flank and the kidneys and the hip, for those limbs do not endure being struck on them, and one does not apply it there except to draw blood from limb to limb, just as we apply it to the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, just as we apply cupping to the belly and the flank to thin the limb;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or a stone, and it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus does it when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cuppings are administered empty just to suck; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in illnesses of the pleurisy, and in this manner one fills the cupping with warm water alone, or with water in which one has boiled suitable herbs for this.
The form of the cupping administered with fire is thus:
And have two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, as for putting in a needle, and be of bronze, soft in front so that it does not harm the patient when placing it on the limb;
and have in the middle a crosswise rod of bronze or iron, for putting in a lit candle, and there be both large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who take them;
for the cuppings of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a lining, and place it in the middle of the cupping through the rod that is in the middle of the cupping, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping so it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers be on the opening that we have spoken of, so that when one wishes, the vapor will go forth, and one removes the cupping;
and one takes the lining again as before, and one repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping, then, that is applied in a pleurisy, acute, there is no rod or opening, and it is only applied when it is full of water, and is placed upon the limb simply;
and this is the form:
Leeches are only applied to limbs where one cannot put cupping because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the toe or nose, and other similar places;
and the quality of their use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, soft, unblemished water, without any injury, then take them;
and place them in fresh water for a time, until they are well-filled, and have nothing in their stomachs; and then the patient should be bled from a vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where a cupping glass can be applied, then apply it, for this is very effective afterwards.
If not, then cleanse the area with warm water, and then dry it well;
and if the area heals too quickly after the leeches, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and apply it, until the blood is drawn out;
and if the blood is increased, then apply crushed vitriol, or gallstones, or similar things, until it is drawn out;
or you place half peeled beans on the area and leave them until they burn the area, it will now draw it out;
and if you need more, then take more leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to take hold, then rub the area with fresh blood, or you pierce it with a needle until blood comes out, and then place them on it, and as soon as they smell the blood, they will adhere;
and when you want them to fall off, then sprinkle some powdered alum and salt, or ash, on them, they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools scorn this chapter, as if they never saw any of the ancient books, nor read a single letter in them.
And for this reason, the knowledge is rare in our land, for I never found any good one.
And I know nothing except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experiment, and by the custom of my life.
And I have described in this chapter what is contained within, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the sums of the words and the chapters where the wise place their understanding, and remain upon the truth, so that those who are proven may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break, dislocation, twist, or fracture occurs to anyone, you should quickly bleed the patient on either side, if nothing else prevents you, such as weakness of the body, or childhood, or old age. or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold meats, that is to say, cold joints, and the flesh of birds and young bucks, and drink no wine, and eat no fatty meats, and do not fill yourself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you are not in doubt of a hot abscess, nor of the spreading of matter in the limb.
if the patient returns to his former way of life.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that promote growth, or that have viscosity, such as boiled wheat in water, and rice, and marrow, and feet, and cow's belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals more quickly and easily.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or mend properly according to their nature due to the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is a treatment, to set the broken bone in strong bandages that hold and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and not to cut the work entirely, and therefore he must be nourished with hearty foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes in one direction, and another in a different direction, as when the tip of a feather for writing is sharpened.
For there is a fracture that goes in one direction, and another in a different direction, as when the tip of a feather for writing is sharpened. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each kind has its own method, and its own specific instrument in restoration, according to what comes to remember its place;
And the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that its place is twisted, and it shows clearly by pressing, and it sounds when the hand is pressed;
And when there is no twisting or sound when touched, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture;
But it may well have twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. If so, you should not move it by hand, but apply medicines that come later, and then hold it gently.
And know that a fracture that extends to the joint, and the two parts are separated, they must now be put in perfect alignment, lest a hot abscess come there;
and if a hot abscess comes there, leave it for a few days, until the abscess is calmed;
then put it in alignment as gently and wisely as you can, and know that the restoration of one is easier than that of one where there are pieces;
then hold it, as it should be later.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is split in two parts, whether it's the hand or the foot, or in your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you return all the additions to their places as gently as you can, and take care that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well in your hand if it seems to you that it is not quite right:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those who, through their work, cause heat and contraction of the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, then restrain the patient well so that he does not move it, neither when awake nor when asleep, nor when turning, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet in place, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet in place, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain; and be careful that it is put straight, that no twisting comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the fractured limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that fractured limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap with soft and subtle linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for wide bandages embrace the entire large limb, and bind it evenly on all sides, so that there is no mark;
then bind around light padding, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the entire bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture is then slightly separated;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large portion of the healthy place, then take another bandage, and turn it around again over the fractured place;
then go again to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then put linen padding or cloths between the bandages, until it is all even, then bind everything over the bandage, and then put your well-made splints on, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then put on something soothing to the abscess that is hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it like that for some days;
then tighten over your splints, and they should be half the width of a cleverly cut cane, or of wood from which cleaves are made, or of palm ribs, and should be according to this shape:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and also as long as is suitable for the limb's size or stature; then tighten over the splints just as you did for the first bandaging, then tie a suitable thread over it, as in the first bandaging over the fracture; tighter on top, gradually less so;
and the thread should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, like the works of fools who make their bandages from twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too fine, and it is not fitting that there be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the splints after tightening in healthy places, then place linen or wool padding under them, so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not appropriate to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints forcefully until after 5 days or 7, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess occurring.
And here is the method of ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains:
and it is that you take flour that adheres to the mill walls, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it. This is the common method of plaster for restoring fractures in many cases, especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take 3 drachms of abareis and ladani and enule and asafetida and gum arabic and mugat, each 10 drachms. Myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; Alechil 9 drachms; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; If the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial to many people.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: Take mugwort and comfrey, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloes, each 9 drachms; gum arabic 6 drachms; Armenian bole 10 drachms, and grind well, and mix with water or the white of an egg, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and for bones separated from their places, and it soothes the pain arising, and for the use of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and put it on the affected area.
This plaster does not heal, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pain.
Another method of plaster that heals broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of wild poppy, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for the healing of a broken bone and to reduce the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, one part of each.
and grind them, and mix with wine; and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water or water, and apply it.
Another stronger plaster than the first, for when a hard abscess comes after the limb is restored. Take roots of mallow, flaxseed, baluster, melilot, and plantain, and violet and chamomile flowers, one part of each. and grind them, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength anything other than a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and vismalve, and oak bark, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and watch to see if the patient feels no pain, and that the bone has not moved from its place; If not, do not remove it for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest, or swelling, then hurry, and remove it, and take the plaster away now;
and take a light cloth, and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply to the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is calmed; then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then place dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bandage for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is gone, then resume the gentle bandaging, and a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are entirely gone, and you need plaster and a bandage, then begin again, as you did at first.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what is seen, until the fracture heals and the flesh grows together.
Then restrain it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said before.
and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it. Then apply warm water frequently whenever you unbind it, every third day, and loosen the bandage a little.
By this work then comes nourishment to the limb, and amends quickly what foolish doctors do, who restore the limb crookedly.
It is bad, and such work is fearful, and I see no other remedy than to leave it alone and work it properly.
Many types of fractures exist, and diverse forms, and the causes are distinct;
For there are fractures caused by blows from a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the surface beneath the bone, like a branch or a log does; And for this reason this type of fracture is called "haunchure.
Where the sword cuts the bone from above, piercing it, and this type of fracture is called "absolute";
And the wound from these two fractures is great or small.
And if there is a blow-in, or a fissure, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, that approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or it is above the bone, and this wound is either great or small.
And if there is a wound that is embedded in the bone as thin as a hair, and the fissure is small, and therefore this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and it causes a piece of bone to move inwards, and the place is fractured as when blacksmiths strike on kettles; if a stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those whose bones are moist or soft, such as a child's head;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are detached, like splinters; and I will speak about it in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the detachment on them, and the examination by probes, and by the corrupted flesh on top.
The capillary appearance is known by this: when the bone is uncovered, and you rub on top, the broken black bone appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, be mindful of the patient's complications, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting, loss of understanding, extension, numbness, acute fever, eyes swelling and turning red, and other similar conditions, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you do not see terrifying complications, and you hope for healing, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person comes to you first, and it is in winter, then the bone should be removed before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone is corrupted, and the complications that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue covering the brain, then you must split the fractured part like this:
and you should take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and over the wound's surface as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a pus-filled abscess, then aid as necessary, and you should fill the area with cloths moistened in rose oil; and rest the wound until the pus-filled abscess is calmed, and be assured of any bleeding; then begin to remove the bone, and this is done according to two types of work:
One method is that you cut at a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then add another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of diverse incisions, some narrow and others wide, and pointed, and made of tempered iron;
and work gently, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it, rather than making incisions with awls, not deeply enough to pierce the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or circle above the point, so that the point does not pass through the bone;
and you need several, so that each one fits into its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have awls for all skulls;
and this is the form of the three types of awls:
The quality for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place an awl on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then reposition the awl elsewhere a little later, and do this all around, then cut with the knives the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you pull the bone out with your hand, or with any of the instruments you have, such as pliers, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, you must then cut the rough edges that remain on the bone using any other instrument similar to a knife, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other knife;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with poultices and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of work is that which Galen described, which is safer; and the ligament very strongly, and that is his saying. First, you must expose a part of the bone, where the fracture is apparent, so that, once you have uncovered that part, you place the head of this lancet-shaped incisor beneath the head of the fracture, whose shape is this:
And do not cut it on one side only, and it has a sharp edge on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike lightly with a small mallet, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and take good care of the cloth that is underneath;
if it is adhering to the bone, then remove it gently, for one removes it well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce through the cloth, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, then you must remove that rough spot, and remove the scales with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, to administer the most suitable one in each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Use larger rasps first, and then finer ones, and do not cease from doing this until it is well.
In each of the other cuts and subtle fractures, you must administer treatment according to its direction;
and this is something not to be overlooked by one who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not burden the surface, then administer another bandage on top, and do not bind it too tightly, only just enough to hold the wound;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess is soothed, then unbind it, and apply medicines like lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and of these things make powder, and place it over the wound, and apply remedies, healing without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will rot and fester, and great harm will come to the patient;
for when one places a biting substance on the surface, it will burn from above. Therefore, beware, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful without a doubt.
And if blackening appears there, only because of the medicine placed on it, that such a virtue has, then you should take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and mix them together, and put it on the surface; then treat it with the appropriate methods of treatment until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or one alone, for these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you should place your index finger in the nostril, and place the broken part of the nose against your index finger, and hold it in place, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and take care that the patient does not feel pain through your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you should place it even with the top of a stick a little thick.
And if the fracture is of two parts, do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess is calmed, then apply strips of linen to the bridge of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the strips be so thick that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say one should soak the strips in butter, and change them every day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be soaked in a mixture of egg white and flour; then leave the strip until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are put in the nose in place of strips, and a soft bandage is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if a boil comes to the nose while you are working on it, put a plaster or soaked cotton in rose oil, or a bit of diachylon.
And if a boil doesn't come, put a plaster on the outside, of millet flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light wicks on top, and do not tie the nose;
and if the nose fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with suitable instruments, then stitch the fissure, and treat it with things that bind flesh, and make it stick together, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this.
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead strips on it, until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only on the outside, and is not broken in two, except for the inside bumps, it can be easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inwards, and with the other hand, align it from the outside, and make it level.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, you must administer extension on both sides, until they are equal.
And if the teeth move or break, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a plaster on the fractured jaw, and put a double cloth over it; and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, equal, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it over it as best you can, and instruct the patient to rest and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed. and apply a plaster of flour from the mill, with plenty of egg or linseed flour, after you have removed the plaster;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition doesn't change, leave it until healed. Many times it is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, check to see if any piece of bone has been removed. If subtly removed with suitable instruments for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remains, close the wound, if it is large, and put suitable dressings on it to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The forceps break many times before, toward the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is breakage with a wound.
And the work is when the breakage is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck toward the part;
then place the fracture evenly with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor movement.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round sphere of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and make it as large as you need. and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the fracture evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it goes deep, then the patient must lie often on his/her back, and place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the attendants push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is raised.
And then align the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and carefully pull the pieces apart, and if the bone cannot join by any means, cut it with one of the incisions you have. but that you place this instrument under the forceps, to protect the surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two edges, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cauterize the wound, and if the opening is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, fill the wound with bandages and tents, according to its quantity.
And if a hot abscess comes, soak the bandages in rose oil, and oil, and wine, and put on.
The treatment of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone a plaster of mill powder and egg white, and place light cloths on top, and place a splint under the arm, if you need it; Then take a very large bandage, one palm wide, then put a double bandage over the cloths and the plaster; Then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the splint over the break, and turn the bandage over the shoulder, and under the healthy armpit, and under the sick armpit; and keep it in place on each side, and when you see that the splint holds the fracture in place, and you clearly see that the splint does not move from the broken bone, keep checking it daily, and when the splint loosens, tighten it;
and lay the patient on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; so that the fracture will be relieved from the strain by raising the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the shoulder, and do not loosen it until twenty days, unless bad accidents occur;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it needs it, and tighten and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in the most cases within twenty-eight days, and in fewer for some people.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a broad area or in the middle, and one only knows it is broken by feeling it;
if you align it according to the shape of the fracture, and reposition it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the area flour from the mill, with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and place over it a double cloth; then put over it a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is a gap anywhere on the shoulder, fill that gap with linen bandages, so that the splint lies flat;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the bandage every day;
and every time it softens, bind it more tightly, and make the splint level if it has moved from its place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that easily moves out of place.
And if a piece of bone protrudes forward, and is a little below the skin, cut it open, and remove it, and do as we have said in the chapter on treating abscesses by heat.
of the breaking of the breast.
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks at the edge.
And when it is broken in the middle, it declines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and a lack of breath, and sickness, and perhaps vomits blood, and the ends of the broken bone show, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and they put a cushion between the shoulders, then press the shoulders together, and join the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and subtly adjust it to all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
Then place plasters and bandages over the delicate bone fragments, or another light material, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs to be loosened, due to corrosion or itching that arises in the area, or pain or abscess, hurry and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and address whatever has occurred through appropriate treatments;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the broken ribs
Know that the breaking of ribs usually occurs only in the thick parts behind the back, and at the top inside, and they only break because they are brittle; and one feels it well upon questioning the sides.
And the restoration is that you set the break straight, as it should be. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the broken ribs are tilted inward, the patient feels great pain and pricking, as if from stabbing, because the bone is piercing the tissue; and breathes in gasps, and coughs and vomits great amounts of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have given much thought to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess appear, if it has not already. And if it has appeared, let it be treated.
And some of you say that one places cupping glasses on the spot, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping glasses will not draw superfluities to the spot due to its weakness.
And some of you say that one should cover the spot with wool soaked in warm oil, and place tents between the ribs to evenly apply the bandage around it, then be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, diet, and medicine.
And if the patient feels intense pain that he cannot bear from the bone piercing the skin, and doubt exists in the patient, it is necessary to cut into the spot where the rib is broken, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the surface.
And then one should cut the bone, and pull gently, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come, then place cloths moistened in rose oil on the area.
and treat the area as appropriate for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or stretch them, and when you prick them with a needle, they don't feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many ways, and if they move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the sick person will be cured, if treatment is given.
And if similar things happen to the spine of the back, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if the feet are softened, and if the accidents that are in the hands, and on the back, have wind and expulsion without will;
and when it is laid on its stomach, there is expulsion without will. And when it is laid on its back and it wants to sit up, it cannot. Know that it is mortal: Then do not labor in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come to him, the thing is less serious.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you put rosemary oil or egg oil on it until it is calmed;
then put one of the comforting and drying plasters on it, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut around the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed;
and if the bone of the arm, which is called the "arm bone", is broken, place your left hand's pouch on it, and try to set it straight with your other hand, then apply a plaster and splint, if you need them;
then bind it, and if there are any separated bones, cut around them, remove them, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is broken, and if it is, there is not much of a lessening at the head; and it cuts lengthwise, and tilts inward, and the patient experiences pain and throbbing, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you stretch your hand above, so that you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then place the fracture evenly, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it tilts inward, then make the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is apparent to you. And when you have put it in line, then place the plaster over it, then place a wooden or leather splint over it, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space below the ribs, so that the limb is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess comes there, do not touch it until the hot abscess is calmed, and place upon it what we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie to the two ends two straps, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place the broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang it over something heavy or the attendant stretches it downwards;
then let the attendant align the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that you support the patient on a stretcher, and tie the hand to their neck, then instruct two attendants that one holds that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds below with a strap, and each stretches to their side.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, tighten one strap below the fracture, and one above the fracture, and each of the attendants stretches to their side.
And if the fracture is close to the shoulder joint, you must place one strap below the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, you must place a strap lightly, without effort, until the fracture is aligned in its place, and towards the elbow;
then align the fracture as it should be, and secure it, if no suppurative swelling comes.
And if suppurative swelling appears, do not secure it for seven days, but place moistened wool in oil and rose oil until the suppurative swelling is calmed;
then secure it, and the manner of securing it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, then assemble the arm over the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and put a bandage and secure it over the shoulder and the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing hinders it, or if the bone is not dislocated.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, use splints, and place a splint wider and stronger than the others over the fracture, and have one finger's width between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends beyond the fracture three fingers on each side;
then secure the splints, as I have said at the beginning of the chapter concerning the fracture, more strongly and less as you move away.
And if you see the position of the splints and the tightening, as we have said, during the time you restore the fractured limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave it to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine the bandage every three days, to see that neither itching nor swelling occurs at the site, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it heals, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back and have their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion full of wool under the shoulder, and watch every hour of the day or night that the shape of the fractured limb does not move, or that the bandages do not soften;
if it heals by the power of medicine, and give it the food we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is initially subtle; and when it begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be recovered in forty days in all; and then it should be unbound and administered baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is bad and swollen, it remains unbound for 10 days or two months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearms", of which one is small, and is the one that surrounds the wrist;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, towards the little finger;
perhaps the large forearm is broken alone, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm is broken, the restoration is slight, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small forearm that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended gently, and put straight.
And if it is the large forearm, then it should be held tighter;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie crossed over himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no labor;
Then the minister extends his arm to the part below his hand, or to a ligament, and another minister to the other above.
And then let the minister put it straight, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture it is in pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any separated one that hurts the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the singular chapter; then take the cure.
And if in the beginning of the restoration there are hot abscesses, then apply a bandage of cerote made of rose oil and white wax, that it be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the bandage gently over it, until the hot abscesses are soothed.
And then remove the cerote, and apply a plaster of mill powder mixed with abundant egg white, then place the splints, and let the splint for the fracture be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints or more in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as you move away, as I have said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread with which it is bound be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And watch the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with warm water until the itching is relieved;
and let the limb rest, not too tightly bound.
And then reapply the bandage, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, and similar things, then adjust it.
And be careful that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not loosen it for up to twenty days.
or, in which case, then he hangs his hands around his neck, and keeps his shoulders level, and be careful of movement and handling, and sleeps on his back;
and know that this fracture will be restored in 30 or 35 days, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and the ends of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there is often only bending.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then place his hand on an outstretched surface, and let the attendants extend the broken bones, and put them straight, the attendants, until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess arises, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is within the back of the sole of the foot, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it against his fractured foot; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be of soft wood, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as is appropriate.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint on top, and another underneath on the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it entirely around the hand, and bind the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, set it straight, as is appropriate; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish you may place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and keep it still;
and if the fracture is in other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in a row, which is better, or you place a splint on top, as in the knuckle;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and help those who come to it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and it is clearly seen when it turns in front and behind;
and the restoration is done by binding one bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each minister extends their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And also if it is close to the knee, then let the bandage be next to the knee, and let the extension be downwards;
then let the physician place the bone equal with their two hands, so that it is according to its natural form, and then place the plaster, and bind it, if an abscess does not come there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; The treatment is done in this way.
You must wrap over the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and leave the excess, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and the end of the thread comes above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and thigh, then place strips over the fracture, and place a strip over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening equal, then begin to bind tightly three or four times over the fracture; and as you go higher over the fracture, tighten less;
then tie the two ends of the thread you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie three strips that are above, then go back below to the end of the thread, until you come next to the foot;
and tighten it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, so that no abscess or swelling or other similar thing comes to it. And if it happens, untie it, and correct what comes to it, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that prick, it must be extracted, if one can; and if one cannot, one must split the place, and pull forcibly; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are put in, as in the shoulder and the arm;
However, the patient does not limp in this way of restoring it.
And know that the thigh is restored in ten days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the knee joint, there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is not a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with all wounds, and without wounds, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is done by putting together what is broken in its place, as much as possible.
Then put a plaster, and put a round splint, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then follow all the instructions that we have given for other fractures, such as hot abscesses and others like them; So apply the appropriate treatment for each accident, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is called "tibia" and the other "fibula".
And any fracture happens there as it does to the arm, and for this, the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the treatment is the same. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns about in all directions.
And if the small bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is clearly seen. and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and place it straight, and bind the splints similarly;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be less and lighter; and treat according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap with two places one bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and with this binding, the leg will not deviate to the right or to the left, and thus it is well;
and some apply a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg upon it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the foot and the toes, and there is only a break or cracking in several different positions.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping, then place the patient's foot on the ground, as if he were trying to walk, and then place your foot on his, over where the bones are raised, and press until they return to their places;
then put the plaster and bandages on, and put a small board two spans long under the sole of the foot, then bind it to the foot securely, after wrapping cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, then realign them, just as we have said for the toes of the hand; then place a splint along the length of the fractured toe, and let it be a little wider, then place the board I mentioned under the foot, and bind it securely;
and if there are two or three, or more, fractured, then place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and secure the board under the foot; and let it be placed on the top of the board to protect the sole of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, which we have already discussed; and treat each accident as appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the forearm
When the bone of a woman's nature is fractured, make her sit in a relaxed posture, then incline her towards the back, and be held from behind;
then fill the patient's natural cavity with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then lift the woman up, and slowly raise her back, and then the cotton will pop out, until it reaches the opening of the nature, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do so for seven days or thereabouts: then the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a bladder of a ram, and tie a reed to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the nature; then blow into the reed forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the nature will return the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's finger is broken, or the woman's, restore it like we have said of the hip bone;
and these nearby fractures are not hidden for those who apply themselves to it and use it, and understand my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right way of restoration: Understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and place the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it three days or until it heals, and it will be quickly healed.
of a fracture with a wound
It is necessary for someone with a fracture and a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that it be healed quickly, so that the healings we have mentioned bear witness to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, and then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no hot abscess comes.
And if a hot abscess comes, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent above the exposed flesh, then it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for placing it equal with your hands, then reset it with this instrument which is of iron, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and slightly thick, so that it does not bend at all when pressed against the limb in your work, and let it be pointed at the front, and thick from the middle to the front, like this:
And it is called "palainche," so that the curved piece must be placed above the head of the exposed bone; and push it at once, so that it returns, and be equal one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, then it is necessary for you to cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, whether a knife or a saw, to the best of your ability;
then remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small pieces of bark.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and properly if it is in a state of; and do not put a plaster or anything else with oil on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then administer poultices once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish healers have done this, and have caused death or ulceration in the patient; and the constriction should be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is large or serious, and you fear that bad things might come, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then poultices should not be put on it; but wrap around, instead of poultices, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming on the wound, remove what you have put on it completely, and apply healing ointment for wounds, such as four-ingredient ointment and similar ones.
And you must untie the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but repeatedly forms pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, therefore you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those detached pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula develops in the area, or another form of corruption, you must treat it according to what he says in his chapter before.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not remove it, for many times death results, but let it rot.
Perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
And if you cannot, leave it.
Many times bruises come after the healing of the break, especially when it is near the joint, and the shape of the limb is a displeasing sight. And perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, watch out if it is fresh. If the administrator gives styptic medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and gum tragacanth, acacia, and similar others, so that you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with abundant egg white or with vinegar; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days; and then unbind it, and begin another one, until the swelling is gone;
or you bind over a piece of lead well made; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has already become hard like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut over it, and remove the superfluous portion; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and delicate afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to a multitude of dressings; or due to too much movement, and not at the proper time; or because it has little blood in its body, and is weak.
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, so that the blood is multiplied within him; and administer baths, and give him joy and ease;
then put ointments on the limb, so that the ointments attract great nourishment, and often moisten it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural shape.
of limb twisted after the sickness When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the bone is broken and visible, and the limb's shape is ugly, nonetheless it does not entirely lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb again, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and torments are fresh, then they should be soaked in hot water, or softening herbs should be cooked, such as leaves of mallow, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or linseed oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take ripe figs, and grind them with fine flax, and similar medicines that soften the swelling.
And sometimes the swelling is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And movement should be given to the limb every hour.
And if the deformity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incision; and apply dressings and care to the healing.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, preventing movement, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately returned to place without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen: Many times it causes swelling and other pains;
However, when this happens, let the patient be bled, then leave it, until the abscess is calmed;
Then warm the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it returns to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jawbones are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two types: where they are slightly separated from their place, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva flows from the mouth that he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and wraps his tongue with his speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns through various methods.
And if it is complete and fully dislocated, you must reset it promptly, and not delay.
and in such a manner that the attendant holds the patient's head, and places the tips of one of their hands at the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two sides; and the other finger of the hand should be further out, to hold it steady.
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw and move it in all directions. And the attendant holds it steady until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it is both jaws together, then soften them with hot water and oil, until you gently reposition them.
Do not delay the repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are properly repositioned, and the patient's mouth closes well without discomfort, then apply damp cloths, in a poultice made of rose oil and wax, then gently bind it with soft bandages.
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two cushions, so that they do not move it to either right or left, nor make any effort to open their mouth, but eat soft food, until the pains are gone and the jaws are healed.
and afterwards, let them eat whatever they wish, but do not strain to open their mouth when eating or drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place at one time, and are not properly returned to their positions, then fevers and harmful customs result, and perhaps diarrhea, and perhaps a vomiting of pure phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is destruction. and many times he dies within four days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the ribs and from the breast, and is sometimes dislocated in the front, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on his back and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then place the plaster and the bandage on it, and bind it tight;
and the shoulder towards the rib cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates any time, reset it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way, the shoulder is reset when it is dislocated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in only three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and perhaps dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind due to the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inside due to the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downward towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it jumps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps some men experience a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is pulled downwards towards the armpit, and a difference is noted between the sick and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow on the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their face, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching it;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if a child is ill.
And the method is that the physician lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places their hands under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcefully upwards to its place; and the physician lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it beneath; Thus it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and the physician shall administer a softening and soothing treatment, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be laid on their back, and a piece of equal thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, of wool should be placed beneath the armpit; then place the patient's heel on the wool, and lift the shoulder head vigorously, and pull the patient's arm;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downward; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish to see it reset in this manner:
and it is necessary that you have a person present who is taller than the patient; and stand directly beside the patient, and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upward, so that the patient hangs down by the arm; and another attendant pulls the patient's hand downward toward the stomach. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reset in another way:
and there is a long piece of wood put in the ground, whose length is similar to a shaft, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but that he has soft cloths above, and the patient lies along the length of the stick;
then his hand is extended downwards on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick of two arms long and four fingers wide, that has a rounded head for it to enter deep under the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the stick, so that the stick does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm on a wide step of a ladder, and let the hands be extended downwards, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint returns into place now.
And when it is in place, whatever the manner, you must place a layer of equal wool under the armpit, then apply a prepared poultice of powdered millstone, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then wrap it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the poultice, and bind the hand to its neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly.
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it. and if it is firm and it is not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint has moved from its place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three places, as it is described earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations towards the breast, or behind, are caused by impact, and stretching of the hands, and another bandage is applied.
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing, there is stiffness in the limb, and delay in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until the stiffness is relieved, and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated in fits and starts, and returns in fits and starts;
and it has dislocated from all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not properly set, because it is clearly seen and felt; and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is twisted, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before suppurating boils appear, for if suppurating boils appear, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms be outstretched, and the hands of the mirror (according to the instrument) around, above and below, and bring the joint to his shoulder together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pressing on the root of the palm with the instrument which is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it, two ministers, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the physician places the joint in his hand, then anoint it with oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, then place a dry plaster with a bit of egg, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm on the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not settle well, then reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly placed; then unbind it.
And if he feels tightness after the joint is reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it well, and press until it is soothed; or you put on the joint a fat sheep's fleece, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when it sweats, then rub the joint gently, then replace the fleece, and then put it in the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow's hay with butter, and bind it on;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than the other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot abscess forms there.
And the returning is done by placing the affected hand on a table, and the attendant stretches the hand out and makes it straight, so that he puts his palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you check if it is correctly in place; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the stretching and returning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, then the patient should put the back of their hand on the table, and the attendant places their hand over that appearance of the joint.
If it returns now, that is good. If not, apply soothing poultices to the abscesses and leave it like that without trying again.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put the joint back in place after a few days, then the joint remains twisted.
and it does no harm to the patient other than that the hand is softened and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerve or artery is cut.
there is no other remedy but to cauterize nearby the place, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, put the plaster we spoke of on it, then bandage it and leave it for 5 days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, then soak it in hot water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the finger of the hand is dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly (palm side).
Then straighten the finger, and push the dislocation with your hand until it returns, then support the head of the finger and lean it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it back in place that same day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and move it, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the palm side of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
and do likewise when it is dislocated on the other side.
Regarding dislocation of the shin from the back.
When the shin from the back or from the neck is dislocated, or if there are multiple dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly comes to the patient.
And the signs are that the urine escapes involuntarily, and cannot be held, and many times certain limbs, or both thighs or both arms or one, become weak.
And many times the shin moves in four directions;
The one that moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you observe if the gilbositez came from childhood: If it has not, there is no cure or healing at all.
And the one that comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the ancient healers described cures with great words, but there is not always great profit in them;
But I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbosite that comes to the breast in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also the one that comes directly on the two sides, and one cannot cure except the one that comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched out on his face in one equal place, and have something firm beneath him so that he does not injure himself;
then place one stick in the ground firmly at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two attendants should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two sticks;
and be firmly held, the sticks as we have said, and the master should place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the master place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a hand-turned winch. And you should fix two sticks at the head of the patient's arm, and two others towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each stick, above and below;
and have one hole in each stick, through which the winch turns, and let the sticks be firmly planted in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two sticks have one turning stick, upon which the ropes turn, and have two small sticks on two turning parts, a palm's width long, to turn the winch;
and then tie the rope that is among the pulleys to the winch towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the ministers turns their winch for the entire rope, and the master straightens the spine as we have said.
And when it is straight, apply a desiccated plaster with plenty of egg, then bandages, then a splint from a tablet three fingers long, that encompasses the area of the protuberance and the healthy part of the spine, then tie it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should use light nourishment until he is healed;
And if any problem arises at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, along with the splint we have mentioned before; And sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance occurs in the posterior vertebra of the back, and one thinks it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that protrudes, for which reason one should not have any presumption; perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations come forth, and not as at other joints;
and the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and front and back;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated front and back.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is such that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee is more apparent than the healthy one, and the diseased person cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes to the outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of that which happens in front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; However, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on the heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind are that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The resetting of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure; and there is no need for him to have presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other cure is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand above in such a way that they put their hands under their armpits, then tightens it with a soft strap over the thigh; and another holds the head of the strap;
and all pull upwards and downwards at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and hangs suspended.
This manner of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its similar case.
When the dislocation is inside, you should place the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh, and the place under the armpit, then extend the strap upwards towards the armpit, and towards the collarbone;
then take other assistants by their arms, and embrace the large part of the injured thigh, and extend it outwards forcefully: then it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is less severe than the others.
And if you cannot straighten it in this way that we have said, then you should tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft strap around the two heels and the two knees, and let the injured leg be extended two inches more than the other;
then be hung over the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then instruct one assistant to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who grasps firmly the thigh, for the joint will return quickly now.
And when the dislocation is in the outer part, the patient should lie down, as we have said for those with gibbosity, and tighten a bandage around the injured leg properly and also around the foot;
then place two embers, one at the head and one at the feet, then place one ember between the patient's thighs in the middle of the shape; and have wet cloths placed around it so it does not injure the patient, then let each assistant pull towards himself, and the most skilled one should put the dislocation even with his hand.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said for gibbosity, and let the patient lie on their healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the skilled one put his effort on the affected arm, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor to lift him from the ground, but it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said concerning lying on both hips; and let him lie on his face, and the bandage be extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint against the table; and it will be fixed when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let it move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you order the patient to bend their leg to their thigh, and if it does not fit into their thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and place their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another attendant should extend their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that their leg fits well against their thigh easily;
and place the plaster on it, and make the leg fit against the thigh, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind them;
and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not fully recovered, the attendant should apply strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healthy.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes dislocated completely, both inward and outward.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and protruding towards the side where it is dislocated.
The reduction is gentle, and it should be gently stretched with the hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and two assistants hold the leg firmly above the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to your left hand twice, then stretch it upwards, and place the foot firmly upward.
And do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, then start the work again, for it returns.
And if it cannot return thus, have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly plant a pole in the ground between their thighs, and tie straps around it, so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let the attendants hold the thigh, and other attendants stretch the foot to their hands or a rope, that they tie above the ankle of the foot. Then let each attendant stretch equally, and the pole should be between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when stretching.
Then let the physician hold the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves above the ankle behind, that the bandages are not too tight.
Then leave it two or three days, and if the bandages soften, tighten them.
Then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days. And if he walks before that time, there is no guarantee that it will not dislocate again.
And if a boil develops there, you must relieve it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently straightened without force, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or, i.e., a table, completely straight, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
And when it is aligned, and nothing is visible, you must place a board under the sole of the foot, between two supports, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and allow it to rest until it is healed.
of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wishes to restore it, many times the patient dies.
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not skilled in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and cautious, not rash;
and use soothing things at the beginning of a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands if you do not see hope of health; and when you see hope, then reposition the limb to its place before the hot abscess reaches it;
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things to the hot abscess and treat the wound, as appropriate, with drying ointments;
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
And beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be measured according to your Creator, and for the well-being of your soul and body.
