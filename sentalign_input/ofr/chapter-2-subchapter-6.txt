On the blockage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an insect, or mineral stone or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as oats, beans, peas; or flowing things like water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then use extraction; and make him sneeze with condiments, and block his nostrils when the sneeze comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upwards.
Often it comes out by this treatment; and if it does not come out, then use extraction with fine tweezers, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with the tweezers, that is good; if not, then use extraction with a fine hook with a small bend; and if it does not come out by this, then make a tube of brass and push the end of the tube into the opening of the ear firmly, and block what is around the tube with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for often it comes out as we have said; and if it does not come out in this way, then take birdlime, and put some on the tip of an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull it out. 
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, then hasten to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasm; and the manner of the cutting is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision in the base of the ear at the fat or the adjacent area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly with your mouth; and treat it until he is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin spatula according to this form:
and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with fine tweezers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is complete.
In the case of water that falls into the ear, the patient should use sneezing powders first, and plug the ear with old cotton.
And lie on the same ear where the water is.
If it comes out by this, that is good.
If not, take many stones the length of your finger, smooth and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on one foot from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not stop doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all comes out; and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and set fire to the other end until most of the reed is burned; then do the same with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the creature, if it is small-bodied, like a flea or similar thing, treat it as we have said in the section; but if it is large-bodied so that it can be felt, then use forceps for extraction; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms generated in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the section and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment is not effective, you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if you see any worms, pull them out with fine forceps, and if they are not visible, take the cannula, of which this is the form:
And it should be narrow below and wide above.
And put the narrowest end in the ear according to the degree of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly with the cannula; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not come out, pack cotton around the cannula as I have described for stones; and if they still do not jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations; and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form, as you see:
And it should be of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling; and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made brass instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a razor and wrap cotton suitably around the point; then drop your oil or juice, and what you want of your medicines into the cannula, and the cannula should be in the ear; then insert the razor with the cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the cavity of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and the distillation should be slightly warmed by fire before being distilled into the ear; and make sure it is not too cold, because the medicine would not be as effective.
