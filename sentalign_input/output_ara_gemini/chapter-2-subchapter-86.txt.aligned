Chapter eighty-six on the treatment of colds and fistulas.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX. On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.	0.8264874
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly suppurates without ceasing, is called in general, in any organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it zakam.	You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.	0.86544836
And the fistula is in reality a hard, white, solidified knot without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather, and therefore some have called it a feather.	The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.	0.7701525
And it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be abundant or little, thick or thin.	At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.	0.85597897
And I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the section, and it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistula and zakam, which is by way of manual work.	I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments. Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.	0.80067444
Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, and among them are fistulas that end in large veins and arteries, or in a nerve, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestines, or in the bladder, or in a rib, or in a vertebra of the back, or in a joint of the complex joints, such as the hand and foot, and among them are those that lead to the vicinity of a vital organ, and so on.	You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.	0.8673173
So whatever of these fistulas are of this description, they are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance.	Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain.	0.76110727
So if there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I have mentioned, and you hope and desire to treat them, and you want to arrive at the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula passes straight, and explore it with it.	But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.	0.87463737
But if there is a curvature in the fistula, then explore it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body, so it slips in easily and bends towards the curvature.	But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.	0.8381158
So if you have ascertained all of that with certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you look, and if the fistula is apparent and near, or in a healthy place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what I have previously described, and extract what is in it of solidified matter, corrupted flesh, excess flesh, and what grows in its opening of flesh, or wart, and so on, and treat it until it heals.	When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you. Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.	0.8576774
But if the fistula is deep-bottomed and straight, then you should incise it in depth as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh, then use threads soaked in sharp medicines and insert them into the bottom of the fistula that you reach with the iron.	If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.	0.79943144
Do that to it several times until that sharp medicine eats away all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption, then treat it with ointments that grow healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what has been previously described.	Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula. Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals. But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way.	0.8687537
And if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and that is confirmed to you, then examine it and incise it as I have told you, unless you are prevented by an obstacle of a vein or nerve or vital organ, as we have said.	If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said.	0.86647075
And if the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals.	And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed.	0.8648617
And if it does not heal and suppurates as it used to do, then know that you have not reached all of the eradication of the corruption, so expose all of it again, and complete its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.	If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely. Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it.	0.7973516
If you can't extract the bones at your time, then apply to the wound what putrefies it, and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. Keep the wound from healing, the incision that you made during your work. Rather, put on it, if you fear that, cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in the Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments putrefy and the bones become bare, it will be easy to extract and pull them.	If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones. Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments. Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.	0.94302213
And if it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what is corrupted of it is only its surface, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption are gone, then dress the wound.	If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound.	0.9250257
But if what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.	If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.	0.75500214
And I will tell you about a zakam that occurred to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and an aid in your treatment.	Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.	0.8527067
And this repetition in his operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his low tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he used to have at all times, from excessive vomiting, a bad faint. So he recovered completely, and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and he was not afflicted in walking with any harm that would harm him at all.	But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain. But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored. He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.	0.86556417
And the sawing should be a little above the place of the corruption, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone, so it does not appear on its surface to the senses, and you are forced to saw it again.	The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.	0.66819715
And if the bone is corrupted and not protruding, but connected to each other, and the corruption is in its middle or in some of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the wood from below, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is, and when you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little away from the corruption, as we have said.	If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is. When you have finished this, saw it from the other side. The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said.	0.80526567
And if the corruption is in a joint, you cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.	If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.	0.58277726
And if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no solution but scraping.	If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping.	0.686933
And if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, then the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and cleanse it in any way you can, and by any trick that is right for you, as long as you are not obstructed by a vein or nerve.	If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.	0.7652556
And know that the cutters and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their erection, their thickness and thinness, their largeness and smallness, their hardness and porosity, therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work a tool similar to that work.	Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.	0.84388983
And know that the works themselves may guide you to the type of tool that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various types of diseases may deduce for himself similar tools for each disease. And I have illustrated for you at the end of this chapter several tools that you may take as examples to follow and as a measure to compare with others, God willing. Image of a saw:	You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease. At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing: Saw.	0.926967

The head of this probe is shaped like the head of a nail, rounded. And its engraving is like the engraving of the scalpel.	Scraper; the head of this scraper should resemble the head of a nail, stellate, engraved like a file.	0.7224401
It is only suitable for scraping the heads of joints if they are corrupted or a large, wide bone.	What it is suitable for is to scrape the diseased heads of joints, or big broad bones.	0.8397208
