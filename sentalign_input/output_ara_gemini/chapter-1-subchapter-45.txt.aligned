Chapter forty-five on cauterizing hernias.	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE. On the cauterization of hernia.	0.8373659
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and omentum descend to the testicle, and this is recent and new, then you should order the patient to abstain from food for the day and that he use laxatives that will bring down the stool from his belly.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and part of the intestine and omentum comes down into the scrotum, being the onset of the disease, forbid the patient to take food for one day and have him use laxatives to empty the bowel.	0.7651622
Then he should lie down on his back in front of you and you order him to hold his breath until the omentum or intestines protrude. Then you push it back with your finger.	Then let him lie on his back in front of you and bid him hold his breath till the intestine or omentum comes out; then put it back with your finger.	0.93894625
Then you mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.	Then, below the hernia over the pubic bone, mark a semicircle whose extremities point upward.	0.82756305
Then you heat a cautery, its shape being this:	Then heat a cautery of this type.	0.61843914
Until it becomes white and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity. Then an assistant places his hand on the area so that the intestine does not protrude.	When it is white hot and emits sparks then return the intestine or omentum into his abdominal cavity, and have an assistant put his hand over the place to prevent the exit of the intestine.	0.7850353
And the patient's legs have been spread apart, and a pillow has been placed under him. And another assistant holds his legs, and another on his chest holds his hands.	You should first have parted his legs and put a pillow under him; let another assistant sit on his legs and another on his chest, holding his hands.	0.7597389
Then apply the cautery iron to the mark itself. And your hand holding the cautery iron should be steady and straight, and you hold it until it reaches the bone. Or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.	Then apply the cautery to the mark, keeping the cautery upright, and hold it till it reaches the bone; or apply the cautery again a second time if it does not reach the bone the first time.	0.85600185
And be very careful of the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, so that you do not burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great affliction.	You must take the greatest care that the intestine does not come out while you are cauterizing, lest you burn it and it result in death or grave injury to the patient.	0.846668
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.	You must understand that if you do not bring the cauterization down to the bone your operation will not be successful.	0.71490973
And the cautery iron for children should be gentle, according to their size, and for adults according to their size.	For boys the cautery should be slender according to their proportions, and for adults according to theirs.	0.81375116
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with ghee until the char of the fire disappears.	Then dress the site of the cauterization till it heals. After three days, treat the site of cauterization with butter until the eschar from the burn departs.	0.8406774
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.	Then treat with the usual ointments till healed.	0.7769191
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.	The patient should lie on his back for forty days so that the wound may cicatrize.	0.8533219
And it is necessary to make his food, for the duration of his treatment, something that softens his stomach so that the intestine does not protrude during straining and defecation.	Throughout the course of his treatment you must make his diet such as will be gentle with his inside, so that the intestine should not come down during the effort of defaecation.	0.75622785
Then, if he wants to get up after the forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.	Then when he wants to get up after the forty days, employ a tight bandage and keep this on another forty days.	0.97347367
And reduce exertion, and fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.	He should be moderate in his exertion, his eating, drinking, and shouting.	0.5315455
For if he follows this regimen in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing.	Thus under these rules he will be completely cured.	0.6552385
And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.	I shall speak of the treatment of rupture by scission in the appropriate chapter.	0.6733704
As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you want it not to increase, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size. And let what you burn of the skin be like two-thirds of it. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing.	When a rupture occurs elsewhere in the belly and is at its inception and you wish it not to grow, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery in proportion to its size; burn about two-thirds through the thickness of the skin and treat as we have said; he will be cured and the rupture will not grow.	0.83248645
And some of the predecessors have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this manner:	One of the Ancients said that ruptures were to be cauterized with a three-armed cautery like this.	0.54327035
After you have marked the hernia with ink, and make the horizontal line on the upper side of the hernia and the other line below, and you apply your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cautery,	First mark the rupture with ink; put the transverse line on the upper margin of the rupture and the other towards the lower, and apply a single claviform cautery in the middle.	0.74900496
and the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.	But the first cauterization is easier and better.	0.7224139
