The two jaws are dislocated if they do not close properly; and the dislocation of both is caused in one of two ways: either they are slightly out of place and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated and entirely out of place, causing looseness at the joint, making the patient's saliva flow uncontrollably and preventing them from closing their mouth, and their speech is affected.	It is rare indeed for the jawbones to be dislocated. Their dislocation may be in one of two ways: either they may shift slightly from their place and be a little relaxed; or they may be completely and utterly dislocated so as to be relaxed down toward the breast so that the patient's saliva runs out and he cannot control it; nor is he able to close his mouth, and he stutters in speaking.	0.8438631
But when the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place by itself with minimal cause.	If it be only a slight displacement it will go back in most cases spontaneously without much trouble.	0.67239773
But if the dislocation is complete and entire, then the reduction must be performed gently and without delay.	But if the dislocation be complete and total it is necessary to set about the reduction of it at once without any delay.	0.8892067
The procedure involves the assistant holding the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the dislocated side of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side; or inserts both thumbs together if both sides are dislocated, with the other fingers outside to grip; and instructs the patient to relax their jaw and move it from side to side; the physician then aligns the jaw and pushes it back into place.	This is done thus: an assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor introduces into his mouth the thumb of one hand at the root of the jaw, if it be a dislocation on one side, or both thumbs if it be a bilateral dislocation, with the rest of the fingers outside to keep it straight. Then let him bid the patient relax his jaws and allow them to move in any direction; while the doctor sets the dislocation, thrusting the jaw until it return to its proper place.	0.9249361
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply steam with warm water and oil, making the reduction easier, and do not delay in reducing both as previously mentioned.	If the reduction be difficult, especially if it be a bilateral dislocation, administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both sides may be facilitated. And on no account delay the reduction, as we have said.	0.8836644
Once they are returned and aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not loosened, then place on them cloth dusted with a plaster made of wax and rose oil; and gently bind it with soft bandages.	When the reduction and straightening have been done and the patient's mouth closes and is not relaxed, then apply to both sides dressings steeped in wax prepared from wax and oil of roses. Then bind it up gently, with a loose bandage.	0.8215847
The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so it doesn't turn to the right or left; do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be liquid until the pain subsides and the jaws are set, then they can chew what they want.	The patient should sleep lying on his back with his head held between two pillows so that he does not move it either to right or to left; nor should he burden himself with chewing but should be on a diet of broth of corn starch until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm; then he may eat whatever he wishes.	0.8930571
This should be managed with ease, and do not stress the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.	Let him use it gently; let him not work his mouth heavily in eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is firmly knit and healed.	0.7596948
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when dislocated and they are not returned to their place, then often this causes fever and persistent sweating, and soon the patient's stomach becomes upset, and they frequently vomit pure bile.	If the reduction of both sides is hard when it is a simultaneous bilateral dislocation, and there is no return to the proper position, then thereby in many cases fevers and perpetual headaches occur; sometimes the patient's belly is loosened and he vomits actual bile.	0.8344996
When you see this, know that it is a bad sign; and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.	When you see this you will know that he is doomed; in most cases in which this happens death follows in ten days.	0.8033714
