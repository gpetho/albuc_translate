Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the latest of my scientific works on medicine with the addition of this one, and has been completed in this way by the exposition of its contents and the declarations which are found in it, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the art of surgery, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is a new art in our time and at a remote period: until perhaps its science has perished and its trace has been erased: nothing remains of it except for slight descriptions in the ancient books, which have been altered by the hand: and thereby there has arisen error and hesitation, until its intentions have been closed and its scope extended: It seemed to me that I should bring together in this treatise, according to order, its positions and declarations, and its brevity: and that I should explain the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the art, together with their addition and preparation which is necessary
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, it is not possible to find a good artisan of this art with his hand in our time: because the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has narrated, until he knows the movements of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and lacerations, and the number of these things, and their emergence, and the pulsation of veins, and quietness, and the exit of places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said, that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, and especially in the art of the hand
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will thereby harm men. As for me, I have seen many who have learned of this science without study or experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Since I have seen a stupid doctor attempt to remove a swelling from a woman's neck by cutting her arteries, and she died between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another doctor who attempted to extract a stone from a patient's bladder, though the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He did this with the result that he extracted the stone along with the bladder itself
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	And the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would certainly die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another doctor who was paid by a certain Duke of our land for his medical skill: and it happened to a black slave who was with him, that he fractured his leg near his heel: and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and strong stitching, and did not allow the wound to drain.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	And as a result the slave died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he dismissed him after a few days, and commanded him not to move his ligament: and he remained like that until the swelling of his leg had gone down, and his foot and leg, and as a result he died.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I found him perfectly calm and free from pain
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	And indeed corruption was confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	When the limb has ceased to suffer corruption, it is no longer liable to further damage. That is, because when the cancer is pure and black, it does not require any further support, except in the limb which will tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And thus, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: the one which is associated with health, and the one which carries the peril in various conditions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I am excited in every place in this book concerning the operation in which there is fear and terror
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore you must be cautious and discreet concerning this, and do not make any boasts or empty promises
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive with humility the measure with attention and protection, and the sick with kindness and firmness, and use the better way for healing thanks to God to obtain lasting glory and praise: and banish the grievous anxieties which make you fear, so that there may be no hindrance to your faith and comfort
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For in this world there remains only the glory of God, and the perfume in this life, and finally in the number of your souls.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen indeed has said concerning some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not be afraid of the black bile: do not speak evil of the physician
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have indeed divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	First Chapter.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On section and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar matters: and the whole chapter is arranged in the order of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and similar matters: the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet, and the order of the instruments
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the application of the dressing, and the use of the cautery: and on what complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we speak of any operation, it is necessary to mention the quality of the dressings and instruments: and in what complexions it should be used
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery dressing and its name is a prolonged, subtle, scientific, and secret discourse.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken on this matter, and they have differed among themselves: and indeed little is to be gained from their discourses, fearing the length of the discourse itself
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cautery is useful for all complexions, whether with material or without material: except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexions with material they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some indeed say that the cautery is harmful in these matters.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others have said otherwise, namely that Cauterium is not suitable for wounds caused by heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat. It is unsuitable to heal wounds caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	Others have said the opposite, namely that Cauterium makes an ointment in all wounds caused by heat and dryness, which happen in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and moisten it, to the nature of fire, you find the body of a man chilled.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself have learned from experience that this is true
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is not enough to learn only from this sermon; one must also learn from experience the last exercise of the Cauterium course, and have recognized the diversity of the dispositions of men, and the causes and accidents of their wounds, and their speed
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Except in the cases of the most delicate complexions, there is no fear of them: and especially in the case of cold and moist wounds
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all the physicians agree on this: and they do not hesitate to use Cauterium on them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And behold, the sons of Alexander say that the secret of the treatment of wounds by Cauterium with fire, and the benefit of it over Cauterium with burning medicine is because fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected limb except for a slight burn
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The medicines of burning have an action that extends beyond the part that is cauterized: and perhaps makes it difficult to heal the wound of the limb, and perhaps even causes death.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not cause this [pain], unless it be excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I have learned from experience, on account of the length of my service and study with art, and the position over truth of things: and because of this I am excused from the length of the speech.</start_of_turn>
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And even if it is not permitted for this book of mine, I will declare a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsions, which expels ailments with a philosophical demonstration that agrees with the minds of the learned.</start_of_turn>
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know this, my sons, that they themselves dissent in the time when it is necessary to make a cautery, and they say that it is better to leave it alone.</start_of_turn>
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cautery is useful in all times: for in fact the document [of the ailment] is absorbed by the fat at the time of healing, which is attracted by the cautery.</start_of_turn
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for necessary and strong pains, fasts, which do not tolerate delay: for they fear the fire, which brings about greater harm than the slight damage done by the ailment itself.</start_of_turn
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	Do not let the minds of the learned or the sons think that because of this it is not useful, except for madmen and foolish doctors, for the ailment which is healed by a cautery is not always cured: they take this for consequence, and it is not so: for a cautery is not, except in the case of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries humors which are the causes of the ailments.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Truly, a cautery surpasses medicine by its speed of action, the excellence of its operation, and the certainty of its mastery: and it is possible that the ailment will be cured at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the ailment, and the excellence of the treatment: and that which is prepared in his body from the collection of superfluous humors in it: and that which comes to him from the cause itself, except in the case of an ailment in which a cautery is administered.</start_of_turn>
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Acute pain in a limb with few supernumerary hairs and moisture, like the cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that it will not return in that place because of the pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	However, this is in few cases.</start_of_turn>
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, the saying is correct: the cautery of a tooth is the last remedy in medicine. It is the correct thing to say: because they believe that there is no cure that can be compared with medicine, neither with anything else after the cautery.</start_of_turn>
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the thing is contrary to this, and the intention that the cautery is the last remedy in medicine is not true, except when we administer other modes of treatment for some ailment, and these do not yield: then we administer the cautery at the end, and it yields. It is thus that the cautery is the last remedy, not in accordance with the intention as the vulgar people and the multitude of doctors understand it.</start_of_turn>
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not form pus at the place of the cautery.</start_of_turn
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, this is not absolutely true: for I have seen this to be the case, and I have found that it does not cause this in some bodies without other things.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with the substance itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you burn the cautery with gold in fire, you are not to declare that this is the case when you ignite it according to the quantity you desire, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the substance itself and if you add more fire to it, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into leaves.</start_of_turn
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the artificer depart from that to engage in this occupation? And because of this, Cauterium with iron is used by us more quickly and closer to the operation, from its rectitude to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	I have also set out this Chapter on Cauterium, following the chapters: and I have set them out from the head to the feet: so that they may satisfy anyone who desires something from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Regarding the manner of cauterizing the head in the coronal commissure.
Caput II.	Chapter II
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here is the cauterization is performed with regard to the lord of humidity and frigidity over the brain: which are two causes of swelling, and of the multitude of flows of humors from the head downwards to the eyes and ears, and of the multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of the throat: and generally all ailments which arise from frigidity, such as palsy, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and the like of these ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: immediately when the patient arrives with the disease, along with a physician who uses a soothing solution, the head should be bathed three or four nights, according to the nature of the disease, and the age of the patient, and his custom
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a circle with his hand over his head with the nail.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands which are placed square, so that your hands rest on his chest
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever his middle finger points, that is the place where the cautery is to be applied with the flame
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the Cauterium with Olive Oil: which is like this in shape
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked place with the cautery, descending slowly, so that your hand is gradually constrained, and you withdraw it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then draw your hand quickly and grasp the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that some part of the bone has been broken by the quantity of the head of the ulna, or by the quantity of the herb, then draw your hand again
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, draw your hand again with the iron itself, or with something else which is cold: until you see the bone which I told you of
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something of salt and dissolve it in water, and soak in it the bottom, and put it over the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put over it the soaked bottom in butter, and leave the bandage over the place until the eschar is consumed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents of four herbs, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said that the more the wound is open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more useful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cautery firm, until something of the thickness of an ossificated bone is burned
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then loosen that which has been burned from the bone, and then heal it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that when the cautery is finished it should leave an imprint in the bone like a footprint, so that the bone will be broken: or an instrument which women put inside the small letter: and they say that from this place steam of the head arises, and the wound is opened for a long time
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it cares until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	Then it cares until it is consolidated.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And discharge it; it is better for me that way with the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head weakens from the resolution of its natural continuity: as we have seen in other limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is weak by nature: the first kind of cauterism is the most safe and good for me, and that is what I shall use: for I work with it for the health of the patient.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In this way it is cauterized for the whole pain of the head.
Caput III.	Head Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain: and it persists in the patient, and there is heat, and swelling, and purulent discharge, and oil, and application of things like these
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized once with that which we have mentioned, and nothing more is added to it: then consider it
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the patient is strong in nature and not weak, and there is cold that comes upon it: then cauterize with another cautery under that little one
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over all the corners of the head with the cautery, so that it does not go through the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone from which we have spoken.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it once with the cautery in the nape of the neck in the place which is called the uas: and it is the place where the wind is placed: and raise your hand up in this, and do not uncover the bone
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The patient is relieved because of that cold which comes upon it, and different from the pain of other cauteries of the head in general
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this concerning the Cauterium: it must be that the Cauterium be such that it may cauterize the horns of the head and the back of the head more finely, while it cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>

Caput IIII.	Chapter III.</start_of_turn
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When in the part of the head there is pain and swelling, or if the pain extends up to the eye, and it is driven out with medicinal poultices, and other treatment is administered as I have said in the discourse on diseases, and it does not suffice: then cautery is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with the iron.</start_of_turn
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But as for cautery with acute burning medicine, you take a piece of wood about the size of a barleycorn, and burn it until it is red hot, and then you touch the diseased area with the burnt end.</start_of_turn
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the area of pain at the same time as you perform phlebotomy on the side, until there is a bubble under the skin where the tooth is caught.</start_of_turn
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it into the wound until it reaches the bone: then bind over it with a bandage of moderate constriction, and leave it in place for fifteen hours. Then remove the dressing and give the wound two or three days’ rest. Finally, apply a wet compress over the wound until the pain has gone away.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with some of the burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth tractate on Burning Remedies.</start_of_turn
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Burning of the veins with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Burning with iron is performed in this manner
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called Clavicle because its form is like that of a key, in which there is a slight curvature, and in the middle there is a small protrusion.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the place and hold your hand: and slowly draw the iron away with the amount that has been scorched from the thickness of the skin, like half of it
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand so that the artery below does not burn and the blood flow does not increase
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the area in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days: then place the area with butter: afterwards care with unguent until it has healed
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if necessary, burn the haematoma with the second degree of the cautery iron.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	Burn from the incision of the artery in this haematoma, not directly over it.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	In the old way, cautery was performed by opening the haematoma.
Caput V.	Chapter V
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you have treated the haematoma, when the swelling has subsided from the treatment we mentioned before, and the cure has not taken hold: and if you notice swelling which the first or second cautery with medicine or with fire did not cure, then you must burn the cautery iron with a knife until the sign of pain disappears on the place, which is as long as half of a finger, or like that: and hold your hand firmly until you have pierced the artery, and keep it like that until you reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	It is necessary to check for any possible cause of jaw displacement, which may occur during mastication, to prevent its becoming flattened or its nerve being damaged, from which spasm arises.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	This action must be taken with great caution, and the haemorrhage of the artery must be arrested cautiously.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its division there is fear, especially for him who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not skilled or experienced: and he abandons the operation at once
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood which is accidental to an artery according to its custom, and in its place is found in this book of mine
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If the fever from the illness does not suffice for this Cauterium, and the patient's body tolerates Cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, take care of the wound, until it is healed
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	If you wish, apply Cauterium as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with Cauterium which has two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For Cauterization is better than excision and more effective

When it happens in the Ear that there is pain from cold, and it is cured with poultices, and the rest of the treatment which we have mentioned previously, and the pain is not relieved, then apply Cauterium: and this is called the Punctum, which has this shape
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make the Punctum after you have ignited it around the whole Ear, as it is rolled around: or around both, if there is pain in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And prolong thee with the Cauterio from the root of the ear towards the parumper, after you have marked the place with the encaustro: and let the quantity of the Cauterio be ten points in every aure, and so on.

When you have cured this species of torture with baths, and purging, and gargling, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the diseased three times with the Cauterio: once at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the ear, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</start_of_turn

Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the patient to place his head on your lap, and hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put a soaked sponge in the eye of the sufferer, or in the mucus of his eyelashes over his eye: then apply the Cautery, which is of this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Hold it concave, like the shape of a penknife whose handle is cut off at one end, as the Cautery is: and if it is penetrating too far, or if it is too high, do so with care
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	It is better to do this concave than flat
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then put on the Cautery again, which is now lit cold.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand alongside the Cautery from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not slip or move the patient: and place the Cautery on the fat of the eye and burn it through
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If, therefore, you keep the Cauterium close to the bone from the beginning, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	If not: then repeat the Cauterium once or twice if you find it insufficient: and leave it off for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place the bandage with butter, and care for it with an exicator until it heals

Direct it to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place under the opening of the fistula a thin cushion, that is, a needle of a thin kind, whose form is like this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of lead which is equal to a drachma, liquefied, and keep your hand firm with the needle securely retained, and do not move the patient in any way, so that it does not run or cause the liquefied lead to go into his eye
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to place above the eye of the patient a bandage soaked in albumin or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	The lead will burn away the place of the fistula, and will heal it with a miraculous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	When the fistula is healed, with what we have said of the Cauterium and the care, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not: then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is stated in its own place

When swelling occurs in the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus, and swells up: afterwards it becomes black, and pus comes out, and a fistula is formed: then you must treat it, and do not be deceived by the cure, then you must burn with the cautery according to the quantity that is in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then put the burning fire into the cavity of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron is burnt through to its depth, and its end: do this once, or twice at most

Or if desired, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it upon the painful tooth: and place upon it a burning iron until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery of the same with fire is to be done so that the air canal or the iron tube is opened.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of bulk in the body of the tooth, so that the fire does not penetrate too deeply into the bone of the diseased tooth
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then burn the cautery in the shape that pleases you: and place it upon the cheek of the tooth: and hold your hand firmly until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will vanish, or in the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary to press the cautery into the impression, so that it may fill the diseased bone with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then expel it.

Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	It is also possible to use these needles for cautery with the knife cautery, when there is subtlety and skill in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	Beware lest you go too far with the cautery, and burn the whole skin, for the body is thereby burned throughout, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know well.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Regarding the cautery of the posterior portion of the liver.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.</start_of_turn
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When the exitus [of blood] occurs, and you wish to write, if that [area of] the apostema is in the liver flesh, or in its covering: if it is in the liver flesh, there is dull pain and swelling without sharpness: and if it is in the liver covering, with sharp pain and swelling: know that it fatigues the physician to care for it.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore let the patient lie over his bed.</start_of_turn
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the apostema with the cautery: then ignite the cautery which is absorbed by the heat.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that one cautery until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the spleen, until all the blood is gone: then take care of the care of the bleeding, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	It is not appropriate for anyone to perform such cautery except one who has studied the art of medicine for a long time, and who has experience of these things: for otherwise, you will hear of such an operation.</start_of_turn

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	In the case of cauterization of the pleura.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	They say the ancients, when cauterizing the cold pleura with aristolochia roots, did it in this fashion
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you take some dry aristolochia roots, cut one of them in length equal to the thickness of a finger
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then plunge it into oil and light the thing in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	And with one cautery, under the angle of the collarbone, and with two smaller cauteries under the guidance of little incisions to the part under the beard
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between two ribs: and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between two ribs
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you must not press your hand with the cautery, but rather that it should smell openly from the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients say that there are men who make use of a cautery like a nail of iron: they burn and then put it inside the body between the ribs, until it is expelled along with the thing to which it was applied, and it comes out whole: just as we said concerning the apposition of the liver
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient will die immediately or that a fistula will form in the place of the cautery, which will not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	How to cauterize the spleen of the head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating a spleen ailment, as we have mentioned in the treatise on the treatment of ailments, and the treatment does not confer healing, then cautery is to be used in this [case] according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three or four cauteries in line along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cautery for the liver, which precedes this figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every two cauteries the thickness of a finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cautery be as we have mentioned for the cautery of the liver
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not press your hand with the cautery: let the patient lie recumbent above his back
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cautery is to make the cautery with two handles like that which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is over the spleen directly above the patient's elbow: and raise your arm as high as the patient's body, so that the cautery will fall along the length of the body
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two handles of the cautery which are lit on one side until the fire penetrates the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: four cauteries will be made thus.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery which has three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have finished using it: let it emit pus for several days: for that is more effective than any other method which has preceded it in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	How to cauterize in hydropathy
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter III.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall into Hydropsism, except as the proper ascleptics do.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydropsism with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the preceding discourse, and the treatment does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the ribs between the vertebrae, and one in the middle of the chest, and one in the middle of the abdomen: and the quantity of depth of the cautery should be proportional to the thickness of the skin
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then draw out the cautery slowly, so that pus may be emitted over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the patient from the treatment after the cautery: because it is necessary to combine two intentions with it: and it will quickly recover with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery which is used for the belly is the claw: according as its shape is; and the form which is used for the back is the olive, according as its shape is.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the method of cauterizing feet or limbs, so I am unable to translate that portion of the sentence.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the limbs are apostematized in Hydropsism, and the cavity is filled with lemon juice: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nook, which is between the heel and the toe: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand again: and do not move it at all
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The lemon juice will rise up again, and the cautery should be in the same form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make over two crura two cauteries in every limb, and make the cautery with the extremity of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, about the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteries. And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something from it comes away with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Then make over two crura two cauteries in every limb, and make the cautery with the tip of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, about the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteries. And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something comes away from it with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.
Caput XXXV.	Then make over two crura two cauteries in every limb, and make the cautery with the extremity of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, about the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteries. And draw out the cautery without treatment for a long time: until something comes away from it with some water. Then care for the rest as we have said.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly is in a state of solution from cold and moisture, until the power of retention and digestion is weakened in the stomach and intestines: and this is cured with the methods of treatment, and not by nature. And the broth tolerates the excessive power of the cautery: then make the cautery with a large knife over the belly, as it was before with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, below the ribs, and a cautery under the rib, and a cautery over the fatty tissue above the hips, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if the broth moistens the excess, and the patient tolerates this, then make the cautery with a knife over the loin, and a cautery over every hip: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err.
Caput XXXVI.	There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the rectum, either one or several, and they are from gross, cold, or moist humors, they are cured when treated as we have said above; and no other treatment is required: then cauterize three times with the cautery over the lower part of the spine under the almonds and triangular, and cauterize under the navel as with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is stiff and his food does not digest, and his face is pale and his feces are watery, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, as we have said before: and cauterize over the liver and over the spleen and over the tail, with a closed cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err. When the uterus has been cut, and there are many small blood vessels which are liable to bleed, cauterize over them with a small cautery, without causing damage to the vessel.
Caput XXXVII.	There exists a most effective treatment whose application does not err. When the uterus has been cut, and there are many small blood vessels which are liable to bleed, cauterize over them with a small cautery, without causing damage to the vessel
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut the uterus, then you should apply the cautery which contracts the vessel.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning part of the cautery into the cut uterus: and move your last hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vagina, from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many blood vessels in the uterus, then cauterize each one as we have said before
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for it until it is cured, when that which is given from unguents has been administered.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with great heat over the wound, that is the last resort in treatment.</start_of_turn>

Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the section and the work that we have mentioned in its place, and returns from it, perhaps he will be cured by cautery.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When this happens to any fistula, and it becomes old, pus comes from it, and the tissues are softened.</start_of_turn
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a subtle hook.</start_of_turn
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then learn the depth of it with the hook.</start_of_turn
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply the cautery, which is like a knife.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then enter the burning itself into the fistula and the amount in which the clamp has entered.</start_of_turn
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery above until all the corrupted bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard against overheating the nerve, if there is any, or the great veins: or if the fistula goes to the bladder or the intestines, then guard against those places as well.</start_of_turn
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and remember that it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is cured.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and materials are detached from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	If it is not detached from it by materials, then you know that it is penetrating, or that there is a broken bone beneath the surface, or almost like this: whose memory will come to the place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	In this way, concerning cauterization of the Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the Renes that there is pain from cold or from great swelling, and that it is diminishing because of that which is causing the infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the marrow above the kidneys, with cautery over every kidney along with the nail, the precursor of which is memory
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we must cauterize it also in the very marrow.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	For there will come three lines.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore there will be two last things in the treatment
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	In this way, concerning the cauterization of the Vesica
Caput XL.	Chapter XL
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness in the Vesica due to gravel and humidity until the infirmity does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the Vesica, where the hair of the flanks begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of the cauterization on the side be according to the quantity of the node of the thumb: and cauterize with a lower cautery or with two, if you wish. And let it be according to what precedes the cautery nail
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	In this way, concerning the cauterization of the Matrix
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When in the Matrix cold and moisture abound, and it is forbidden by this [condition] from impregnation, and its menses are corrupted, and its production is delayed, and there is pain added to its companion, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterize over the lower belly skin, or two cauteries: and let the cauteries be blunt.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	In dislocation of the Ancham, cauterize three times around the navel, as we said above.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the heel of the Ancham, and is the cause of its displacement from its place: the sign of this is that one thigh is prolonged over the other, when compared with the thigh on the same side: and the place of dislocation is found in that groove.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is therefore necessary to cauterize the diseased part above the heel of the Ancham with a circle: after you have marked the sign with the cautery around the circumference of the heel, as if you were rolling: and that the heel itself falls in the middle of the circle.</start_of_turn
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form which we mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach.</start_of_turn
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present, then cauterize it three times with a large olive cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin altogether.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	(The text continues with instructions for treating sciatica.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain arises in the ankle bone, and the cause is coldness and moisture: the physician should treat the patient with what has been mentioned previously [in another section], and if no benefit results, he should dry it up: then it is necessary to remove the patient from the thick humours with foul pills or artificial pills, and like these.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cautery in this case is in two ways: either with cautery and astringents, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is done in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is to cauterize over the ankle bone itself with three triangular cautery instruments, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the burn either deep or shallow
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between every two cauteries be of the quantity of the breadth of a finger: and let the cautery be round
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is done in the middle over the ankle bone itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Then there are four cautery instruments
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize in a circular fashion, whose form precedes the cautery of dislocation of the ankle, one: so that it may contain the whole ankle
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the whole thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adherent to the ankle itself, and does not extend up to the knee and thigh
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize the two cautery instruments over the knee, over the place where the patient feels pain there, and cauterize your hand over the heel of the foot to the outer side: and let the cautery be with a knife
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	The depth of the burn should be in accordance with the depth of the hair of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then burn only in that place as much as the burn of a point, a third, or a fourth, or even more, as is necessary for that area.</start_of_turn>
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If it is said that the pain is under the knee and above the ankle, then burn only in that place with a single knife.</start_of_turn>
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And burn always in your cauterizations, that you do not reach the nerves or great vessels, and that you do not cause excessive pain or contraction.</start_of_turn>
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I also know of one who cauterized over the knee and left the last burn until the leg was swollen, until the foot was completely swollen and perforated, and the whole leg was corrupted: then the belly burst open and there was death after that.</start_of_turn>
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts together, burn both of them in this manner.</start_of_turn
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men say concerning the cauterization of an abscess, that this is the manner.</start_of_turn
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a resemblance like iron, whose diameter is a middle of the palm: and let it be at a distance from its orifice equal to the length of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there let there be the third part within.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space between every part of the three that is equal to the quantity of the wrist-knot: and let the burn be open from two parts: and let its height be like a knot, or two knots: and make the handle of the iron centered in the burns.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is ignited in the fire until it turns red, and it throws sparks: then it is placed upon a cushion of felt covering the painful side over the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	It is cauterized with three round cauteries in one vessel
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let it be withdrawn three days later.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterward it is plastered with butter: and let the wound be opened for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, concerning this kind of cautery, of the son of the blacksmith, we use it little, because of its fearsome appearance: and because of this, we find few who are willing to endure it over it
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Indeed, from the good cauteries it is useful to him who suffers, and it is found with him in its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery, however, with the physicians who are accustomed to it, is useful as when you make two holes in the arm of a man who has a wound of the artery of the wrist: from which the bone of the hand comes down, either of iron or of lead, the length of the wall: of which two knots should be made at the height of these.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space between each quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, and there should be an opening below and above: and it should contain itself inside, according to this form
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it upon a cushion of felt covering the painful side over the healthy side
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand over the cushion of felt many times
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire a little, and keep it for the quantity of an hour: and the patient will tolerate the biting of the cautery, and he himself brings it to himself, for he finds the biting to be like fire until it rests.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and bathe the whole area with warm water and sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until the black of the wound has subsided: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow out of it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the last thing to do.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents, until it heals
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the knee: make for it a bath containing as much water as you did in the whole area
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	This is the way of warm water: and I have written it in the treatise on medical rectifications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unburnt lime, mix both in an equal amount: put each of them in a new vessel, whose lower part is pierced with a small hole according to the quantity which is to be included: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with vinegar: and pour over the alkali and lime solution sweet water, which submerges both by a finger: and then press your hand firmly: and leave the vessel until the acute water has descended from the lower part of the treated vessel.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather up the whole water, and pour it over the lime: and leave it, until it recovers
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	These are themselves strong and acute, which are administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of the rest of the limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it makes the operation of fire itself
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the physicians, who cauterize the area, even as for testicles, and mas, and almond oil, and lime with soap, thus that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	Galen also reports that a certain man from ancient times received treatment for pain in the buttocks and sciatica: and he praised his diligence.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He said that no other treatment was required, and that he was healed by one bath alone.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	It is as it is said of the physician: if the patient does not improve with oil, let him be bathed with hot water; and let him be massaged frequently with much fat, and let him be placed upon the buttocks, where the pain is, or the thigh, or the hip: and it shall be bound, and it shall be left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the pain.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then let him be put into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body is softened, put him into the tub.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain will depart, and he will be healed
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you know that no other cauterization should be used with these medicines, except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	Dioscorides also says that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it, gives relief to the sciatica: and it is cauterized in this way.</start_of_turn>
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a lancet be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in the fire, until it is black.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it upon the lancet, and leave it until it is extinguished.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera illud.	Then do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Then do it again until sensation returns above the mediation, and the pain has ceased.

Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When there is pain in the back from numerous causes, or from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or in similar cases, neither cautery nor any other remedy will suffice, except for one kind which is made from the infusion of cold and moist matter.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary, therefore, after evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar substances, to make three lines on the back where the pain is, alongside the palm of the hand, and when signs of scorching appear in every line after having made five cauteries, or more according to the patient's tolerance.</start_of_turn

The sign of its inception in children is: when there is a tightening in the belly at inspiration near elevation, and movement: and it is found in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of the back, which begin to stand out over the rest.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have done that, and you wish to make that, then burn it with the cautery which is circular in shape according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	The cautery shall grasp every part of the bone equally: and if you wish to burn around the bone with the cautery, make two or three points, and let the points be close to one another
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And burn, lest you administer the cautery to a callous person, which is in the spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	In the same way as for cautery of the foot and the joining pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which flow upon every limb of the body, then when such pains happen in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call it Podagra
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore Podagra is cured by the coldness of causes, with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to burn around the joint of the foot after the evacuation with many cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olivewood
Cuius haec est forma.	Which has this form
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you do not wish to make holes on the face of the foot, then make it with the point of the cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	And if the pains ascend up to the knee, or remain in the other joints, and many such things happen, then burn the whole knee with three, or four cauteries, with the same cautery of Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If necessary are more of these for the cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather keep the thickness of the skin at a distance from it.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, pain rises to the knees and back: then manage what we said concerning the cautery in its chapter
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pain is only in the hands: then prick in the circumference of the fingers, as two lines are unrolled
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, the pain remains in the digits: then prick throughout the node of the digit, over every point of the digit, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pain ascends after a day to the elbows or shoulders: then cauterize both of them from all sides
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not aggravate the sick person by harsh methods, but by the advice of doctors.

Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And to evacuate from soft things, so that the stool may descend from its belly
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit between your hands on your back: and command him to hold his breath until he vomits, or until the bladder or intestine appears
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce the finger with your thumb, and sign with the sign of the encaustro below the rupture above the bone of the knee, with the sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of the circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery, which has this shape, until it turns white, and then remove the cautery.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or the bladder to their own cavity
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then place your hand on the place, so that the intestine does not escape: and you have opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed under it powder, and another servant on his ribs and another on his chest which holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on that sign, your hand with the cautery standing straight up
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it there, until you follow the bone: or do it again with it another way, if you have not followed it with it from the beginning until the bone
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And observe prudently the exit of the intestine in the hour of your cautery, so that you do not burn it, and that it comes out through that over the patient or the wound, or great malice.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not follow with the cautery the bone, your operation will be in vain
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery be fine for infants, according to their measure

Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound has healed
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you give the patient nourishment throughout the time of his cure, so that it softens his belly: so that the intestine does not escape through the wound and be evacuated
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, he must manage the ligament which is made central and keep it for forty days more.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	He will abstain from labor, and take nourishment of food and drink, and use of strong medicines.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he will be restored to complete health.

When however ruptures happen in the remaining part within, and are just beginning, and you wish that they should not grow larger, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be so that from that time forward it will endure as much as a third of it
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said: and do not add to it
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some say that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	When it is signed with encasement, and a line is drawn through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and a line to the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery handle.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.

When anything has happened to any limb by swelling or percussion and the pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with physicians: then it is necessary to cauterize with the Puncti cautery

And especially those kinds of leprosy which are caused by the corruption of phlegmas and melancholia: in such cases one must carefully consider the very act of cautery.</start_of_turn
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the leprosy is not severe, and the swelling has gone down as we have mentioned previously, and has not reappeared: and the time has come for the patient, who has suffered corruption throughout his body: then burn him five times with the cautery: one in the middle of the head, one below at the front near the hair's end, and two on the two horns, and one at the back on the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, touch his hand with the cautery lightly, until you make an imprint in the bone, and the cortex is fractured: so that the great vapors will be driven out from it, and burn the spleen also with the cautery, as we have said before.</start_of_turn
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If however the leprosy has spread throughout the body and is obvious: then burn with these cauteries which we have mentioned in the head, and cauterize the tip of the nose, and two on the two cheeks, and two on the two cheekbones, and six on the vertebrae of the neck, and one large one on the flanks of the buttocks and one above the kidneys: and two on the buttocks: that is one on each buttock, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the biceps, and two on the triceps, and two on the chest, and cauterize the whole of the joints between the fingers and toes, and the heels of the feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And take care that from the nerves which are above the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	When the cautery is applied above the heel, and also above the ribs, and also above the spleen.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add of the cautery, the more damage is done, and the more likely it is to cause harm
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sickly man does not feel pain from the cautery, just as the healthy do: because the body of the sickly man is already stunned
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	It is necessary that the cautery should be of appropriate size, and in proportion to the members and the joints: according to what preceded from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cautery with an herb paste with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until the wound is healed

When some limb is stiff and cannot be cured by physicians, and oils, and poultices, and it does not heal, then cauterize the stiff limb with cautery, according to the size of the limb or its proportion
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let the cautery not penetrate too deeply into the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with an unguent, until it is healed
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	When the cautery is applied to some stiffness of the hand or foot, in the joints of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: then the stiffness will be removed
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not be rash over this, except for one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	How to cauterize in Albaras.
Caput LI.	How to cauterize in Albaras.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras has hardened, and no remedy from medical knowledge can be found: then cauterize over the cauterium itself deeply but sparingly, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white is removed, and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with barley flour and lentils with oil of rose, and arnica leaves, and poppyseed, and hyacinth blood: take a part of each: mix them together, and spread over the wound, and adhere to the place, until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	How to cauterize in Cancer
Caput LII.	How to cauterize in Cancer
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with the cauterium in a circle around its circumference, as it returns
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise men say, that one should cauterize in the middle last of all.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I do see it often.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteriums.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	How to cauterize in Adubelati
Caput LIII.	How to cauterize in Adubelati
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturity, or because of excess fat making it fat, or because of age which makes it frail, or because of weakness, or because of time, and he wishes to hasten the maturity of the Adubelati: then cauterize around it with many small cauteriums puncturing
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then depart from it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	Then depart from it. For itself will hasten with maturity.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be away from that which follows the diseased, in order to diminish the course of the pus.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	In a corroding wound, cauterize cautiously
Caput LIIII.	Day 42.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A wound is not corrosive except for corruption in a mobile limb, and it corrupts it: like fire consumes dry wood
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you wish to cauterize the corrosive in a place where it tolerates it with fire, then ignite the cautery frequently, make the blisters small and large, according as it will be convenient in the place where it is corrosive
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it except for the very little
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put upon the cauterized place powdered sulphur with oil, until all the scabs are eradicated and the whole corruption is gone
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with nourishing poultices of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days new flesh is born healthy, in which there is no corruption, it is good
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over that which remains of the corrupted places
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	A wound is treated with acute medicine when necessary
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself arises from the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, it arises from the place of the cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	For indeed, the cautery is of quicker healing when applied to ulcers and boils.
Caput LV.	It is of quicker healing when applied to ulcers and boils
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a great, swelling, painful thing that affects the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the cautery is of two kinds: with fire and with hot water
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	When the cautery is done with fire, it is like branding a goose feather: this is done with iron according to the amount that it contains in the limb from every side: and it must not touch the edges
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put the fire on the limb.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then withdraw the limb with the cautery around the limb until the cautery reaches the depth of the limb: and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with coarse sand, sprinkle with salt: and leave the dressing on it overnight
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	And it will itself disappear from its root
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place where the flesh has been burnt, until it has healed
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not cauterized, and appear many times on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer the cautery with hot water: and take a piece of iron, or a piece of wood, or a feather from a bird: and put it on the limb, or on the ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula: hold your hand steady and withdraw the cannula with pressure on your hand near the root of the claw, so that the mark of the cannula may be impressed on the root of the claw. Then find the hot water up to the root of the claw: and the patient should expect relief after an hour of the hot water treatment.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then withdraw it, for the claw is eradicated with its roots.</start_of_turn>
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so with one hand after the other, until you reach above all that is in the body.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for the wound after it has been eradicated, with what is generated from the split flesh.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In Tremore, cauterize in this way.</start_of_turn
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary to cauterize four times, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in the chest cauterize, and on the stomach cauterize.</start_of_turn
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor will cease with the cauterization of olive oil, and health will quickly return from the cold sickness.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Thus cauterize Albathir.</start_of_turn
Caput LVII.	Chapter 67.</start_of_turn
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are expelled from the body of Albathir wounds, that is, abscesses, which are formed from corrupted thick matter.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore in the first place when they appear to cauterize over every head of the abscess with a fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is kindled with fire.</start_of_turn
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	As with the root of aristolochia longae.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or as with the cautery of a lentil
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes when cauterizing the blood clots, at the beginning of their expulsion, they do so in this way: and do not grow: and rupture the superfluity that makes them, and heal from within.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with a bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	As to the cautery in the flow of blood from an artery to the wound
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many things happen with the flow of blood from an artery that has been incised at the wound, which happens both outside and at the incision of the apostem, or by the cautery of a limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to stop the bleeding
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone, then act promptly with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place above it your finger index: and tighten it much, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not escape from there again
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in the fire a small olive cautery, and many in number: and blow over them, until they are ignited thoroughly
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then grasp from the thing one, or a little, or a lot, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery upon that very place: and when you have moved your finger away quickly: and hold the cautery, until the bleeding is stopped
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it is expelled when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then grasp another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to perform it until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Do not burn the nerve that is there, and add over the sick some other malice.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	Know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to sever it: especially when the artery is great, except with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted, and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or there are placed over it medicines of the property of severing blood, and it is bound with a nail of constriction of descent
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs the severance with a ligature, and tightens with a bandage or position of the burning things, or the like, does not give it sufficient pain, except rarely
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however it is done to someone, and there is no physician present, neither medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the orifice of the vein itself, as we have said, and its constriction above, until the blood is overcome from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not moved, except with cold water or ice always, until the blood is congealed, and has become firm, and is severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider what is needed from the cautery, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Procedures.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter that all diseases in which fire and burning medicine concur, and their occasions, their causes, and their instruments, and the forms of cautery
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I shall treat of the chapters following from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	I shall pursue this chapter in the same way: as one who seeks an answer to his inquiry
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin, it is necessary to tell you what is omitted from this chapter in comparison with the first chapter on cautery
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore it is necessary to exercise caution in this operation, because in this chapter there falls out evacuation with blood in many places: in the opening of the vein, or the incision over the bone, or the opening of an abscess, or the care of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and such like things. From all of these things there is associated tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them blood
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you, do not be afraid of this, for in this art there are many people who have become skilled as men in health have become skilled in sickness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from this is he who flees from his ailment, and is light in the face of danger: because of his gentleness which he has from his ailment and the length of his experience
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when an ailment comes from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	From him also is the one who gives you his staff, and tells you that he is with you, hoping for your health, and his ailment is mischievous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not proper that you consent to those who come to you from outside, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	You should be cautious with them, more so than with love and your own possessions.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume anything about them, except after certain knowledge has been revealed to you, which confirms that their actions are worthy of praise
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	Use your care in treating all female patients, in prognostication and indication of the thing which is conducive to their health
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies your help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, his son, your intellect, and do not take from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I, too, have ordained this chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according as it follows the chapter of Cauteries, from the navel until the feet: that you may fulfill your desire and what you need from this.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this ailment often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens for an occult cause which is not known
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	I have not seen this illness in anyone except children: and for all those whom I have seen among them, death has been the consequence: for this reason it is fitting for me to send away the operation in this case
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have also seen among children whose heads were filled with water, and their heads would swell up every day, until they were unable to sit on their own because of the size of their heads: and the moisture increased until they died
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And thus also is moisture, either collected between skin and bone: or collected under bone upon the fat.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And in that case, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the swelling is slight, one must make a single incision in the middle of the head, about the length of two knots, until the moisture is drained.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the shape of a sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If there is much moisture and the swelling is great, then one must make two incisions according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the edges of the head are open from every side: and water is driven out when you press your hand into the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then one must make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner.</start_of_turn
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision drain out all the moisture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then stitch up the incisions with silk and wool.</start_of_turn
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then bandage it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and care.</start_of_turn
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not tighten the head too tightly.</start_of_turn
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the patient little food and much dry food until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider the size of the swelling and the collection of water.</start_of_turn
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes in the skull there is more, or in the eyebrow, or on the right, or on the left.</start_of_turn
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Rise therefore when the incision is made where the swelling appears and the water is poured in: and cut that according to what is possible.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	Observe, lest you cut an artery, and the blood flow increase, and the patient die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling comes about in the eyes or the chest, and the disease persists, and no remedy is of avail: then the last remedy is the incision of these two arteries
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to make an incision, that you remove the patient's head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the place with rough cloth, so that the arteries appear
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then bind the patient's neck with anything he has of his own cloth
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse of the vein lies
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both are located are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some men
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a burn on each side: and cut each one with a needle as sharp as possible, cutting through to the bone: and do this through the breadth of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a sponge under the artery, and cut above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which leaps inside with great jumps
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure three digits from the ear.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with incisions, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this according to the quantity which you see from the patient's wound and the filling of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider for the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the bone from the scraping, then cut that away, so that there does not happen a stiff swelling: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temperaments.</start_of_turn>
Caput III.	Chapter 3.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an ancient headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humilities and warmth in the lacerations of the temperaments, or ancient soda, which is harmful, and similar to these: and it is medicated with the methods of medical treatment, and does not depart from it: then we are experts in the extraction of arteries from the temperaments, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.</start_of_turn>
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the manner of the operation in the extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is in the temperaments, and exposes the apparent artery in the temperament.</start_of_turn
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few people, or because of excessive cold.</start_of_turn
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with anything he has: then rub the place with rough cloth.</start_of_turn
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Until the steam rises to the surface like hot water, the phenomenon shall be evident.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then grasp the sponge, which is before your eyes in its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then strip off the skin with it [the sponge] until you reach the artery.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw the ligature into the loop and draw it upwards, until you have pulled the ligature out from the skin, and made it retract from the tunics beneath it on all sides.</start_of_turn>
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is small: then loop the ligature around the extremity of the needle.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it the part according to the length of its extremities, and tighten, and the blood flow will cease.</start_of_turn
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut through, or if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend fully.</start_of_turn
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash from the blood about six ounces, until three.</start_of_turn
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with a strong thread, of silk: or with horsehair, so that it does not become putrefied before the wound has consolidated, and the blood flow is restored.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the surplus, which is between the two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or an hour later.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if necessary, cauterize the skin with a cautery until the extremities of the ligature have been cut through, and it has stabilized in the place of the work.</start_of_turn
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to do the work when the patient has a normal temperature, or slightly feverish, than when the patient is feverish.</start_of_turn
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since the cautery is from the earth, which moves towards the completion of moistnesses.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore is the application better.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the cautery be applied to the old place: and that it be placed over the middle of the wound.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the closing it is to be cared for with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with sponges, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Which if, during the work, blood flows from the artery, then it is proper to cut off the same with the cautery, or to place the cautery at the place of the blood vessel: and hold your hand, until the blood is stopped
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	Which if nothing of these is present, then put over the place your finger, until the blood congeals
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embroider the place with cold water, until the pain is quieted, and be bound according as it is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from this it is evident that it is more easy and manageable to extract the artery, when this cautery has two blades: and that the sharpness of the two blades is similar to that of an almond
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Yet are these of much less sharpness than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are sharp, like two blades, both are apt to cause frost: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since therefore in the earth there is somewhat of thickness, it is held in the earth the heat of fire, and the flesh is quickly cut off: with this therefore the work is better in all respects, and easier, and more manageable
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two blades be as much as the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and place both of them alight, until they reach the bone, and cut the artery in two places: that it may be prolonged which is between the extremities of it.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	They do not solidify with this deep burn.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the burn.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Be attentive to acute tear-lachrymal fluid from the eyes
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are viscous and flow from the eyes, which are above the outer part of the head: then it does not require any medical treatment from physicians, and the liquid makes the face of the patient red, and he feels a wandering in his face like the wandering of ants: and his eyes are swollen and wet, as though they were corroded by something: and his eyelids are reddened from the intensity of the tears. Then the old people say in the treatment of these things by means of an operation, and they call this treatment "Ense".
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	It is also necessary to remove the hairs in front of his face from the patient
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions at an equal distance from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at an equal distance from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lower lip, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as the thickness of three fingers together. And let a sponge be prepared, or dry cloth, with which to soak up the blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the sponge of two acute extremities, whose following shape is like this.</start_of_turn>
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is at the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with a sponge, which is over the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do it also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract the sponge and introduce another instrument, which is called the sharp scalpel, from one wide side, not from the acute side
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its acute side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its wide side towards the bone: and push it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do it also from the middle incision up to the second incision
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when blood has flown out in an equal amount, express the place from coagulated blood clots
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every incision a patch of coarse cotton, and put over that soaked wool pads in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no swelling occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day heal the ligament, and give an abundant infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it from the ointment of basil, and leave the rest of the wounds to heal: until they are healed
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the care of sharp tears and catarrh to the eyes from the inside of the head
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When these occur to anyone with acute, itchy, sticky tears: and when their eyes are extended, parched, and the sight is impaired: and the eyelashes are ulcerated, and hair falls out from the eyelids, and there is acute pain in the depths of the head, which brings about sneezing: then take away from these causes all those matters, and the catarrh will not come from these unless from many tears.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best treatment in these cases is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	The best is to shave the patient's face thoroughly.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence from the left ear towards the right ear: and reach the incision up to the bone: and stretch your hand from the edges of the wounds which move with chewing until the bone is reached: and you will extract all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with wool or strips of linen
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that they do not cause a cold abscess
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	When you have finished, and you see that the abscess is about to disappear: then it is necessary to rub the bone until new flesh begins to form on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for yourself with a regimen of nourishment that promotes the growth of flesh: such as if you were to take from wheat flour two parts and from barley four parts: and prepare from these a paste, and administer it to the wounds
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the care of these things that fall in autumn.
Caput VI.	(The text ends here.)
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls in autumn is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron, or gold: or it is from a plant, such as lentil, and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, and vinegar, and blood, or something similar to these things.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When such a stone or kind of stone is fallen in autumn which does not grow in autumn from the earth, it exposes the autumn to the sun: if you wash the stone, then distil from oil or vinegar something from the earth in autumn.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then manage the extraction of it, and make the patient sit upright with his head supported, and anoint the nostrils near the site of the incision, after you have placed around the circumference of the ear a piece of cloth or wool, and extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many are the things that depart with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If, however, they do not depart, then manage the extraction of it with sponges, that is, fine sponges: whose form is like this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If they depart with the sponge, that is good
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then manage the extraction of it with a blunt needle of small size.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not depart by this, then make a hole in the air, and insert the extremity of the needle into the ear much, and anoint what is around the needle with fat, so that there be no air in it: then draw out with your hand with force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many are the things that depart with this which we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not depart in this way: then take from chaff or from blood, that is, prepared gluten, with which one captures doves, a remedy: and place it in the extremity of the radius after you have encircled above the knee bent downwards: then insert it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not depart with all that we have said, then prepare for cutting, before the swelling becomes great, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of the incision is like that of a phlebotomy in the forehead: and draw out from the blood according to the measure of its virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and support his ear upwards, and find the opening of the ear close to its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the bone: then take out the instrument with that which you are able.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then seal the wound from this hour with speed, and care for it, until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If a foreign body has fallen into the wound from one grain which is growing and swelling, then administer its extraction.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey your command to come out, then take hold of a soft sponge, fine and smooth, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains that have fallen into the wound, and do not make that which you think is moist from the vapor of the ear, until you have put on many plugs: then extract them with hooks, or with fine fingers, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it.</start_of_turn>
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But when water enters the wound, the patient must be ordered to sneeze forcefully at first: and immediately moisten the wound with a little bit of old cloth: and it is placed over the wound which is in the water.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through this, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, round, smooth, and warm them with fire slightly, and let the patient put one finger into his ear: and salt his foot one from this side, and strike with another stone against the stone which is in the wound.</start_of_turn
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water has come out.</start_of_turn
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water comes out like this, take from the fire, or from a single jug, and introduce one extremity into the wound: and kindle the other extremity with fire, until most of it is consumed.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the procedure with another sponge, making it much more thorough, until all the water has drained out: and extract the sponge with a tube as directed previously in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal within the body, if it is small in size, like a flea or its kin, take care of it as I have said in the instructions.</start_of_turn>
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if the body is large, which appears to the sense: then manage the extraction of it with hands and instruments: and thus its matter will be easier for all who hold it in the hand.</start_of_turn
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm that has generated in the gold, when you have cured it as we have said in the instructions on distillation, and in the treatise on the distillation of urine, and its cure does not suffice: then you must burn the gold in the sun.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with hands or with fine instruments.</start_of_turn
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a tube whose shape is like this, narrow below and wide above: and insert the lower extremity into the gold according to the amount that the sick person tolerates: then suck with it.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Make it much more thorough, until all the worms have drained out.</start_of_turn
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you with regard to the draining out, then smear around the circumference of the tube with lead, as I have said in the stone.</start_of_turn
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not drain out with this, then perform distillations which the ancient experts are experienced in concerning the junction of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.</start_of_turn
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be such as that which flows out of oil and medicines into the gold with this instrument whose shape is like this.</start_of_turn
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As for wounds made from silver or from air, below is a stricture in which there is a small hole, and above it is broad.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Thus as for wounds inflicted by silver or air, below is a stricture in which there is a small hole, and above it is broad.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	If you will, take a sponge, and moisten its extremity with a poultice of lint: then pour oil, or succum, or whatever you will of these medicines into the tube: and let it be well closed: then introduce the sponge with the poultice above, and compress it with your hand until oil is squeezed out into the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be made warm with a little fire: and beware lest anything be distilled in it when cold: for medicine does not bear that.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	And concerning the care of wounds inflicted by gold.
Caput VII.	(The provided text does not include any information regarding "The care of wounds inflicted by gold," so I am unable to translate this sentence.)
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Whenever some children come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes it happens also that some people have their ears opened up by a wound, or by meat being born in it
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this opening up happens sometimes in the depth of the ear-hole, which does not follow the usual course: and sometimes it happens outside the small hole of the ear, and follows the usual course.</start_of_turn>
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens in the depth of the ear and which is not comprehended by the aspect, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.</start_of_turn>
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And as for that which follows the usual course, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sun, and to press on it: then if the wound appears, open the hole with a fine lancet whose form is like this which follows, and let its extremity be in the part which has a small width, and whose part is acute: and the rest of the lancet should be soft on both sides: so as not to harm the ear.</start_of_turn
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If, therefore, the swelling has arisen from the meat of the ear: then hold one finger under the skin, and pierce with ease until the whole flesh has been removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the swelling is deep in the ear: then take a fine needle, thread it, and burnish with fire: then remove it from the meat of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel swelling with pain, which the sick person has with a weighty ear, try to open it with ease: and be careful, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a quantity of unguent according to the extent of the opening which you made in the Egyptian bandage: do this for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a salve and mix it with rose-water, and sprinkle over it fine powder of burnt ochre, and use it thus.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you wish to remove the swelling from the ear: then it is necessary to extract the salve and leave it with another salve which you mix with rose-water, which you put in a vessel made of beeswax: let the swelling become cold: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flows: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the blood which is said in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	(The text continues with instructions on how to treat eye ailments.)
Caput VIII.	(The heading of the next section is not included in the provided text.)
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Althelis which happen in the eyes when they are humid and are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with nails: or with a finger, and pierce them with a needle from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place above the wound a piece of sponge.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	It is better to cauterize after the incision has been made.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many things return when something remains of their root
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	When they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Take care of the great palpebrae of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye that assimilate Crandinum in its substance, and its hardness, and because of this it is called Great: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation is like this: if there is a Greatness proceeding from the palpebrae, which appears from the palpebra and moves to all parts, then it is easy to remove it
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find it above the opening by its width
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it out from all around with ease until it is removed
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a thread and cut it off.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If it is not prepared to be cut, except when you pierce the palpebra with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the incision is large: then join it together with a suture: and take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause any harm from it.</start_of_turn
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment restores itself and becomes flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	If it is large and extends deep into the ear, turn the ear inwards and suspend the greater part with a hook: for it is not necessary to make an incision, and press upon it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the palpebra is prolonged by an incision, it does no harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with salt water: and care for the place with it which has become flesh, until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The eyelids are greasy substances which are generated in the upper eyelid tissues: and most of them happen to children. And they weigh down the eyes of them, and cause tears to fall from them in the mornings, and they cannot see the sunlight because of this, because the tears run down their faces, and because of this the eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which are swollen from the inflation: and the prominence of the Axirnath is seen in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to treat it is to put the patient's head in your lap
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen, and prepare in it a hook, and make from that hook a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath from all sides
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	And put it on the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of it humidity with slippery ointment applied to the split, and do not make a split greater than that which is made in phlebotomy at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Either the entire skin must be stripped off, until it reaches Axirnath, or from the fissures the latter proceeds from, following the shape of the white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Either the entire skin must be stripped off, until it reaches Axirnath, or from the fissures the latter proceeds from, following the shape of the white fat.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, you must add slightly in the fissure until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the fat as we have said before.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the fat in vinegar and water, and place it on the place, and bind it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who anoint salt, and put it into the cavity of the fissure, so that it liquefies what remains of that moisture
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, blood appears in the place of the clot, then care for it with cold compresses until it heals
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the treatment of the eye, that is, when the eyelids are softened, from which it results that the eye becomes red as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When in the eyelids of the eye hairs are added beyond their course under the natural hair, and are increased: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as excessive tears, and softening of the eyelids, and mucus, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp instruments, as is prescribed in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and stitching.</start_of_turn>
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by needles, as I shall say.</start_of_turn
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.</start_of_turn>
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then grasp the lower eyelid with your left hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is grasped, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle through the skin at the place where the lash hair originates, and pass the needle together with the thread, and bring the thread up through the skin near the hair roots, where the hair arises: and draw the thread upwards towards the eyebrow, and tie it securely.</start_of_turn
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hair the fat that hangs down from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton wool or gauze: then mark over the eye with ink, so that it looks like the figure of a myrtle leaf.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	It is true that the figure must be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies in different people.</start_of_turn
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	And from this it is evident that the amount of excision which should be made from the eyelid is great, according to the amount that is softened by the eye.</start_of_turn
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when the fat is found above two lines which you have marked, and you have reached from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland, make a single incision near the natural hair, as thick as the radius.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then strip off the entire skin.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join together the two lips with a suture, with needle and fine thread: and drain the blood, and make fast what is superfluous from the threads above the two superciliums, with some useful material, if you wish to do so: or if not, do not care
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and thread for three days, or four: then care for it
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the wound without suture, and care for it with oil, which will dry and harden it
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelids swell up at the sealing of the wound and its collection: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Such a way of treating was taught by the ancient Ataxmirans
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	It is true that there is concern over the infirm person, but this comes from a good operation, and not from fear
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method in Ataxmir is as follows: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to the shape of this sign, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with the equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then grasp the point where the thread is, and insert it in the middle of the sign: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and another thread near the smaller lacrimal gland: and join together the two threads with the equal length of the suture
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand equally high: and elevate the skin above that which is marked on the limb, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then close the two lips of the wound with suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If indeed swelling occurs at the incision of your wound, or a tear of the wound: retain that swelling with earth, and with like things, from unguents sitting.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And whenever the eyelids also swell, so that their hair is twisted: convert their hair.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is an artificial thing.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	As for care of Ataxmir with dogs.</start_of_turn
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you cover the eye, and split the tear which is inside, according as I have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two incisions, or two small sticks under the lash: whose length is according to the length of the eye, and the width of them less than the width of the pupil: and I shall insert the thread at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the thread.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then close both with a suture over that which is superfluous from the eye, and bind the two threads from both parts strongly, and let go of it every few days.</start_of_turn
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin will therefore become strict, and will die, and will become black, until it falls away of itself.</start_of_turn
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If indeed it is delayed, then cut through it with scissors.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When the bone is firmly set, elevate the eyelids: and do not puncture the hair.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	This is the shape of two nails, which you make according to this figure and their quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	About the elevation of the hair piercing in the eye with the needle
Caput XII.	Chapter XII
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it through a fine silk thread, soft
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its extremities and knot both knots with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be one palm
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make a second fine knot under this in a short space, and knot its extremities if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then put the patient's head in your lap, and let it rest close to the cheek so that the operation is evident: because the operation is slight, or even almost insignificant.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the thread under the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair up to the thread: and introduce into the thread the light of one, or two, or three hairs, not more
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the thread in the eyelid with the natural hair
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, you pull out the thread, and the hair does not come out with it: pull out the thread to the lower part, with the thread which you made in it, until the thread comes out from the upper hole, and you see the eye: then indeed pull out the thread and the needle: and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has adhered to its place and has grown over the wound
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hair, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
Caput XIII.	Of the care of the upper eyelid.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this occurs with the eye, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This care is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental care is thus done by the consolidation of a wound, or section, or cautery, and the like
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of the operation in this is that you find the consolidation, and that you separate the lips, and put between them a piece of linen, and bind it, until it is healed
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And do not use in the care of this that which excites and contracts: for if you do this, the Alxatrati will deteriorate more than before: rather use those things which soften, such as chaff: and mix with water, in which barley is boiled, seed of flax: and oil of lard, which is liquefied with some oil: and apply it with the linen, and care for it
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your skill in the care of this is that you are able to concoct with every ingenuity, so that it does not solidify, according to the form which was in the beginning
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this care, which we have mentioned, is not except for some rectification of the Alxatrati, so that it does not regain the form of the place which was throughout
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Of the care of the Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	The lower part of the head is called the Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	It is caused by a wound, or a fracture, or a burn, or things like these
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way to perform the operation in this case is to take hold of the needle which has two threads, and pass it through the meat from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread comes out at the two extremities of the meat
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the meat upwards with the needle, and cut the vein with a broad blade.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the outline of the eye returns to its proper position, it is good
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	If not, take a suture, and pass it through the wound, and tie it with the eye: and find two holes in the inner side of the eye, and let the two ends of the holes come out from two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: and when they meet they will form the figure of the eye once more. And this is the Greek laudation letter
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	And remove the meat to the amount of its acute lower angle from the eye which follows the eye-lash
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	And join the separated parts together: sew them with a thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said, with soothing medicines and ointments, until they heal
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alxatrati occurs from a wound, or a suture, or a burn: then you must find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as before
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a liner as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And thus the conclusion of the discourse concerning the care of Alxatr [i.e. the surgeon] is that when he is above or below, his care in this operation is as it is prepared according to the form of Alxatr.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For there are many varieties in form: and a prudent artificer prepares the ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, until he brings the figure back to a natural form, or almost so, and even the patient himself, according as it is convenient for him from the operation and the instruments in various arrangements
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Whenever such a consolidation happens to many people, it is like the consolidation of the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and it hinders its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	You must therefore introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or stretch it out with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as acute as the incision of the spatula, but rather blunt and shallow: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that it may be easily withdrawn, and that the eye may return to its natural shape: and that the adhesion should be entirely healed
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour water and salt into the eye, with water washing it out: or instill it from a sieve made from millet seeds boiled in water
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the lip from the eye with a liner of linen: and place above the eye lanolin infused with alum or wool: and on the third day remove the sieve and the solids, until it is healed
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the prominence of meat near the tear-ducts.
Caput XVI.	On the incision of the nail and the prominence of meat near the tear-ducts.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is fleshy: and is similar to soft wax, thick and brittle
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, resembling frozen white moisture: which, when it touches iron, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, breaks off and does not remain in it
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both of these kinds do not begin until from the greater tear-duct, until it has proceeded somewhat, until it covers the useful thing, and excludes light and movement of the eye
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of working in its incision is: as you place your diseased head in your lap
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes, and lift its eyelid with your hand
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a hook a few times, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the needle, and pierce the meat through the hair of the horse, and blood, or fat: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle at the base, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and stretch the nail upwards: and remove the skin surrounding the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were scraping the nail with the skin until its extremity
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	And then cut the rest in the root of the tear-duct with a fine sponge, or with small forceps: and let the natural meat of the tear-duct go, so that it does not impede the course of the tears from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	When the finger is stretched out with only one (digit), or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be scraped with a soft sponge, the shape of which is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	Take care that the sponge does not touch the tough tunic of the cornea, and that you make an incision in it, and perforate the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some powdered salt, or extract it from barley, and leave it in for another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	And take care of it until it is healed
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the finger is neither nerve nor bone, and does not bend inwards, and does not swell, then this kind of finger heals in many ways with the doctors, and heals as I have said before
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and take out the tough inner membrane, soft, thin and acute, according to this form
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And cut off the fingernail above the root with sharpness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming rare and crumbling, and has burst in the root, then pour out from your hour glass into the eye from barley, or from red barley, or powdered salt: and anoint the eye until tomorrow
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation until it is completely healed
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Except that there is a soft callous in the eye: then leave it in and care for the callous until it is healed
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation above with care until it is healed
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the tear sac, if it is causing great pain in the eye, is to be grasped with one finger, and cut off a part of it: do not make the incision at the end, lest you cause the flow of tears to be blocked
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then stop the bleeding from the tear-gland with a red sponge, or made from sponge-grass, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	After the excision of the gland and the natural elevation in the eye
Caput XVII.	From the excision of the gland and the elevation of the tissue in the eye
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of men there is a red substance composed of blood, or superposed, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelashes, and perhaps turns the eyelashes outwards: and it is absorbed like the dust of roses
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is also an operation for it, that you put your hand over his head.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all the flesh with the nails that are convenient for that: and hold that with one hand, or grasp it with your hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until you have finished all of it with the chisel
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn away from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and make your incision as we said in the excision of the nail: or with fine scissors, with which you collect the fat, as it will appear after this head
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete, and you have removed all the gland, then put the eye out from salt that is ground together: or distill into it a powder of red, and things like these from corrosive physicians: and put over the eye a foreign cover with white wool or linen: to prevent from the heat.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the gland, and you dominate the hot blood, and wait for the swelling to subside: then let go of the eye, and care for it with that which will settle the swelling
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	Proceed in like manner as when meat is added which has happened in the eye from this sort.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	Proceed in like manner as when meat is added which has happened in the eye from this sort.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	In like manner as when meat has been added and has occurred in the eye of this kind.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The veins which are red and cover the eye, and which prevent the liquid from operating: and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, first of all, you must consider whether the eye in which there is Sebel is strong and there is no other injury in it except for the Sebel: then collect the Sebel from it
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is fitting to place your head on your lap
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook or two, according to your prudence: and let the hook be of fine wire, like a double thread, or two hooks be graduated in one body, like this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with caution, and drain blood an hour after an hour, until you have removed the veins from the eye and they have dissolved: and take care not to damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation so that you do not cut anything except for the veins
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill in the eye a little oil, or blood: so that its sharpness may restore what remains of the Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible to collect the whole in this hour, then plaster the eye with wax, which will soothe the eye's pain. And send it away for a few days until the pain has subsided: and keep it away from a warm compress. And then repeat over it again in the same manner until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the shears.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the swelling of the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Doctors call the swelling of the nose "Fistula," which they cure with cautery or with acute medicine burning, as the case demands
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in that: except that you find a boil on the swelling near its origin, and you extract all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is clean
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is thus extracted, and the cavity is washed, or blackened, then fill it again with the instrument whose form is this
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	This is called the "Asperation of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it of iron, and let its head be round like an azure, which is pierced with the point of a lime, or with the point of an awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it upon the place of the corrupted bone
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then pull it out between your fingers, and you press your hand near, until you know that the corruption is gone: and do it quickly
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal astringents.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If thus the place is consolidated, and there is formed in it flesh, and the swelling subsides: and there remains for forty days, and it does not rise again, and there is no inflammation, and no accident occurs in it: then you know that it is healed
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	If not, then it is not in the ingenuity of that man, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	If not, then it is not in the ingenuity of that man, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, in this fashion.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be close to the lacrimal gland: and stretch out your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the thumb, until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is painful: by this you will know that the air has escaped from it, when you keep your hand over your nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with the physicians who are stifling, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh has healed, and the place has hardened: then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: so it is easier to do that over the painful area.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ Regarding the reduction of the swelling of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye swells completely, and does not yield to any treatment, neither by reduction nor by medication: then it is necessary to dissolve the swelling: then perform a bloodletting: afterwards place poultices in the cavity without making an incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a unguent made from acacia, and aloe, and oil, and gum arabic.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above over the dressing with many sponges.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the way of making the sponges is: that you take fine sponges, many, and double every sponge over four: make many from them: then place one over another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with strong leather
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	Repeat the procedure with the stomach using suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Repeat the procedure with the stomach, and keep the eye closed for a day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the ligament is again softened, it must be tightly bound: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said before
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If blood therefore escapes from the eye again after the application of the ligature, it is good: but if not, then repeat the application of the dressing, the sponges, the tight dressing, and the suction, until the patient is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Regarding the incision of the abdominal cavity.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the abdominal cavity, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and will be formed like a man due to that: then it is necessary to make an incision in that place. The operation in this case is as follows: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the intestine from the lower part to the upper part
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a doubled thread from the lacrimal part, and make it pass through: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then pierce the place of the doubled thread, and bind it around the part of the intestine with the needle: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place above the eye a lanolin swab in albumin: and leave it there until the thread is cast out with the intestine
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound is healed
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the intestine is tightly bound from all around with a circle of cloth, until it has added the eye a great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
Caput XXII.	Then it is pierced with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and moisture of albumin flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately fills: then bind it up until it is healed.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not simply an inflammation, but a healing which has gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the ailment itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of dealing with it is to make the patient sit over a prepared seat, or directly
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of his head with your hands from two parts, and move it around until you see the healing return to the lower part of his eye
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then tighten it up, and do not let it descend, and open the pupil: and the patient will see as well as before: and if it does not descend further, you know that it is water
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the healing of the eye is not prepared to descend with that which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine needle and pierce with it above the corneal membrane at the circumference where it joins the cornea in a crown, until the healing comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out, then instill in the eye lukewarm water in which honey has been mixed: or water in which barley flour and honey have been boiled: then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	When it has come out, then instill in the eye lukewarm water in which honey has been mixed: or water in which barley flour and honey have been boiled: then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have spoken of ten kinds of water in the process of irrigation, which are declared and explained by the expert; take them according to the soundness of the patient.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you must make the patient sit with his shoulder blades against your hands, opposite the light, near the heel: and bind his eye securely, and tighten it: then take hold of the eyelid of his eye which has the water in it, with your right hand, if the eye which has the water is the left, or your left hand if the eye which has the water is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with the thumb, if the eye is left: or your left hand if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the thumb at the crown near the apparent white of the smaller lacrimal gland: then push the thumb with force: and you will know when the thumb has gone through to the bottom of the eye socket
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the thumb should reach the depth of the eye socket, measuring the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: which is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the thumb until it reaches the place where the water is
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then push the lower eyelid downwards one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If, therefore, water comes down immediately, then the patient should shut his eye immediately and the thumb will be in his eye
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water comes down again, then remove the thumb once more, except when the thumb is coming out
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When the limb hangs down and does not rise up: then extract the foreign body easily and you will gradually restore your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water something from clear salt crystals: and wash with it when the eye is closed.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye the whole wad of cotton, or wool soaked in rose-water, and alum: and bind with it the healthy eye
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are with us in this time, place upon it a firm compress with alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If it does not yield to the foreign body at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard and cold: then you must take a sponge, which is called Alberid, whose shape is like this
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Fetch the sponge with the hand itself only, and do not touch the hand with the thumb: and do not do anything except to put the foreign body in its proper place under the eye
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the foreign body, as we have said
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in addition to that, prepare a soft bed in the center of the room, on which he may lie with his face downwards in a dark room: and prevent all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all.</start_of_turn>
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And keep the dressing in accordance with its custom until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then take it out of that dark room and let him see: and make him drink something.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the dressing until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And do not do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather do it when others are there: because water ascends quickly through a wide opening
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, the boil becomes hardened: then it is necessary to drain the eye before the seventh day. And rectify that with what rests upon it that sits upon the boil until it subsides: then truly to make use of the eye itself, and place over its face an oral bandage which regulates the use of the eye for a few days, even though it exists in the dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	The eye must be gradually withdrawn from the room and returned to its place.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	Know that in the dark one must not be excused from vision for a long time: then indeed he will hear of the operation.</start_of_turn>
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.

¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Of the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various meats are born in the nose of a carnas, from which there is something that is assimilated by many scorpions' feet: and from this there is a cancerous flesh, a stone, of a dusky colour: and from this is what is soft flesh, not of a dusky colour.</start_of_turn
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	If any flesh from these carnivorous animals is soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you must make the sick man sit with his hands opposite you, open his mouth, and expel the tongue from his flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut off what you have apprehended from them with a fine, acute scalpel from one side, until you know that the whole flesh has been excised.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of that from whose excision is impossible: then cut that with a fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood should dominate it, or a thick clot adhere: then oppose it by that which is appropriate: or that from malignant clots, then cauterize it until the blood is severed, and remove all the flesh.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then expel it through the nose after the incision of the vein, and water, or liquid.</start_of_turn>
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If indeed the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that he is already healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If indeed moisture does not penetrate, according to what is appropriate, then you know that flesh has been born within the upper bones of the nose, which does not come out with the incision of the instrument.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore it is necessary to insert a thread of fine caliber which has some bulk, and to knot it in such a way that there are many knots in it: and put between every knot the quantity of digit, or less: and the patient shall blow out one end of the thread through the nose with the greatest possible force: and he shall expel the stench until it reaches the heel, and depart from his guttur.</start_of_turn>
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many do the like of this like the young boys in the schools: and it is easy for him who wishes it.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the boy, one which projects above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then secure the flesh with sutures at the points which are in the boy's flesh.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is again with the knots of the boy.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread: and place in the nose after the bleeding has ceased a little of the unguent which you drank with the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten up all that remains of the flesh
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place in the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, treatment is needed which exceeds this, use something else.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For a head injury make a cautery, with which oil is distilled, and other medicines in the nose, do this of silver, or of brass: which is like the nut of the fennel, opened like a conch shell: and its passage is like that of the reed
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.</start_of_turn>
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the tube of the instrument for making a head injury be full, detected: which has a handle at its back, with which you grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to take from wax, and from fluxes.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Of the care of the eye of the nose.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXV.	Day 25.</start_of_turn
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times the eye of the nose is born in the extremity of the nose of Thelus, and it grows large, and increases with the days, until the wound has become like its aspect.</start_of_turn
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, it should be cut through in order to evacuate its entirety.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place above it either a cautery or a burning medicine which is placed in its place
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, its incision is delayed until it has become large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard or brown in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with the iron; for the tumor is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For there are many waters which issue from the incision of tumors, and which cause great harm to the body which had them
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	If, however, the tumor is soft to the touch, not brown in color, and the waters which issue from its incision are possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place where it was excised until it is healed
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	As for the suture of the nose, the lip, and the ear
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of continuity happens in cartilaginous matters, it offers little support in that operation, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, when anything happens from that, that you consider whether there is a wound which has been made with blood: and then join the edges of the wound with a suture: then care for it until it is healed
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuous solution of the lips has already been separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to scour all the parts from the skin outwards until they bleed again.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the lips with a suture, and bind them, and sprinkle above it dragon's blood and balsam: and place above the powder a plaster plug, and some other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then solve it yourself, and move the medicine: and let it go, until the threads are severed by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the unguent, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	As for the way of stitching, it is such that it joins the solution of continuity, or with a weight, as we say in the stitching of the belly: or join the solution with the thread, as you have been told.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of lip knots.</start_of_turn
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer pain in the insides of their lips because of hard bumps resembling seeds of herbs. Some of these are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find over every bump of it, and suspend it with a thread, and cut it away from all around.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with dry wool, until the blood is clotted.</start_of_turn
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then bandage it with vinegar, and care for the place with it, where there is a styptic, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of the flesh of a newly-formed tooth on the gum.</start_of_turn
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many are born on the gum, flesh added by the ancients, whom they call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary to suspend it with a thread: or grasp it with forceps, and cut it at the root of its socket, and let the blood run, or the pus go out.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place upon the site of the wound a piece of beeswax, or other adhesive powders, and soak them.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns to its place after treatment, which often happens, then repeat the incision a second time, and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Regarding the tooth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they gather on the surfaces of the tooth from the inside and outside, and between the gums there are rough and hard coatings, and when they decay, and the dentine becomes soft and greenish, until corruption reaches the gum, and inflammation of the teeth results.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore to keep the hand steady between your thumbs, and to place the head of the instrument in your mouth, and to grasp the tooth and the socket, where you see the coatings, like sand: until something remains from it, and do the same with black pigment, and greenishness, and yellowness, and other things until they are gone.</start_of_turn
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore the thing which is in the tooth from the beginning of the treatment is removed, that is good: and if not, then repeat the treatment on the third day, and the fourth, and the fifth, until you have finally completed the study of that which you desire.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you know that teeth need different rasps of various forms, many figures: according to the preparation for your operation: because the rasp which files the tooth from the lower part is different from the rasp which files between the teeth, according to other figures.</start_of_turn
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these figures of rasps are prepared for you, which you will find.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	The teeth must be cured of their pain with all possible skill, and afterwards their eradication is to be aimed for.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	There is no remedy for it [tooth pain] which does not vanish when the tooth is eradicated: for its substance is lofty; except when there is no other remedy to be had, then it is permitted that the sick man eradicate it, that it may harden, and that he may be certified by thee that the tooth is painful
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many, indeed, deceive the sick with their pain and assert that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: but the pain does not vanish until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we do not see that it [tooth pain] departs from the operation of phlebotomy.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is certified by thee that the tooth is painful itself, then it is permitted that you sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some skill, until the gum is separated from all sides: then move the tooth with thy fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have broken it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place there [the forceps] in a great location well: and the head of the sick man between thy knees: for it is well held thus, because it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its right, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is permitted that you fill that hole with wool: and string it with the extremity of a fine radius, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is permitted that you should take great care with the scarring around the gum from all parts much
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	Be strong and resolute, lest you break yourself, and let a part of you remain, so that you may depart from the infirmity greater than the pain which was in it at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Do not attempt that which you know not, for phlebotomists in their frenzy often do harm rather than good. Be courageous in its extirpation, but let us administer what we have narrated
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many indeed make their wounds grow worse by touching great illnesses of men, for the greater part of them is liable to break, and leave roots of themselves behind, or to draw out the whole with some bones of the jaw: as we have been told.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is to be closed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is a discharge of blood from the place (for many indeed thus happen), then there is something from the vessel there, and implement with it the place: and if not, cauterize it if it does not suffice to restore the vessel.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps which are used to grasp the tooth in the first place should be of fine form, their handles long, their thumbs short, their bodies broad, so that they do not bend when pressure is put on them when they are pressed against the tooth: they should be like strong fingers, until when they are bound to the tooth, they do not bite the tooth itself, neither do they bend: the handles should be short, and they should be made of iron, or of well-fashioned steel, with directed handles, and in their handles there should be teeth, some of which are retained in some way, and which bind the constriction loosely, strongly
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the handles are of such a shape as the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia, and are strong, there are strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured bones of the jaw
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When the tooth remains at the root, and breaks something, then it is necessary that you place butter over the place of the tooth for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce into the cavity a sponge or forceps: the extremities of which absorb the pulp which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the forceps.</start_of_turn>
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file or like an awl.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, they do not yield to these forceps, then it is necessary that you place the jaw over the root, and remove the whole flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called a small spatula, which is shaped like this.</start_of_turn
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The handle of the instrument should be short and broad: and it should not be wet, lest it break.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to bite with these instruments again.</start_of_turn
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first triangle of the extremity has some thickness.</start_of_turn
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The second triangle of the extremity is thin.</start_of_turn
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument which has two branches, which has this shape.</start_of_turn
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which are necessary for the reason of the teeth.</start_of_turn
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also necessary to bite with this instrument which absorbs a large bone, of this shape, triangular extremity rotated, which has some thickness, so that it does not break: and it should not be wet.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	Know that the instruments for teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments, they do not all work in the same way. And a skillful craftsman, skilled in his art, will himself discover the appropriate instrument for each operation and its related ailments.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For since the ailments for which instruments are needed are diverse, the ancients did not speak of a single instrument for all of them
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the jawbone is fractured from the mandible, or from any other bone of the mouth, or if it becomes putrefied: then one must examine the area carefully with the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the extraction of teeth, and handle it with care, for its form is like this
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	And let there be something of length in it, so that it may be tied up or held with the bone, and that it does not slip away and break, until the bone has been extracted: and restore the place with the physicians who are suitable for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from its putrefaction and care for it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Concerning the closure of teeth that protrude over others.
Caput XXXII.	End of book.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude abnormally from their natural course, a wound is made by that which gives them that shape: and especially when it happens in women and girls, because of their soft gums.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to take care of this
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and has not been positioned, or if it is possible to close it, or to file it down: then extract it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it away with this instrument which has this shape
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small face, and is made of iron, with acute extremities.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such as you would make in many days, because of the hardness of the teeth, and that it does not break through the teeth of others.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, there is an exposure of the edges of the teeth: then ligate the teeth with a file made of iron, whose form is like this.</start_of_turn>
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It is all of iron, and its handle has small points like a file: like a file with which the tooth is ground little by little in many days with ease, so that it does not break through the tooth, and falls out: then soften it, and afterwards polish it with some abrasives.</start_of_turn
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and has wounded the tongue: then it is necessary to ligate it also, until the sharpness of that fracture has gone, and it is equal: and flatten it, so that it does not wound the tongue, or corrupt the speech.</start_of_turn>
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	¶ As for the reposition of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens that the front teeth have concussion and displacement from a blow, or in a case: and it cannot be held together by the teeth themselves so that it does not fall out: and if swelling appears with blood clots, and treatment does not suffice: then wisdom dictates that they be bound with gold wire: because silver is easily tarnished and putrefies after a few days: but gold never changes.</start_of_turn
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of moderate thickness and strength according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.</start_of_turn
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the reposition is that you take hold of the wire, and pass through a loop of it between two healthy teeth: then you tie it with two extremities of the wire between the teeth that are loose, whether one or more, until you have secured it until you reach the other healthy tooth.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Repeat the procedure until you reach the part from which you commenced. Then grasp your hand with caution and wisdom, until it ceases to move forward: and establish your constriction as you would string a thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Repeat the procedure until you reach the starting point. Then grasp your hand cautiously and with wisdom until it ceases to move forward: and establish your constriction as you would string a thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is dissolved or if it breaks, string them together with another thread and keep them stable for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, like water
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it has happened that one tooth or two have fallen out due to an abscess or other cause in their places, and they have returned as we have said, and remain: this does not happen except by an artificer, a prudent and experienced person.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some bone or cartilage has been adjusted: and it is made like a tooth in shape, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth was extracted and stringed as we have said: and it remains, and serves its purpose for a long time
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament which is under the tongue happens naturally, as it is when a human is born, or accidentally, due to an injury which has healed over
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this case is to open the mouth of the patient in your hand, and elevate the tongue: then cut through that nerve of the ligament throughout its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there be anything hard and nodular in it, and if that be from the consolidation of a wound: then project into that the hook, and find that by its breadth, until you cut through the ligament, and the nodulation will be dissolved.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Take heed, that there be no fissure in the depth of the flesh, and cut through the artery there, and blood flow will be restored.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then collect in the wound the residue of the incision with rose-water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a bandage of linen, which will hold the patient firm throughout the night: so that it will not solidify again
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood flow should happen to be restored, then put upon the place a wet compress.</start_of_turn>
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood boils, then cauterize the place with a blunt cautery, which is appropriate for this: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Of the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there happens under the tongue a swelling which assimilates the small ranula, prohibiting the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it increases so much, that it fills the mouth.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	The operation in this is, that you open the mouth of the patient at the root of the tongue: and consider the swelling.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If there be blood of a dark or reddish color, hard, which the patient does not sense: do not touch it, for it is cancer.</start_of_turn
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines to whiteness, where there is moisture, then project into it the hook, and cut through it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all around.</start_of_turn
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows upon thee in the hour of thy operation, then place upon it a dry sponge, until the blood is severed: then return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	And bind it with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest with such treatment as is fitting for this, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of the two wounds of the amygdala.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When they happen between the gullet of the gods, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which happen outside: and which are called two amygdalae: when you have cured them with what we mentioned in the discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard wound, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather leave it alone, until it is healed
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either perforate it: or it will rupture by itself
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it off.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this is as you consider before your operation, if the wound of it has grown cold peacefully complete, or if there is imminent decrease: then do this: make the patient sit with his head towards the sun: and open the wound of him, and take hold of the flesh between your hands, and pull the tongue downwards with an instrument, which has this shape
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Make from silver, or from air, which is subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When thus you have said the word and the limb is exposed, and falls upon the part you wish to reach: then grasp the hook and hold it in safety, and draw it outwards as much as you can, without tearing anything from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then proceed with the instrument whose form follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	Like scissors: truly the extremities of these are bent inwards, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other at an angle: where care must be taken lest it should slip from the iron or be soaked in alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then proceed with the sponge, whose form is like this
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It is acute from one part, not from the other part.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incissated one side of the flesh, incissate the other according to this same kind of incision
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however blood flows from him, make him gargle with water in which coriander seeds are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and things like these from sponges: until the bleeding ceases: then care for him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are left in the gullet other abscesses, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Proceed with these in the same way as for the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I have cured a woman of an abscess which was in her throat, which was bringing her to a fainting spell, with little sense, because she was swallowing with difficulty: and the woman breathed with difficulty through a narrow passage, and I forbade her from eating and drinking: and she died within one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the after-pulse will ascend only as much as two branches emitted, until they go beyond two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	And the after-pulse will ascend only as much as two branches emitted, until they go beyond two nostrils.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	And then I draw it out, and from that part is a great portion taken out
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	And then I cut it off at the root of the nose
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	And then I do the same for the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	And then I open its mouth, and press its tongue: and afterwards I fix the hook in the after-pulse: then I cut off a part of it, and there does not flow much blood from it: it is absolutely like the gut of a woman, and immediately starts to drink water, and then accepts food
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	It does not cease to cut from that after-pulse for a long time: and the after-pulse follows the place from which I cut, until it becomes prolonged and joins with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised, and cauterized the after-pulse between the gut
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It remained from the addition: then I went away from the place, and I do not know what God did with it after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a small after-pulse.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrus descends to the lower part and there is an after-pulse, and it is long: then it is called a perpendicular one: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a great one
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in the explanation, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the after-pulse has become soft and quiescent from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is gathered round that is round, and has no length, and is blood-stained, or of a dusky colour, or black, and has no sensation: in such a case it is necessary to make an incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And there is fear of the disease upon the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you are performing the cure as I have mentioned from the white, and of its length, so that you make the patient sit forward facing the sun: and you will grasp his tongue with an instrument whose passage was mentioned before, and fix the flesh in one place, and draw it downwards: and cut through it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of two abscesses.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from that, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from that more, you will wound the bowels and the speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	And then after the incision use what we mentioned in the incision of two abscesses: and care for him until he is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the patient returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterization without fear and without hesitation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in this is not with anything except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	And then grasp his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned before.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	And then take from the water which I mentioned before and mix with burnt charcoal, and place it not thick, neither sparse, and touch it from that side which has the concave shape of this instrument
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	So that its extremities are in that side which holds the medicine in a concave way, like the concave shape of the radius of a conch shell
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with the medicine above the wound: and let the patient lie with his side open, so that the discharge from his mouth may flow out from within the medicine, so that it does not descend to the gut of the patient, and cause him pain.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first touch it over the wound for the quantity of half an hour, until you see that it has become softened, and rest the biting pain of the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take hold of the limb, and cover it with the medicine over the end of the radius, and inflate the limb with medicine, and insert the radius into the cannula above, until the limb adheres to the wound.</start_of_turn
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you complete what you wish concerning the cautery of the vein.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then remove the medicine: for it itself will dry and fall off in three days, or four.</start_of_turn
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if you think that the medicine has not been digested, repeat it: and after the cautery, remove the surrounding skin of the vein with the finger, and soak it in butter, and bandage it with that which is around it from the medicine: and cool it with cold water.</start_of_turn
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And care for the outside with stitches, and for the inside with gargles, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is this kind of treatment safer than an incision and longer lasting in fear.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the wound is healed even with the subtlest of cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.</start_of_turn
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sassafras, and chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and cover the pot with a lid: and put a hole in the middle of the pot, above which is made a concave instrument according to this method.</start_of_turn
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let air or metal enter: and the extremity is introduced into the cavity containing the pomegranate, until the vapor ascends to the upper opening of the cannula, until the opening is obscured by much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the same [procedure] several times, until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment in the beginning of an attack of inflammation.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	The procedure is useful only in a cold inflammation: and it must not be performed except when the inflammation has subsided.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present, then take a needle and make a hole in the extremity and introduce cork or resin: so that it does not burn the bone: because the cork or resin hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is a good treatment with safety.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many things adhere to the throat, such as bones of fish or thorns.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract what is seen to have fallen into the throat, after having previously drawn the tongue with an instrument at the angle of the jaw, and to declare that it is in the throat.</start_of_turn
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not seen but is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before food is eaten in the stomach.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore it will be discharged through vomiting.</start_of_turn
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient swallows a piece of poppy seed, or the root of licorice, or swallows a piece of dry bread: or grasps a piece of dry sea sponge and binds it with a thread, then swallows it.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When the limb approaches the place where the bones or spines are extracted, it is then driven out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out spontaneously as we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this fashion.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius of a bean, and at its end there must be a curvature, which intrudes into its gut with ease: and it must have its head elevated above
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	Beware of its touch to the epiglottis, that it does not cause him to cough, and drive with it bone, or spine, or the doctor himself must introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the patient should introduce it himself: this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he drives downwards, or pulls his hand upwards with the instrument, the whole thing according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it comes out
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of the blood vessel.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bleeding vessel is being treated with that which I have mentioned in the treatise on the treatment of wounds by the hands of doctors, and it does not stop, then consider in the belly of the patient at the root of the tongue, or behind the tongue after you have withdrawn the tongue with the instrument that I mentioned.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your hand slips upon the bleeding vessel, grasp it with a small clamp, or with fine forceps from the center
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with these: then take a curved needle, and introduce it into the belly of the patient near the gut: then introduce the needle into the cavity of the needle with burning iron with fire
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this several times: and the patient should abstain from all water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full measure of cold water and open his mouth wide with it: and he shall lick his own bone with it, and swallow nothing from it: and he shall drink water an hour after the other with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The bloodsucker is like him who feels the water falling from his hand.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not go away when we tell him, then we must fumigate the patient with mice, or with a sponge as an instrument which I mentioned in the fumigation of the wound
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it itself goes away.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in fumigation is that you take a vessel in which there are dates with fire: and the vessel be covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and make in that hole the end of the instrument.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then he throws the fumigation and places the patient's bone at the end of the tube and closes the bone, so that it does not escape the fumigation, until you know that the fumigation has gone away from the bloodsucker
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the bloodsucker immediately goes away.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	And if it does not go away, then repeat the fumigation many times
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient can tolerate the sitting position, and he can eat onions and garlic, and he must not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he go away with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the fashion of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is drawn out from the gut when it falls upon the wound.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like pincers, thus: except that it has that curvature which enters into the gut
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the wing of an ostrich, which is called a ciconia, in which there is a roughness of the lime: when it grasps something, it does not relinquish it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	And concerning the opening of abscesses, their section, and their care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abcesses are of various kinds, depending on the nature of the cause, for there are many causes of abscesses: and they differ in their perforation and their section in two ways.</start_of_turn>
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One kind of abscess is that which arises from humidity.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other kind is that which arises from the body itself.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess which arises in the head is different from that which arises in the belly: and an abscess which arises in a fleshy part is different from that which arises at a joint. And each one of these has its own judgement according to its operation.</start_of_turn
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	Some abscesses do not need to be perforated until after the decay of the matter and the completion of its process: and others need to be perforated while they are still raw and have not completed their process.</start_of_turn
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses which are close to a joint.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For an abscess which arises near a joint and persists, until it has decayed, may perhaps corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint: which is the cause of the contraction of that limb.</start_of_turn
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or an abscess which is in a limb: for if you delay its perforation until it has matured, it will cause pain or swelling or both in that limb.</start_of_turn
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is close to the anus, perforate it immediately: and it is not fitting to perforate a crude stool that is not completely digested, except when it is close to the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend inwards of the rectum, and form a fistula, or remain unhealed at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the stool, which is matured according to its completion: and it is with sedation of pain, recession of fever, and reduction of redness, and pulse, and an increased intensity of the head of the stool: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the perforation in a lower place of the stool, and more prominent: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the stool is in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places where there is no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those which reflect, do cautiously with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the stool is in the places of hardness: then it is better that you delay the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the disease from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and putrefaction, and possibly the lips of the wound will be prolonged, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some stools are perforated according to the breadth of the body by necessity: or according to that which the member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you manage in the small stools a moderate perforation, and in the large stools a wide perforation: or many sections similar in magnitude to the stool.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it happens when it is already made like a panus, and is made at the end, when it is already dead: as it happens with many things, as with dubelet, and with bubonibus.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are from those which are cut with a section having three angles
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are from those which are cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the apostema of the inguinal region
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are from those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar things from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, like the superficial leninous apostemata, must be pierced through a superficial perforation, or only planely
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it must be when the apostema is thick, and when there is much surrounding healthy tissue, that you perforate it, that you do not damage it and extract all the pus in that hour: rather extract from it a part of it
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then anoint the apostema until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until the patient is expelled: especially if the patient is feeble in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man decrepitus: for the spirit of the animal is resolved from the animal with the expulsion of the health: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not perceive it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore this chapter has great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated the apostema, which is what you do to the apostemata, you must remove the slime: and consider
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small abscess of a vein, either cut it off level with the surface or ligate the vein above.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If there is a large abscess and many holes of perforation, it is necessary to insert into each hole a ligature until they reach the innermost part.</start_of_turn>
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or if you have cauterized around it: then you must put in an old dressing, or as when a bandage is taken off, or cover it with dry wool: and hold it in place until the third day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and care for it until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however blood flows in your operation in this hour: then administer cold water and vinegar, after you have swallowed it with a piece of bread: and put it over the place where the blood is flowing profusely.</start_of_turn
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment, care, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of this book, and from experience.</start_of_turn
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is winter and the place of the abscess is full of nerves: then you must instill small sponges with wine and warm fat: and put them over the place.</start_of_turn
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summer and the place is fleshy: then you must put sponges soaked in water and fat, or in wine and fat, and all of this cold.</start_of_turn>
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the abscess, evacuate it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it has healed.</start_of_turn
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore necessary from the knowledge of the cure of apostemata universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method, indeed, of discernment, as I have said concerning every apostematum, how it is possible to achieve its cure is set out individually
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the section of apostemata which occur in the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There occur in the head small apostemata, and they are of the kind of knots which contain tunica, which are like sacks: as if they were themselves little poultry houses.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fat: and some contain moisture like mud: and some contain moisture like sweat and pus: and others like these, and there are those which are hard stones
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their section it does not make an opposite to the artery
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is as one must experience with the instrument which comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it out by the superficial section: in this way.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave anything behind it
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many return if anything remains of it
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the head in Egyptian unguent, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and apply with it a willow, and remove it until the next day
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The substance itself consumes that which remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Repeat over the substance with the aegyptio secondus, thirdus, and if it does not yield, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then indeed take care of the wound with unguentum until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the swelling contains a pimple, then dry it out in this fashion, by cutting it through in the shape of a cross: and project the nails between the two cuts, and scour it from all sides: and attempt your skill in the extraction of the membrane which contains it.</start_of_turn
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it opposes you, the artery, then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	Do the same with a stone swelling, by cutting through it, and treating it in the same way as before.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting through a stone swelling is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain hours of swellings which are in the head of certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.</start_of_turn
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I dried out the swelling in the head of a maidservant, and I found the swelling just like a solid stone, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it would burst.</start_of_turn
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other swellings of the head, except for these which happen in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision should be superficial.</start_of_turn>
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from below upwards, so as to aid the course of healing downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
Caput XLII.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Then care for it with whatever is necessary from the cure. Many of these post-traumatic swellings occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those things which happen in the neck from the above-mentioned causes, there is one, or many: and they are generated from the bone. And every swelling of the Strophula is within its own tunic, as in the nodes and the swellings of the head, as we have mentioned
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these swellings of the Strophula
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these things there are soft ones: and there are those which contain humours: and there are malignant ones which do not obey treatment
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In this way, if a good-dispositioned liquid is found in the touch, which is evident by its proximity to the colour of the skin, and which moves to every part and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, the thyroid, or the arteries, or is not deep: it must be cut away from the upper part towards the lower part of the body along a line, from below the jawline to the groin, and the two lips of the skin should be extended with a single or with multiple sutures, if necessary, as is done in the swelling of the head, and the substance should be gradually extracted.</start_of_turn>
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is important to be cautious so that no bone or nerve is injured.</start_of_turn
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the incision not be too acute, so that it does not cause you to move your hand with the incision, or frighten the patient, and cut only what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein or artery, or are forbidden by the operation, then put in the wound a lump of charcoal, or some powder which separates the blood, and bind up the wound, and let it rest until the pain subsides, and the wound is softened: or else it will begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is separated by this. Return therefore to your operation until you have completed it
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger whether anything remains of the other troches: if so, cut easily, and wash it clean.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If it is in the root of the trochee a large bone: then it is necessary that you do not cut that trochee from its root: rather it is necessary that you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls down by itself without any support.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then apply the wound to the outer side, which you have submerged in Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the trochee is cut throughout, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately, after you have washed because if it has gone too far it will not remain superfluous.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you have washed because there remains superfluous blood because of the size of the trochee, then it is necessary that you insert your finger into the root of it and extract it: and administer the suture as we said
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what is contained in the troches, moisten it with a small perforation: that you may see the seat of its maturity: and put the perforation from this which follows below the body, as we said
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation a bandage with unguent, and similar things, so that it may consume what remains of the corruption, until when you have washed the wound is clean: then take care of it with the generation of meat, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
Caput XLIII.	On the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the guttur by chance.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients say that they performed this excision of the epiglottis in the guttur, and none of them in our land ever performed it: this is the report of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In cases of spasms, however, the excision of the epiglottis must be performed: when no other remedy proves effective: for all veins and the lung are weakened by this.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hard swelling in the mouth, or gut, or two abscesses, when there is no inflammation in the channel, it is necessary to perform the excision of the epiglottis to escape from the impending destruction caused by the swelling
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore, when we wish to perform this, to cut through the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision through the thickness, in that place where there is cartilage between two circles as much as in the cartilage itself: and this is a suitable place for the incision, because it is bare of flesh and the blood vessels from it are long.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the guttur with a finger
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until it reaches the channel: there will be blood vessels if anything leaks out
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut through the cartilage as we have said: and it is known from the discharge of phlegm from it when it is ruptured, and from the cutting of the vocal cords.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let go of the wound at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the limb is moved at the hour when the focus departs, gather two lips of the wound together and sew them alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines which cause the flesh to heal, until the wound is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said it.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	This is all that Albucasis has said on this matter. The exposition is not sufficient, except when the time of the setting of the sun has passed, since the patient has already departed this life, and wishes to pass beyond this life: he will grasp towards the epiglottis in order to breathe, and will expire from the wound.  Therefore it is commanded to shut the wound until the mischief of the disease has passed, which is for three days, or almost as long as that: then indeed we shall shut the wound and treat it until it is healed
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I have seen myself: a handmaid took a knife and put it into the patient's gut, and it went through a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to care for him, and I found him foaming like a dead man.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw the wound, and I found blood which had flowed out of the wound of the little finger
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am perplexed, for neither the wound itself nor the instruments have gone awry: the wind was going out of the wound
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated him, and closed the wound, and cared for him until he was healed: and the handmaid did nothing else, except spit in the water: and she returned after a few days in better health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Henceforth, know this: there is no fear of the epiglottis in the section of the wound
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
Caput XLIIII.	On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This appendix is called the hernia of the gutturis, is a large hernia, according to the colour of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two ways: either it is natural: or it is accidental
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one there is certainly no lesion.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental, however, it is according to two ways: one of which is like a swelling of fat nodules
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is like an appendix which arises from the swelling of an artery
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is fear, and it does not seem right to assume it with iron, except in the case that it is slight: and you must prove it and investigate it with an incision.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If indeed you find it like a swelling of fat, and it is not suspected with any ulcer: then dry it up like swellings of fat are dried up: and extract it with that which contains the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with it which should be cured, until it is healed
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Of the section of the super-species of knots.
Caput XLV.	Of the section of the super-species of knots
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of knots, and I have mentioned all of them in their division: and it is necessary to say here the difference between a knot and an extrusion, when there is doubt
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that when an extrusion has become cold, and fever, and pain which are causing distress, until the ebullition of excess has subsided, and putrefaction is completed: then the fever and heat will cease
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node is not hot, neither feverish, nor painful, it contains humours that are like sacs, proper to themselves, and are according to the colour of the body: and their beginning is like millet, and they make like bataches, and are greater and less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of moisture are many, as I said in the preceding discourse
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you are performing the cure of the Node, to experience it, and to inquire about it at first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according as its form will appear in the chapter which follows.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way of inquiring afterwards, and of all Nodes, is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the apostemate: and you draw back your fingers gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally touch your hand according to the measure of the size of the apostemate.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in the stain of its wound
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever its colour be: then dry it with a superficial section, according as I said in the other apostemata.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if it does not come out running moisture in the stain of the Intromissum, then you know that it is fat: dry it therefore with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form: as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all around with ease: and keep the sac if you see it above that.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however it is broken in the sac during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole: much happens in this case, then extract it broken, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
Caput XLVI.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	If anything remains from it, little or much, it returns to Node according to most
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Experience is also found with black lead, which unites so that through them experience fistulas, whose cavities reflect like them with their smoothness.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three kinds of experience remaining
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For as from these [three kinds] are long, medium, and short, according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the tightness of its structure.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the [fistulas] is various, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For as from these [four kinds] are simple, which has one curve: and there are three kinds like liquids, great, medium, and small
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these are blind fistulas: and there are three kinds of them
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these are double fistulas having two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from these are triple fistulas having three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes, and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, for as from these are large, medium, and small
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which are cut are acute, their other extremities are not acute: and they are not put in such a way except when with these [instruments] an incision is made in the node in fear of the vessel, or the nerve: and that it may heal in peace, and that it may find tranquility after the removal of the cause of the inflammation than after its incision
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magmas, and there are three kinds of them
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are formed from air, and are similar to radium, with which alcohol is made: and at their wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in this runs inwards and outwards when desired, like liquids.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatula which are passed between the fingers at the perforation of the apostem: these are not perceived by the sick; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The form of the spatulas with which the flow of blood is broken: these are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be of air or of citrine, round in shape, of equal length, like wax: and let them be firm.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these spatulas be of three kinds: large and small: in order that you may break the blood quickly at need, and when there is no physician present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Truly, you must not use these instruments for the breaking of blood in any part of the body, and must not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds, from carnation, humors.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small instruments like the bristles of brushes are made from these instruments of a similar form: with which the blood is broken when it flows out from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made from these instruments of a round shape like this
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	And concerning the care of the breasts of women who are nursing infants
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell because of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain with a posterior wound of the nipple.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this should cut across the breast with a lunar section, according to this shape from the line A to the line B. Then scrape off the fat all around
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	After that, an olive oil is brought from the medicine of the incisions.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then two lips of the wound are closed with a suture, and it is cared for until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the nipple declines towards the lower parts, and is softened because of its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to find two points on the two upper sides of the wound, similar in shape to a half-moon, each one containing the other at the end of each, until a line greater contains a smaller one, following this shape from the line, b. to the line, g. Afterwards scrape the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning the suture and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to open the incision because of the patient’s anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to apply an olive oil soaked in vinegar to the wound and leave it, until that which remains of the fat has rotted away.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	As for the perforation of the apostemate, which happens under the title of Titillico.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemata which happen under the title of Titillico are of the kind of hard Stropharia, which contain cysts, and from these are those which contain moisture.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which are from those which contain moisture, it is necessary to cut in a lunar shape, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. and when all that is in the apostemate from the blood has been evacuated, then apply an ointment to the old wound and leave it until the next day.</start_of_turn
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the limb is raised up, and is cared for with an unguent that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the swelling should be from a kind of knot of the Strophular kind, then it is to be cut through above it, as we said in the section on the Strophulas which are equal
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, a limb swells in this way as to emit pus, then in that case apply cautery to it, as we said before
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	As for the cutting through of a swelling that has arisen from an artery or a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then many times a swelling arises from the limb: and in the same way a swelling arises from a vein, as it does in this limb from the swelling and inflation
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflation are from an artery and a vein, are these: for when the swelling is from an artery, it is long and gathered in the depth of the body: and when the swelling is from an infected limb, you feel as though there is a constriction there
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is from a vein is round in the open part of the body
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	The cutting through of such a swelling is an error, especially if it is below the armpits, and the groin, and the throat, and in many parts of the body: and it is a great danger.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary to take care of it with iron, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary to take care of it
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	As for that which is from the infection of the opening of the artery, find in the cutting through of the skin in the length
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free the latter from the tunics until it is severed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a hook under it and make it penetrate until the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, as you were taught concerning the extraction of two arteries in the temporal region.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with the sponge, until blood that is in it all comes out, and the clot is dissolved.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply a dressing which generates pus, until the ligaments fall away: afterwards care for that with suitable bandages until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there should be a clot on account of the cutting of a vein, then you must take hold of your hand as much as is possible from the clot with the skin.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a hook under the place where you held your hand, and make it penetrate: and be in it a double thread, until you pull it out from the other side.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with this the clot with a strong ligature: as I have told you concerning the ligature of a vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.</start_of_turn
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread is pulled out, then introduce another hook with another thread under the whole clot at the incision of the needle: before that, and tighten your thread in four places.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the clot in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut away the surplus of skin, and discharge what is ligated from that.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place above it a little ball which you have immersed in wine, and fat.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed.
Caput L.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Caput LI.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Then manage the treatment, which is done with licenses and unguents, until healed
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is from the parts of the body which are small: and it is from the parts of the body which grow up.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I saw a man who had two testicles in his belly, which were greater than any other things like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their labia were hanging down, and they were found to be moist from the very beginning
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I saw a man who had two testicles in his belly, which were greater than any other things like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their labia were hanging down, and they were found to be moist from the very beginning.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Many are expelled from the section of its blood: therefore if blood incites thee, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If thou seest a feeble and timid patient from an incision with iron, then take a leaden weight and suspend it from the middle, and bind it with thread: which is the way we have said, and discharge it in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add in stricture lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to bind the lead until it is separated, and it shall fall by itself without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the vessel be of great size of the root, then in its incision there is something fearful and feeble: especially that which is in the belly
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is indeed possible that thou cut through its middle
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, that it may not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound be healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful lest thou presume to cut the vessel which is of a dusky colour, little sense, and foetid aspect: for that is a cancer: and I will remind thee of cancer afterwards.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Of the care of the belly.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The belly swells from many wounds.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from incisions of the intestines which are above the belly: and it comes out through the opening, or the intestine itself, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as has been said before
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a distension of the belly itself.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a wound of the scrotum, and the opening of the tube: then the colour of the after-effect is similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the emission of the intestine, then its place is as we have mentioned, with a greater degree of variety in its appearance.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	As you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and sometimes there is a sound with it: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and great pain ensues
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is due to moisture, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither is there constriction, nor does it swell.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then it appears with these signs: the after-effect is black as night at the root of the penis
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If indeed it is due to flesh that has died: then the after-effect is thick, great, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to swelling, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in this is as you consider: if the prominence of the navel is due to the artery, or the vein, or swelling: then you must abstain from treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in this there is fear and danger, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of the after-effect due to the artery and the vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or the bladder: then you must command the patient to hold his breath, as long as he can bear it, and to remain still extending it.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the encasement around the whole circumference of the navel
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to recline between your hands upon his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then circle around with a broad spatula around the belly in the place that you have marked with a burn
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the incision upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly around with thread or silk cord: and make the knot of the ligature firm.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended middle of the incision above the ligature
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find the gut caught by the ligature: then draw out the ligature and introduce it into the finger of the index, and push the intestine inwards: and if you find a bone, then grasp it with a hook, and cut off its excess.<start-of-turn>
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, there is an artery or a vein: then circle it much.<start-of-turn>
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your work.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And grasp two needles, and introduce them through two strong threads: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the incision in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.<start-of-turn>
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the incision in four places over the needles: and if you will, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it away when it softens and putrefies.<start-of-turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary from the unguents, until he is healed.<start-of-turn>
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	And if the swelling of the belly is from flesh that has become black in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the incision, as we have said.<start-of-turn
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract blood, or moisture, as you find it in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for the place with it which solidifies the location.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	And care for the cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the discourse concerning the species of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution should be taken with it when treating it with iron, lest it should ulcerate: and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and should be treated with caution
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients say that sometimes when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh, and those that are like them, from the members that are to be excised throughout: especially when it is just beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old, and is great, it is not right to approach it closely
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I am unable to cure anyone from it: neither do I know of anyone who has been able to do so before me
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede it, and to dissolve the disease with black bile somewhat.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then draw blood from it if you find it with a swelling evident
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which it is placed with the operation
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then remove from the cancer nails which agree with it
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then draw the wound closed from every side with skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow freely, and do not bind it up quickly, but express the place, and evacuate the thick blood throughout the hand, or as much as is possible with the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, it causes blood to flow excessively from an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding ceases.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	(Sentence continues: "Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.")
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.</start_of_turn>
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall explain in this chapter the varieties of hydropses and how water accumulates: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment by physicians.</start_of_turn>
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is not except the sole kind of ascites: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympani: neither in the case of hydrops of the joints: for that is deadly.</start_of_turn
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated for this kind of hydrops of the tympani by physicians, and the treatment does not help: then consider that.</start_of_turn
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if a patient is suffering from weakness in addition to the hydrops, or if there is another illness along with the hydrops, such as consumption or solution of the intestines, and similar things: then do not treat him with iron for that is dangerous.</start_of_turn
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, the patient is of robust health, neither young nor old: then the mode of operation in this case is that you lift the patient up between your hands and squeeze out the urine from his belly downwards by pressing on his belly.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a rough sponge, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Sit two acute angles, long and acute-ended like a sponge.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Truly, within it are things of slight size which do not pass through with it until the intestines, and which leave the wound itself.
Deinde considera.	Consider it then.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of hydrosis from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend [the incision] with three fingers from the navel to the lower parts in a straight line above the pelvis.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydrosis is because of the liver: then let your incision be on the left side from the navel for three fingers
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	If it is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that it should be on the side towards which the patient wishes to vomit, so that no fluid should flow to the delicate place
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	And introduce your hand into the incision with the sponge between the skin, and scrape, as though you are scraping the wound itself: and the quantity which you scrape should be equal to the quantity of a nail, or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape the sponge until the sponge reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw out the sponge, and introduce the instrument into the hole, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or of air, or of gold, soft, thin: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides three holes, two from one side and one from the other: and its extremity is cut off, in the manner of a knife wound, like blood vessels: at its upper extremity is an armilla
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, and thus the water flows out of the water in an hour the quantity of a medium
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	If you evacuate more than is necessary from that, at a certain moment the sick man may die from the resolution of his animal spirit: or there may happen to him syncope which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Evacuate accordingly from that according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what is signified to you by the disposition of the sick man from the virtue of his pulse and from his health
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then draw out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Because it remains immediately by the skin which retains the opening which is over the siphon: of which I spoke, that you may perforate it according to the manner I have described
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the sick man can tolerate it: and also evacuate from the water the quantity that is appropriate.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this several times without fear, and be cautious: until there remains from the water little or nothing.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the sick man, and you discharge from the water a great deal: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweating in bath and sun, and expect upon the seat: and care for him with physicians of experience, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen and the liver, after the discharge of the water: as I have said before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As for the care of infants who are born in places where the bladder is not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.</start_of_turn>
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone goes out of the womb of his mother, and the head of his fetus is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to assist with the perforation of it immediately as it is born with a fine needle, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the cavity the small lead claw, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When you wish to urinate, remove the claw and let it mix together
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then withdraw it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not permit the claw to stay closed
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	The one whose opening is strict is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	In those in which the opening is not in its proper place, they are cauterized
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from the part which is born, the opening is at the end of the hair of the beard: wherefore it cannot mix forward until it lifts the hair above with its hand
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there any generation, because the sperm cannot pass to the matrix according to its right: and it is a grievous wound that is slow
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in this is that the patient rests on his back
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the hair of his beard with your left hand, and with your right hand make an incision of the head of the hair from the place of the privy, with a needle or sharp scalpel: as it is the incision of the nail, or as you would do with a radix of something, so that the middle of it comes out like the head of the hair: and that the opening be in the middle according to what is necessary
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cauterize yourself at the operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times this happens to them
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Opposition to it with that which breaks the blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	On swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the uterus, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	On swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the uterus, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many of these swellings happen in the womb, and it is the elevation of corrupted flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from these there are both malignant and non-malignant kinds
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	One must not make the malignant kind hang suspended with a fine thread, but must cut it off, until the whole thing is freed from the belly.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a soaked bandage in Egyptian unguent
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of diaphthorb until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the swelling is malignant, of dark colour, then one must administer in it cautery after making an incision of it and of itself.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the swelling is in the preparation and head of the uterus, not circumcised, and is a part of the swelling which is between the preparation and the uterus, and a part of it which is outside: then one must increase the swelling which is inside first, until it is consolidated, then care for the outside. For when you care for both at the same time, the preparation is not secured that it will not burst
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also in testicles, and black preparation and corruption
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	One must therefore remove all that is decayed and that desires to corrupt, or that is already corrupted
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then place over it after this with honey which has been consumed with pounded barley and crushed herbs of thyme.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood flow increases, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery, according to this shape.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cautery is applied to two positions simultaneously, that is, to the blood flow and the ulcer when it is ruptured
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the vein bursts and is destroyed throughout in an hour: then it is necessary to insert lead into the marrow of the bone so that the diseased part may be absorbed above the wound
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In connection with the covering of the head of the vein with the caput uirgae, and this connection does not take place except in the case where the covering is sound and not required to be excised: and when it does take place through the ulcer or swelling: it is necessary to strip away the covering with blunt forceps until the ligament is severed and the head of the vein is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern between these two, then it is necessary to strip away something from the head of the vein and from the covering
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For the covering is sometimes perforated because of its slightness or its speed.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the covering from the head of the vein with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere to each other again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then care for it with balsamic vinegar until it has solidified
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the treatment of infants, and the care for an error from an accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a continuous solution like other wounds: indeed when it is carried out by our operation, with our will, and when it is in children of their own kind, it is necessary to show in this operation a greater skill and to remove as little as possible of the surrounding area.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: for they did not use it in their practices, and there is nothing except that which we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Indeed, for I have found a greater part of surgeons to be engaged in artificial methods, such as phlebotomy and cautery, using the knife with a nail and with scissors: and they employ them for all sorts of affections, and bind with thread and suture with a needle.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I have also tried all these methods, and I have not found a better method of healing than the use of scissors and thread binding.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in the use of the knife with a nail, a great quantity of skin flees.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore it is possible that the upper skin may split, and the lower layer will be threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to split the other, and to avoid the future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the healing is done by means of the cautery, which is what the physicians use, the incision of the extremity of the limb is not secured: for perhaps it enters the opening of the canal.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in the use of the needle with a hook, perhaps the iron will go through, and will corrupt your work: and the skin of a boy is of little strength, and many are produced in this way, which does not befit healing: I therefore reject this method
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Healing by means of the knife and thread, however, has proved a good experiment to me: for the knives are proportional to the incision: therefore, as the former is greater, so also is the latter.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you have therefore grasped your hand, the two acutenesses are proportional, and they cut according to the operation of one at the same time: and it makes a similar compression of the figure, containing the skin of the member from all sides, so that no error is made at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the manner of performing the operation is thus, that you make the child understand, especially if there is one who understands fully, that you do not do this unless you bind the thread in its place: and you dismiss him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that he can, from which he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not sit down: and hide the shears in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child sees nothing of them, neither anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the wound, and blow into the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the wound comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then bind up the rest that is gathered in that cavity.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the place marked with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below it with the same thread as before
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower binding securely, and cut between the two bindings.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin up quickly and remove the head of the wound
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better thus) and put powder on it: and put a bandage over the powder on which the swollen part has been immersed in rose-water, pounded with fresh rose-water: and dismiss him until the next day: and care for the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the shears for this dressing is like this
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two handles and two blades, and the handles should not extend into the wound: and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of two thumbs together
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error often occurs in excision: because perhaps the entire intrinsic skin has escaped beyond the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary to extend the time from your hour until your nail has passed beyond the margin of the wound: and then make the incision according to the degree of equality
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the wound steady with your nail, then extract it with forceps and make the incision.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, three days have passed and what remains under the swelling has become soft, remove the dressing: then let the swelling subside, and cleanse it gently, and make the incision as before: and take care to avoid the head of the swelling.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not cause any damage to it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treat it with the care that consolidates the wound from its fragments, as we have narrated in the treatise on fragments: and if it happens that it breaks through the skin beyond the measure, and reaches the upper parts, it does not cause any damage to it even then
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treat it with the care we have mentioned, until it is healed
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Of the extraction of a retained vein in a swelling
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the swelling is caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, or similar things of that kind that we have mentioned in the section on treatment of diuresis.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	If the urine does not pass, and the retention is known to be caused by a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to lie with his knee bent over his heel
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they should place his feet on his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and grasp the painful area as tightly as possible for him
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thought therefore that when the collar of the bladder approaches the expulsion of the stone to the back: the bladder is obstructed.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not solved with this, and the disease be great: then it is necessary that you perform the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a siringa. It is formed of silver, is subtle, soft, and concave like a pennaceous quill in the smoothness of a ray, long like the palm of one hand and a half: which has a fine cannula in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The way to evacuate the bladder is through itself: take two threads and tie them at their extremities with good ligature. Insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and pierce with forceps if anything comes out through the wool. But insert into the cannula with certainty, as if lifting.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then pour oil, butter, and vinegar on the siringa: and make the patient sit over a seat, and support the bladder, and draw out the urine with oil, butter, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the urine until it reaches the root of the bladder.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then take hold of the upper part above the navel
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa into itself until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has gone to the painful area: and do not do this except when the meatus through which it passes is tortuous
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread gradually with the wool
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The bladder will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw out the urine, and make the bladder flow through the opening of the urine: and repeat the siringa, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of the bladder's irrigation with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Regarding the quality of the irrigation of the bladder with Clepshydra.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is a wound in the bladder, or when blood is frozen in it, or congealed in it into pus, and when it is distilled into water and medicines: then it is done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is blunt, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other side, like urine
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the spigot hole, where that which drives it is located, should be according to the quantity that is desired to be driven without addition, until when it is pulled with it something is taken up from the humilities: and when it is driven, when it is expelled at length: according to what the Clepshydra does which ejects oil, that is, Greek fire in battle.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When it is desired to spray moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clepshydra into the moisture and draw it with that which drives it up, the moisture is then drawn into the concavity of the Clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the urine, as we said in the syringe
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with that which drives it and immediately the moisture arrives in the bladder, as the sick person feels
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of the light bladder irrigation.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It is made of silver, or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it there is a space between which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take hold of the bladder of a sheep, and put in it the moisture which is to irrigate the bladder
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two sinuses firmly with a double thread: and heat the humidity above the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the clister into the abscess, afterwards tighten your hand over the vessel with a tight closure of humidity until the patient feels that the humidity has passed into the vessel.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the vessel is not present, then take hold of the piece of gut and make a circle of it, and pierce it through from all its roundness
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce the thread strongly through these holes, so that they resemble a twist
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, so that it is like gathering wool: after you have placed in it what you wish of humilities, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it in the instrument: and do it like that which you did with the vessel when expressing with your hand, until the humidity has passed into the vessel.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the extraction of the Lapis.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the treatise on the species of the Lapis, and its treatment with physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between the Lapis generated in the bowels and the uesica, and the signs of the latter: and we have spoken of the Lapis in which the operation is performed with the hand and the section: and the Lapis which is generated in the uesica itself: and that which appears in the abscess. And I shall speak of this with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the Lapis which is generated in the uesica, most often happens to children
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the uesica like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and the patient feels his wound swelling and throbbing, and he groans with it, and is often fainting
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and goes out with the anus in many people.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	Healing is easy for children from this point on until they are fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in youth it is middle-aged; for that which is between these two is of medium kind: and that which is greater in age, the cure is easier: and if it is slight, the care is less expensive
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary in the first place to purge the patient with a cathartic, which will evacuate all the stool which is in the intestines: for this indeed often hinders the finding of the stone during inquiry
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken with his feet, and is beaten, and moved downwards: so that the stone may go down to the bottom of the bladder, or may come out from a high place somewhat.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and your hands be under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be entirely inclined downwards
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire of him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately perform a section above it
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult male: and insert it into his rectum, and inquire of the stone, until it is under your finger: and bring it slowly to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where the incision is to be made: and command the minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and command another minister to extend the testicles of his hand to the upper part: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the sponge into the wound, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	Then introduce the sponge into the wound, which has this shape. Find in it what is between the womb and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the left hip: and let the incision be above the highest stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to issue from it not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is in the rectum will be compressed by the stone at the incision, and will issue without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that the stone has angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this [stone] is soft, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to the stone which has angles and margins, add in the fissure
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not issue thus, then you must know that you must place something above it: or that you must grasp it with a forceps with a handle like the moon, which grasps the stone and does not slip from it: or that you must introduce an instrument under it, curved at its extremities.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot do this, then enlarge the opening nearby.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything else flows out from the blood, cut it off with a saw
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then push out the big one first to the bone of the hip
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push out the small ones afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the wound is great, then ignorance is equal to the section above it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For if a sick man is seized by two things, either he will die, or he will suffer a persistent discharge of urine: because the place is not consolidated anywhere.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him an enema to expel it, until it comes out: or take hold of the fracture of it with forceps, until you have driven it out frustrated.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have finished your operation, then put on a coverlet, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and put upon it a soft dressing of oil and wine, or rose water and cold water: so that the swelling may subside
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then rest the sick man on his side, and do not relax the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have relaxed it, stitch up the place with much water, and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with rue balm, and alum, until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If indeed in the wound there is added a soft swelling, and corruption, and such like: as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and is withheld from it: and this is known from the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the clot of blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply all kinds of things which are useful for the cure, until it heals
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the cure of all these things, that you bind up two thighs, and bind together, the cause of the physicians who put things upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and lies in the bladder, and it projects into it, and prevents the discharge of urine: then care for it with that which I have mentioned before until you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	You must not evacuate from the section for this treatment, for I have proved it to be effective.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you take a perforator of iron, which is triangular at the extremities, acute, and fixed in wood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforator into the bladder with ease, until it reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator gradually from the stone: and make the perforation through it from the other side.</start_of_turn
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine will immediately cease.</start_of_turn>
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over that which remains from the stone from the exterior part of the bladder.</start_of_turn
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will itself break, and go out with the urine, and the infirm will be healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for him, because of something that hinders it: then tie a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone in the very urine between two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.</start_of_turn>
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then dissolve the ligament, and bind the frozen blood, which is in the wound.</start_of_turn>
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder: and to tie one above, except when the thread is dissolved after the evacuation of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to tie that above when you have ligated the thread below, so that you elevate the skin to the upper parts, so that the skin returns to its proper place and closes the wound, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Caput LXI.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to any of them that a stone should occur, then its treatment is difficult, and is prohibited by many methods
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: perhaps the woman is pregnant.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will confess to a physician that she has a stone when she is chaste, or out of fear of her husband
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you will not find a woman who is well-informed concerning this art, especially the operation with the hand
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place of its origin: because it demands a deep section, and there is fear in that
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do that, then you must take a woman physician, who is well-informed: and few are found
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do wish to do this beforehand, then seek out a wise physician, discreet, and present to her a skilled woman in matters concerning women, or a woman who has been trained in this art to a certain extent: make her do everything that you have learned from your inquiry concerning the stone
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that she may see if the woman is pregnant: then she must insert her finger into her belly and search for the stone
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the lower belly, and inquire about the stone after she has placed her left hand over the waist and has pressed it firmly
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If there is a stone in the bladder, it is necessary that he gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with all his power, until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should secrete above it toward the middle of the vulva toward the root of the hip bone from whichever side it is prepared for him, and he feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move from the stone, coiling under it: and let there be a small incision at first
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he introduces the radium through that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he adds to the incision according to the quantity that the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among them is the small one, and the large one, the soft one and the rough one, the long one and the round one having a branch.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kind of these, so that you may recognize them by this sign above that
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If there is blood, then add in the place of the wound a compress that has been soaked for an hour, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with the instruments that I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help with these in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If there is a flow of blood, and you know that the evacuation of blood is from the artery that was cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with fine threads: and do not move it: and let go of the stone, and do not pull it out
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When blood flow subsides after a day and the place putrefies, return to your operation until the bone has healed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	In the event of a supernumerary hernia with fluid.
Caput LXII.	Chapter XII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A swelling filled with fluid is not a hernia, except for the gathering of moisture under the white membrane covering the testicles which is called a hernia
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	When it is inside the scrotum itself, which the nature has prepared for it in part or all, until it bursts: which is the testicles themselves, and is the white membrane surrounding the testicles which we mentioned before. And this does not happen except rarely
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	The origin of this swelling is from the weakness which occurs in the testicles: from which this material flows out
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes from a blow to the testicles
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it is of a yellow-orange color, or it is a reddish-brown, or greenish-brown, or black, or white like water, and the like is more
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	The signs indicating the presence of such an accumulation of fluid are these
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if there is fluid in the white membrane which we mentioned before, then the swelling is round like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the scrotum itself, then the swelling is round with a part of the testicles exposed, and for this reason the man knows that there is another testicle
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one desires cognition of the colour of moisture, then to experience the colour of moisture in the apostemate with an introduced square, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that, therefore as it proceeds in the cavity of the introduced square, judge concerning that which is between them
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with the iron, then it is necessary to apply pressure to the patient, so that a bloodletting may be performed if possible, and to fill the body with liquid.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is rested upon its back upon a high thing, and under it are placed many cushions
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on its left side, and command the attendant, so that he may sit on its right side, who extends the arm of its left side to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, until almost to the navel: and make a cut according to the rule of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane which encompasses it: and scrape it off and observe, or cut through from this, so that you may dissect it: and let your scraping be as great as that which you can manage.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the membrane encompassing the testicles: and cut the bladder in whatever way seems possible to you, or with its entirety, or in pieces, especially its wide side superficially
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, in its incision there will be no security, as the water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, anything external proceeds from its socket in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the gut, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather up two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find anything corrupted from the black bile, then it is necessary that you bind up the wound which is the source of the bile, lest the blood flow be delayed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspension, and extract the matter: afterwards care for it as we have said.</start_of_turn
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: dry therefore the other part equally.</start_of_turn
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if you make it even, as for a single operation, then do so: then drain the blood.</start_of_turn
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections a soaked lamb's wool in fat, or in rose oil: and put outside the wool another lamb's wool which you have submerged in wine and fat, and expand between the two testicles, and see the belly: and put above them doubled cloths, and are nails: and bind them up above with a ligament, which is having six like this shape.</start_of_turn
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	And take away two cloths, and wash, and apply the saffron cloth, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are carried out from the socket, or wet wool: and gather them with the tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks: and one extremity shall take over upon a buttock until the back, and the second shall take over at the part of the groin: and two extremities upon two lower thighs, and two extremities else upon two buttocks, and gather the whole tightening in the lumbar region of the flanks.</start_of_turn
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when it is necessary to treat these swellings artificially with the cautery in the place of incision with the iron: take the cautery with a fine handle and cauterise the skin of the testicles. When the fat surrounding the testicle has been consumed as much as it can be: then take the cautery once more, this time in the manner we have described.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	And when it is necessary to treat these swellings artificially with the cautery in the place of incision with the iron: take the cautery with a fine handle and cauterise the skin of the testicles. When the fat surrounding the testicle has been consumed as much as it can be: then take the cautery once more, this time in the manner we have described.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	When the fat surrounding the testicle has been consumed as much as it can be: then take the cautery once more, this time in the manner we have described
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	When the fat surrounding the testicle has been consumed as much as it can be: then take the cautery once more, this time in the manner we have described.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	Take care not to touch the tissue with the flame.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	You know that this operation is safer and more reliable than incision, and brings about a better result
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, you should find resistance to the operation at the time of incision, or afterwards when the cautery is applied, or there is bleeding or some other complication: then you must cure the cause of the complication in the way which is appropriate to it, as has been explained before
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect to survive this operation because of its horror: then administer perforation as I have described above: and this is sufficient
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have confirmed that the swelling is aqueous as we have said: then you must make the patient sit up on an elevated seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until water flows out completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a compress above the place, and bind it tightly, and let it drain out the remaining water: then care for it until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however resistance to the outflow of water exists in the hour when you perforate it: and this does not happen except for the white plug that opposes the exit of water through the wound, and hinders its outflow: then it is necessary that you introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humour is extracted, whose form has gone before: or that you add in the operation of the wound a little of the aforementioned.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.</start_of_turn>

Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its salt is seen to be discharged from it.</start_of_turn
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall the operation in this very matter, and the kind of abscess.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many abscesses happen in bodies, from which testicles are composed: and this happens from a wound of many kinds, namely.</start_of_turn
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Whether from acute swelling or from acridness, which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from impact.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And it is pale according to the colour of the body, and is not painful: and is a grave swelling.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone swelling, whose colour is dark, and there is no sensation in it
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is from the swelling of arteries, and the swelling of the veins: thus is its memory recalled: or from the swelling of the veins
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which, therefore, is from the swelling of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the swelling, when you press it with your fingers
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it immediately.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is from the swelling of the veins, does not disperse from this by pressing with the fingers
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that above this kind of swelling there should be an incision, and above the rest of the flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then spread out the palm of your hand upwards, and pull out the swelling with white silk: and liberate the swelling from the tissues, and ligate the vessel: and cut through the swelling after you have freed it from all parts of it.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If indeed the swelling is consolidated with those natural parts of the body, then it is necessary to grasp the swelling and cut it through
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something of the substance of the veins, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and to make a round incision
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	And if there is a natural protrusion of the flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through all of that, and pull out the swelling, as we have said
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the operation is finished, take a walnut and infuse it into the lancet that is filled with fat, and mix it with wine. Then care for the patient with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Take care of the incision, which is with the vite.
Caput LXIIII.	The head of the book is LXIIII
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A swelling is a swelling that has infiltrated the quadam, similar to a bag of beans, with softening of the testicles: and it makes it difficult for the infirm to move and exercise, and to walk
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this swelling is fear, because of which there is recollection.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we must say that the operation in this case must be as the first ones did
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that you must make the infirm sit on a raised seat
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the swelling of the testicles downwards
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and hold them with another person, and extend them with an extension of the hands
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp knife with a transverse section in the direct line of the veins, until the veins are detected
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from all parts, as we said to you in the extraction of the arteries when they are in their time
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in place a sponge in which there is a double thread, and bind it in the first place where the veins are found: and bind it again at the end of them
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the humours of rotten faeces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the one with the ailment along with the care of the remaining ailments, in which is the desire to generate health, so that the masses that feed one testicle fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	There is no evil in that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, the masses fall upon all the masses, then it is necessary to remove the testicles along with the masses: so that they do not be denied nourishment by incision, and that they be destroyed, or that they be damaged, and not be in agreement with them

Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this ailment is from the section which occurs in the large intestine above the belly in the groin from the wonder of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siph or from the extension of it
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of ailments occur from many wounds: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or an elevation of a heavy thing, and the like
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the siph.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which gradually happens in a long time, and does not happen immediately: and is equal swelling all around: because the siph compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of the siph, because it makes the pain that immediately arises from the beginning: and is diverse swelling, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the siph
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine raw: and this is called intestinal rupture, and bursting: and when it is with vomiting.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When the stool runs into the intestine and remains there, it brings about the suffering of the patient. For it makes the pain of the buttocks grow worse, especially when it is expelled.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	In the treatment of this disease there is fear of the iron: therefore it is necessary to avoid this situation.</start_of_turn>
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of operation is to expel the main part of the patient's intestine into the concave part of the belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it is placed over the hump of the belly between the hands and the flanks are elevated.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then the skin following the skin to the upper part is stretched out, and the skin of the testicles is completely dried along its length.</start_of_turn
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then two stitches are made at the two corners of the wound, according to what is necessary to open the part with the least amount of damage: and the cutting should be as little as possible, so that it may be expelled from it easily.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then the fat and what is under the skin of the testicles is excoriated until the white fat is detected, hard from all parts: then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white fat which is under the skin and the fat which is below, and alongside that which is in the back part of the testicle.</start_of_turn
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand the fat inwards towards the skin of the testicles: and with this stretch the white fat upwards, with the left hand: and elevate the testicles with the fat until the part which was cut is reached: and order the minister to stretch the testicles upwards: and you will have solved the adhesion which is at the complete solution.</start_of_turn
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And look with your fingers, that there is nothing left in the white fat or hard fat.</start_of_turn

If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	If, however, you find something from there: then drive it downwards into the lower belly
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In the cavity of the rectum, no one has ever dared to perform an operation with an iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	Indeed, the first ones said that it is like what we have told you about the rectum which is with the veins.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as the veins are ligated below the section above, and dried in the middle, and the operation is completed by opening it up to the end, until the veins have fallen away: and the cautery is applied, as we have already said, until the wound has healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the disruption which takes place in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture takes place in the groin, as we have already said, and the place protrudes, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is a little and returns in every hour: however if it is prolonged with this time, an opening is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin as we have already said
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the groin is stretched: then it is softened, and the place is protruded, and the bulge emerges
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cautery, as we have already said.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is treated with an iron, in this way: and the patient lies down on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture after it has protruded and emerged, by cutting across the width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then ligate the veins which are under the skin, until the groin is white, which is under the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then grasp the radium and place it over the prominent place from the sac, and press it down into the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then two prominent places will be seen on the extremity of the radium from the sac, and join them with a suture one with the other: then draw out the extremity of the radium.</start_of_turn>
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut through the sac entirely, neither tear any membrane, neither anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then take care of the wound.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have cut the suture, bind it up and restore the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Do not make the wound tense, and do not add prominence to the rupture.</start_of_turn
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the vein.</start_of_turn>
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.</start_of_turn
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is softened in many people, because the flesh which is between them is softened, and its aspect is improved.</start_of_turn
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is being treated for this to make the patient lie down on his back, and to cut away the softened skin over the natural skin.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, remove the excess of softened skin by three or four sutures, and fix the suture.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the stitches will fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the stitches will fall out.
Caput LXIX.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the stitches will fall out.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for that reason I will not mention it in this book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two cases.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Except that in the science of medicine, when it is asked about it, and to know its cure when it happens to someone
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other case is that we often do not need castration of some animals, because of our love for them, such as horses, gazelles, and goats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and section
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the former method, the operation is to make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and become limp, and hang down: then grasp the testicles with your hand and pull them out until they are resolved and no longer appear under the touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by incision and section, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly, and grasp the skin of the testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then ligate the suspension, and dry over the whole of the incision a single time, until two holes appear: then cut through them after you have scraped away the surrounding tissue. Do not let anything except for the fine blood clot remain on them
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that by attrition: because attrition sometimes leaves something behind in the testicles which the animal dislikes during coitus
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Caput LXX.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds because it appears in the place where the space is between the scrotum and the testicles, where there is a figure like a female vulva, which has hair, and from which urine sometimes runs out from the scrotum.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	Then care for the wound until it heals. For a hermaphrodite is like two wounds because it appears in the place where the space is between the scrotum and the testicles, where there is a figure like a female vulva, which has hair, and from which urine sometimes runs out from the scrotum. In women, however, there is one kind, which is like a female vulva placed over the testicles like small testicles altogether, protruding outwards: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of three kinds, two of which are from the males, and one from the females, is this: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of these has fled.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	Then care for the wound until it heals. But as for the second kind of wound from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum, there is no operation, nor any care for it
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Caput LXXI.	Then care for the wound until it heals
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A tentule perhaps is added over the natural thing, until it is eaten away and its aspect is spoiled: and when it is grown in some women so much, until it expands like in the males, and persists until coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore that you tighten the superflous Tentiginis with one finger, or with two, and cut: and do not stop cutting until you have reached the root, especially in deep incisions, lest there should occur a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it has healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The carbuncle is a wound which is born in the orifice of the matrix, until it has filled itself up: and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the fashion of a tail: and because of this some call it a carbuncle of the tail
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that we cut like we cut the Tentiginis, and care for the wound, until it has healed
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	As for the care of the wound of a woman which is not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The alratica is like a wound of a woman which is not pierced, or like a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from a wound which preceded it: and this is either born from flesh added to it, or from fine pus, or from a spiss, and it is either in the deep of the matrix, or in its flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coition and conception, and delivery, and perhaps hinders menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if there is an apparent prolapse nearby
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If not, then inquire with your fingers, or with an X-ray
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the prolapse is from fine pus, and is close to two teeth: then restrain it, and break it
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you put over two lips the little cushions.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her back against her thighs spread wide open.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the soft tissue is broken and the hair is opened up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take the sponge, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and the woman should keep it moist every day, so that it does not harden in another place
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the soft tissue is thick and tough: then it is necessary that you cut it out with a blunt knife like the edge of a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the hair has sprung from the flesh: then suspend the oil with the nails, and cut it: and be with physicians who can stop the flow of blood without causing a wound, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with alum or white of egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then give a wide lead pencil made of lead, so that it does not adhere to the wound too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give a decoction of dry rue, then care for the rest of the cure, until it is healed
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this method: while there is no cancerous tumor that is in the womb, do not make opposition to iron in any way whatsoever
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	With regard to the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in women's buttocks
Caput LXXIII.	(The remaining text is not included in the request.)
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed a bursting of the veins, because there is much blood flowing from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When many are affected with hemorrhoids, they become little ones: and I have already spoken of the kinds of these and their signs: and I will now tell you what they receive for treatment and what they do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say then, that those hemorrhoids which are in the rectum and are not visible to the sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those, however, which are in the rectum above which the sense falls, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you put the woman in a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the little ones with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the wounds with some of the powder from one incision without causing any damage: like acacia, and the blood of a dragon, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then compel her feet to the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water afterwards
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg seeds, and barley, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is thereby detached with it, that is good: and if not, make them adhere to the swelling, and blisters, without scarification
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in pitch juice, or in pomegranate juice, or in the juice of elderberry leaves, that is, aglanter, pontico wine, and make them adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the limb is quiet after the incision, then care for the place with unguents until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	When the limb is quiet after the incision, then care for the place with unguents until it heals.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, as I have said before, and care for the place, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There are many kinds of abscesses which occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and tumours, and carbuncles, and herpes, and haemorrhoids, and fistula, and thelia, and abscesses which are cold to the touch
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I will say concerning all these ailments and their kinds, their signs and their treatments in general: it is necessary to speak of the cold abscess which occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses which join health, and how it is opened with a knife
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to consider it
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When the pain of the abscess is acute at its beginning, with percussion, flame and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls outside of its sense, do not attempt to perforate it: care for it with something which will promote its maturation, until the acute pain has subsided
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	When it is necessary to make her sit on a chair which supports two chairs, and to recline, or to place her on her back, and to bring her feet down to the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her armpits, and bind both her ligaments conveniently to that
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the obstetrix sit at the right side and handle the instrument which opens the opening of the uterus.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in the shapes which are after it
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you are about to handle this instrument, so that the liver rests upon the Radio of the deep matrix of the woman: so that there is not that which enters through the instrument more than that which is deep in the matrix, and that harms the lower part.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is thicker than the depth, then it is necessary to put sponges upon the covering of the deep matrix: in order that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix be obstructed: and it is necessary to put a sponge, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to rotate the minister of the sponge, until the depth of the matrix is opened
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the Exitura appears, and it is grasped by the hand, and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary to cut it off at its head with a broad spatula.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to put into the wound a piece of lint submerged in saffron oil: or in olive oil, in which there is some astringency: and put on the lint, and draw out the section from the depth of the matrix.</start_of_turn>
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put externally upon the matrix, and upon the abdomen wool soaked in water, in which are bad blood clots.</start_of_turn>
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then care after two days with an unguent that agrees with it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the wound are washed, it is to be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which is the radix of lily, or long aristolochia: then return to the unguent.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a vein is hidden deep within the matrix, it is necessary to prohibit treatment with iron, and indeed to treat it with that which we mentioned in the discourse.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	How a doctor should treat fetuses which emerge in an unnatural form from their mothers' wombs.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter Lxx.</start_of_turn>
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	An Obstetrician must first recognise the natural form of childbirth.</start_of_turn>
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	When a woman is in labour and she desires to smell the air and moves her head above what is above her, and makes haste to bring forth the child: then you know that this birth is of a natural form, and that the head comes forth first, and the second after.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to grasp the uterus, so that the fetus may descend more quickly.</start_of_turn
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when the head comes down, the second part also comes down with it, and they go out with these excessive movements in a good delivery.</start_of_turn
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is outside of this delivery is unnatural and harmful.</start_of_turn
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out on his feet, and his body comes out before his head, and his feet and hands together, or one of his feet: or his head and hand together: or his belly comes out: and perhaps he turns over his neck, and is similar to those figures which are harmful.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to avoid error and miscarriage: and I show you all the figures and the wit which is in them, and I signify it by this, and I stand over it.</start_of_turn
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from its head during its natural delivery and grasps the woman, and its delivery becomes difficult for her, and the man's power is slackened: then let the man sit down, or the women hold the man: and let them vaporize the woman's breath with fumigation of incense and with oily unguents.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the obstetrician inserts his fingers between the fetus's toes and finds the navel, and cuts it with his nail, until it runs clear of the moisture: and he presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary to cause the woman to strain with a suppository of incense, with poppy seeds.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to strain after the suppository: and let her clench her abdomen with concentration, and grasp her teeth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge at the first, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in delivery, then let the woman sit down, and lift her feet above her head: then sit down on the earth: and the woman shall be held, that she may not fall from the shock
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, however, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut off the hands, and extract the fetus: and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will emerge by itself
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the fetus from its feet
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges from its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards straighten it out.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he shall grasp one foot of it and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they are gone up to the hips, then command him to bend, so that he may be compressed, and make him draw in: they will go out again, if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if they do not go out with that, then gradually reduce the foot, until you have set it according to the natural form
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will go out of itself when its time comes.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is opposed by all this, then take hold of the upper part of the wound with the thumb and index finger, and with the other hand take a sponge dipped in oil and gum Arabic: and strike all over the wound with a good blow: then lay over it the palm of the woman's hand, and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make him sit in warm water, until the hypocondria follows
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When the lower parts are relaxed by the warmth, then make him drink a mixture of myrrh: and put him to bed.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When an hour has passed, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him draw in: and bind his jaw and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with ease
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the foot will go out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The foot comes out over the knee and hand.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then put your hand in slowly
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies down on his neck, and hangs his feet down: and she herself lies down on the bed, and puts her hands together
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then first above the belly of it slowly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then withdraw that which is under its feet from the heel, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then grasp its feet and move them by movement of the hand
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then first above the navel slowly, until the fetus ascends to the upper part
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hand inside, and stabilize the fetus slowly: and command the woman to compress, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus comes out lying sideways from the hands
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is finished with the reduction of its hand
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however it is not possible to reduce it, then elevate the woman, and make her walk
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is indeed unable to walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and strike her thighs with the hand of the other hand
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the unguents which you prepared from the mucilage.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she bears a part, then make her sit on a seat
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then stay in the reduction of the hand, and stabilize the fetus according to the natural figure: and command the woman to compress, and tell her to breathe, until it comes out
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out over its collar, with its hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of the mother
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the foot of the fetus, then slowly turn it around, and stabilize it with ease
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is thus stabilized, then place over its vulva what we have mentioned of the wax and mucilage
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make him sit down on a chair, and command him to lean to his right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command him to breathe: and make him clench his abdomen with his hand
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is prepared on the right side
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended to the birth opening in this way with the second hand, then cut the second one with your nail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended on the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain and die
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you place your hand according to what is necessary: and command the woman to compress herself slightly: I myself will come out through the easy way.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born: and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	This is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five or more is a thing beyond nature, and does not endure: and it contains these [fetuses] which, although multiplied, are one: and they are separated by the navel cord of each of them
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through a natural birth: easily: and sometimes they come out through an unnatural birth, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If there are any difficulties with some of them at the birth, and they arrive at that which we have mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let the midwife be gentle, and do what she does with ease and delay, and adapt to every figure as she is prepared for it from the ingenuity guiding her to safety
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that its formation is in the womb from embryos, and it is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When it is formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and many ten: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them being formed
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Since it is established by the measurement of a glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this must be known in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to the like of this: let it be opposed to that which must be opposed to it.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with medicine as I have said in the discourse, and it does not go out, and you must do it by operation with the hands, then you must consider
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a healthy woman is virtuous, and there is no other cause for fear of loss of life: then you must cause the woman to lie down over the bed, over her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs be raised: and the minister should hold the patient firm from two parts, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matricis with oily things with high mucilage, with alum, and poppy seed meal.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the Obstetrician wet his hand with these things and oils: then he will introduce it into the womb with ease
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then seek the place where the nails of the fetus are fixed, and the convenient place for it
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore at all times, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon his head: then fix the hooks in his eyes, or in his neck, or in his mouth, or in his palate, or under his beard, or in his armpits, or in the nearby parts of his ribs, and under his navel.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If he has descended upon his feet, then in the flanks and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand: and place the curvature of his hand in that which is between the left thumb and little finger: and introduce it with the thumb with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we mentioned until it reaches the desired thing
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix the other or the third hook, if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not incline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend the extension equally, and do not let it extend only according to the rule of the straight line, but move it to all parts, so as to alleviate his exit: just as it is done with a tooth when extracting it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary at that point to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	Which if it is retained from that part, then it is necessary for the obstetrician to grasp some of his fingers with his thumb and introduce them from the side, so that he may rotate with what is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore his part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore his hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its adhesion: then it is necessary to cover over his hand with the palm of the hand
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract the thumb when it goes out, either at the joint of the thumb and the palm, or in the cubit: and so it should be done in the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there is a constriction in its exit, or if there is water in its head: then it should be introduced between the fingers of Spatumile spinosum, and find with it the head, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise do this if the fetus is of great head size: then it should be severed with the clamp: or extract it with the hook, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head comes out, and is caught at the collar: then it is found, until the humidity which is in the chest is discharged
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become complicated, neither obeys the exit: then cut off the head roughly, as much as possible for you
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If however the lower belly is apostemated, or there is water in it: then it should be perforated, until the humidity comes out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is above his feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction to the maternal bone is smooth
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted in the belly, or the chest: then it should be extracted with the cloth which you have covered over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until it comes out naturally
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the rest of the limbs are delivered, and the head returns: then the Obstetrix puts in his left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If any opening is found in the matrix, then the hand is introduced into the depth of the matrix, and it grasps with the head, and pulls it until it reaches the os of the matrix. Then one or two hooks are introduced into it, and it is pulled with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the os of the matrix is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to toil over it, rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of moist things, fats: and administer plasters. And sit in the waters that soften and moisten them.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then the thing which we said concerning the fetus above is administered for it
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then a perforation is made carelessly, and it is extracted
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything escape from the second part altogether.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning the cold clots which happen in the matrixes.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flows, then descend into the styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whom there was a dead fetus: then it was impregnated over her again with oil, afterwards the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happened to her after a long time that a clot formed in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and pus began to emit from it.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and it did not consolidate.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed over it some strong-adhesive plaster: and it came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by, and another bone was discharged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am amazed at this, for there is no bone within.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I think therefore, because there were dead bones of a fetus within.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I asked the woman, and she extracted many bones from me, which were in a better position: and I did so without pain for a long time, and I sent out a little pus from that place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not touch this foreign thing, except that there is knowledge in it, and help for that which the skilled physician gives with his hands from the art of healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of the necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which the books are equaled, having two rings equally distant at the extremities of two sticks.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Indeed these rings must be subtler than the strictor: and that they may be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like a single finger, and the length of each of them is from the wrist to the middle of the palm: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additional pieces of the same kind of wood, which are fastened in both, whose length is half the palm and a little less: and the width of each is like two fingers, or less
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate the two rings.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the ring which opens the matrix
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form like that, subtler and smoother.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Made from ebony wood or horn, according to the shape of the forceps.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Indeed, at its extremities there are two appendages, as here above: and the length of each appendage is like the palm of the hand, and the width of each is like two fingers.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with this, then make her sit over a lectum, with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two appendages joined together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity of the opening of the matrix, until the Obstetrix wishes to stop.</start_of_turn
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another kind of Vertigo is called "Impelling Force" by the ancient writers.</start_of_turn
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The "Almisdac" form, by which the great head is countered: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the extremities, like the hooks.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is oblunged, like the forceps in this form, like the hooks, which have teeth like those of a saw, with which it incides and counters.</start_of_turn
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The "Almisdac" form by which the small head is countered.</start_of_turn
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The surrounding form which has one spine.</start_of_turn
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The surrounding form which has two spines.</start_of_turn
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The forceps form which has teeth like those of a saw, with which the fetus's head is countered.</start_of_turn
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the Spatumilis has two extremities to abscind the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilis also has two extremities.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more numerous the kinds of them are that are prepared by the artificer, the faster will be the operation and the greater will be its effect on men, on account of their quantity
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	There is no need to despise any of these instruments, for they are all prepared for you
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is not unreasonable to expect these things of them
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the Second
Caput LXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Second is retained in the part, then it is necessary to grasp the lower part, in order to retain the breath
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make the incision with the forceps: and grasp the hand over his jaw, and take hold of his breath.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If he comes out through this, that is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then grasp his head, and pierce in the middle of the cheek: and place in it herbs that open the bone like fennel, rue, and plantain, and chamomile, and hyssop, and cassia twig, and centaury: grasp all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a poultice of reeds over the hole of the cheek and the other extremity in the bone of the matrix: and hold it until the vapor has reached the depth of the matrix
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make the incision as we have said before
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The Second will come out easily
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, after this treatment, the patient remains and does not depart: then command the Obstetrician to immerse his hand in pure sesame oil, or in high mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then plunge it into the belly, and seek with it the Second [i.e., the uterus].
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When it has grasped it, then take hold of it, and extend it little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, the appendix be in the depth of the belly, then plunge the hand in, as we have mentioned, until it grasps the Second [i.e., the uterus], and draw it out little by little along the straight line, so that the belly does not tear from excessive tension: it is necessary therefore to mix [the procedure] with facilitating movements towards the right and left: and afterwards add in the quantity of tension.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will then obey, and be restored, and depart from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	As for the os of the belly being closed [i.e., contracted], as we have mentioned: care for it with sternutation, and from an oil medication with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not depart with all that we have mentioned: then beware lest you tire yourself out in the course of the extraction process.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true that it should depart from the os of the belly to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema with four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	This will cause the belly to soften after a few days, and dissolve, and depart
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed when it has putrefied, it will emit a foul smell from the belly and head, and will cause pain which will make the patient weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient experts are experienced in fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the second [menstrual] blood and the period.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be like a cauldron, or a jar: and put the wide end over the flame: and let the fumigation rest on the berries: hold it there until the fumigation is consumed: and do it again another time
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the care of an unpierced animal
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their nails unpierced, whom I have seen to have been oiled with subtle saffron.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that nail with her finger: and if not, pierce it with the pointed Spatumili: and beware tears, lest it touch him
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put upon it infused wool in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the nails, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If indeed it is to be oiled, then put in the hole a lead cannula for many days, and take it away when the boy wants to urinate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And indeed the oiling of an animal may also be from the consolidation of the wound, or after-effect.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be dried, then care for it as we said before concerning the care and lead
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the care of fistulas which happen in the lower part
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which happen in the lower part are Nodulation and Swelling which happen near any limb: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or more
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the old Nodatio is relaxed, it opens and white watery moisture or subtle pus issues from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	Or when there are penetrating fistulas from them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	They are recognized by that which comes out with the discharge and by swelling, when the patient is in pain: and perhaps comes out with worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	There are fistulas when they extend from the penetrating area to the cavity or to the muscle of the belly
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And from the penetrating area to the hip joint, and to the knot of the tailbone
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this, however, it is recognized that the penetrating fistula is known until it reaches the anus, even if it is not penetrating, as when you insert your finger into the anus: and you insert a needle sub-externally into the fistula from outside.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then introduce in the gut a lead needle or a hair from a horse's tail until you feel the needle or hair, or until the hair comes out on your finger
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the needle itself, neither that anything comes out with the discharge, neither swelling, neither worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: take care of the cure then.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	When the fistula is penetrating until the cavity or the bladder muscle: then its meaning is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this so that the place may be consolidated with the physicians.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	When it is penetrating until the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the attempt reaches up to this point, if there is no twist up to the bone: and a sensation of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that there is no benefit in it from the medication, neither is it consolidated with oil
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In these penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure: the cure is toil and perseverance from the stupid doctors who form them.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In these non-penetrating and non-ancient fistulas, healing is expected with a clamp: as I have said before, and as I have proved: let the patient lie between your hands over his belly: elevate his limbs until above his knees, and let his knees bend towards his belly
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air into the fistula, if there is a tortuousness in the fistula, until you know where it ends.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels around the belly, then you must introduce your finger into the belly.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger that it is attempting to penetrate through the recognized area, except for what you feel between your finger and the flesh, or carrion: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: there is no work in this, because it is not its cure, as we have said
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some people, the cure is in the flesh itself, and from the medicine which is expected to be applied: thus you should apply gentle cautery under the breadth of the fistula, as has been said before, and introduce the flame itself into the fistula until it disappears from around the belly
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do this twice or thrice, until you know that all the fatty flesh which is similar to the veins of a bird's wing has been consumed by the filter.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with buttered bandages until those fatty tissues have gone: then care for it with unguents that generate flesh and consolidate.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it heals well, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	If not, it does not recover with any other treatment at all.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If not, it does not recover even if you take away the finger that is in the groin and that is between the thumb and the fleshy swelling from the bone, or if you lance it: and you should know that if you do this, dry the skin from the start of the fistula, and take away the fleshy swelling with the thumb that is in the fistula, until the drying out reaches the end of the swelling, and the fleshy swelling is freed.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then wash the surrounding flesh thoroughly, so that no pus remains from the cannula of feathers of birds.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, blood flows and mixes with you and the operation, so that you must cut through the flesh: then it is better that you cauterize with fire or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For indeed, cauterization with fire unites the good habits, brings together the added flesh, and stops bleeding, and dries up moisture
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with cloths dipped in butter, or with bruised grapes, until the place discharges pus, and the added flesh is expelled in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for it with solid bandages, containing substances that promote the formation of tough flesh: and these are medicines that have stypticity and drying qualities.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is healed, then it is cured: and not by doing it repeatedly.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, the fistula has persisted to the depth of the abdomen, and has become prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the abdomen and inquire about it
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel the fleshy swelling and between you and the fistula is close to penetration: then there is no operation in this case, except according to the degree of trust and hope
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Whatever is done by one of three methods: either by cauterizing it as we have said; or by dissecting it until its concavity is complete, so that one may afterwards insert instruments and perform the cure.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	Proceed not too far with the dissection, lest you cut through the membrane of any organ, and cause an unfavorable outcome of the evacuation without the will of the patient
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will recover: or you may stretch the membrane and cleanse it when dry, as we have said, or with hooks, or with some other sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse the excised tissues which are in the dissection, until fat remains only with the scarp.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then endeavor to restore the entire wound with the dissection, and the upper orifice where it is closed: and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier over the infirmity.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when the fistula is sutured in this way: that is, when you insert a hook into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus: then grasp the hook with the perforating extremity, which is like a needle, that is, prepared for cutting the skin, in this shape
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread of silk wound from five threads, and pass it around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the hook with the thread into the fistula, until its concavity is complete
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, however, it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus, then draw out the thread from that hole: so that you may insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the extremity of the thread, and join the two extremities together: and bind them so that neither slips, and leave it like that for one day, or two days: and the more the thread has penetrated the flesh, the better you must bind it, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two extremities of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then care for the wound, until it is consolidated and healed
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the opening of the Fistula is not penetrable: then make it so in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it be in great depth.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	Except that it be in great depth, make it so in whatever way is prepared for you
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Except that it be in great depth, make it so in whatever way is prepared for you until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the spindle which is found in the Fistula, whose curvature is acute upwards and the other part is not acute, so that it does not damage that which is not necessary, like urine.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suture of Hemorrhoids from which blood runs from the incision of them: and the care of the incisions.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are Hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	They are either inside the rectum, like pieces of charcoal or prunes, or they are like the seeds of the lotus
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And they are either small or large: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the rectum, and at their extremities
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the rectum are mostly small and emit yellow urine, or a slight flow of blood: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the care of those which are inside the rectum is to make the patient sit upright: and to expel, until the anus goes out, and they appear small to you
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hold it suspended with hooks: or hold it with your finger
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut it at the root of them
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not remain within the loop due to moisture of the wound and their softening: then cover them with rough cloth or a coat of lanolin from wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them out, and powder over them after cutting whatever powder you wish, so that they remain in place like cautery
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them as it is written in the chapter on cautery.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If it does not obey the anus in its evacuation, then instill a small dose of laxative in the belly where there is a bite, so that it will be evacuated quickly, when the infirmum discharges itself
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If they are outside the anus, then it is easy: grasp them with your finger or with a loop, and cut them off.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound as we have said, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever dislikes an incision with a knife, then he must administer a suture of them in this way.</start_of_turn
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread that has been wound up, and introduce it into the hollow.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the little ones upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and tie two knots of the thread at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and tighten the little one tightly.</start_of_turn
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle.</start_of_turn
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the little ones, and discharge from the wound one at a time: neither their own, lest there should be excess blood from it.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place above the wound a soaked sponge in rose-water, or vinegar, and place the sponge above the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off naturally.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When they fall off of themselves, care for them with unguents, and leave the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Of the care of wounds.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many are caused by the evacuation of stool, and the constriction of nature.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are thus diminished, and do not avail themselves of medical treatment: then it is necessary to apply mustard seeds with the thumb, or with your finger, until they are softened, and the outer layer which hinders adhesion is removed.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the wound, until it is consolidated as it should be.</start_of_turn
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the wound with greater reason than at first, until they bleed much, and are then cleansed with care, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Of the care of burns of the body, not of the wound: and of blisters, and of ants.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.</start_of_turn>
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that a burn is not anything but a round knot according to the colour of the body, like the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it occurs from pain during walking.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore to cut around the nail and hold it with forceps, or with a needle, and extirpate it from its root.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it, do so as it precedes in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	And thus there is always one prominence which is small, rough, filtered, and rounded above the surface of the body
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they are found in the hands of children many times
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its care is that you extend the prominence and break it: or bind it with a silken thread: or with hair, until it falls off
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and thus you will eradicate the reversed prominence, and not the natural one, with the instrument which I shall mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	There is also a small, filtered prominence, large, above the surface of the body, which extends downwards into the depths: and when it encounters cold, it feels like the bite of a flea, and it causes pain throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its care is that you take a needle from the wing of a bird, or a strong hair, and put it over the Flea, until the circle of the needle encompasses part of it
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the needle, until you have severed what is around the Flea: and you put it deep into the flesh, and you extract the Flea from its root
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with an air needle, or a needle of iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the needle reach the tip of the swelling, so that it alleviates the tension on the finger and its retraction
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Flea according to what is mentioned in the chapter on cauterization of the prominence
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to Clisteria in ailments of the soul, and the solution of the inner parts, and the colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered to Clisteria in ailments of the soul, and the solution of the inner parts, and the colic.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When Clistera is made from silver, or gold, or blown glass, or hammered out.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when made from these instruments, small and large, according to those which are administered
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	This is done in the treatment of young children who are feeble or painful, as well as Clisteria themselves
Clistere magnum.	A large Clistera
Cistere paruum.	A small Clistera
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The upper head of it in which the uterus is bound, be wide in this way: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is bound like water, and its lower extremity which goes into the belly, be dull, that is, not open, soft, gentle, stretching to thinness: and on one side there are two holes, and on the other side one hole
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the ribs, and less broadly, and the uterus in which the medicines are placed from the animal's urine: or from paper like the asphodel of the small one: whose root is a single palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is perforated with many holes as it is rolled about, and there is space between every hole as wide as a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into these holes a strong thread from raw thread, which be from ten threads, or about these, and bind together with it the uterus like asphodel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is thus placed in this uterus, it is strung in the head of the Clistera between two distinguishing constrictions of strength.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then cleanse the wound with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle which is here drawn, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the cleansing with it is: that you apply either a portion of earth or a medicine which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, neither too warm nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient lies on his back, and lifts his legs up towards the shoulders: and put under it fat, that is, skin which men lie upon, or linen
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then wash the limb with oil, or with alum or with mucilage of barley, or like these.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the wound with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take hold of the limb with both hands and press it with pressure, until it has evacuated everything which is in the wound into the intestines
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the Clister and lift the patient's legs to the side
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	And if the medicine orders you to leave it, then keep it as much as you can
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is most excellent in healing
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you cleanse it with the solution of vinegar and it speeds up its healing: then cleanse it again until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the year: then let the Clister be subtle and cold, soft, from the Clisters which are used to cleanse children.</start_of_turn>
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the subtle Clister which is over the strict skin.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head wounds without bone fracture.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken concerning the treatment of wounds in general, which is contained in the book. Here I will speak of the treatment of these wounds with the hand and with the aid of physicians according to their custom
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Wounds are of various kinds according to the cause of the wound and the place where the wound has fallen
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Wounds are thus of various kinds, as when caused by a stone, or by a sword or knife, or by a blow with a spear or wood or arrow, or by like things
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds which are caused in different parts of the body are also of various kinds, as for example a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the stomach, or the limb: or like those on the joints
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I will speak of the treatment of other wounds, so as to give the reason and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of the compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say thus.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider whether it is from a stone or something similar. Then break only the skin: and the wound is great and the time for the inflammation of the surrounding area is great: then proceed with care and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: do not delay this: and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue. If there is anything which prohibits phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood flowing from the wound, do not do it
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of repletion (excess), of wine, and of coarse food
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something hinders the reduction (of the wound), then let the food be diminished, not increased, and let meat and wine be avoided
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And let there be placed upon the wound if it happens to have a thick scab, a cushion of infused alum on pure salt, or with wine in which there is styptic action.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are secure from the thick scab, then let there be placed upon the wound, if there is a clot adhering to the blood, and has not altered its air, some powder which I will tell you of later: and if it has altered the air, then let there be placed upon it some unguent until it is healed
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from a wound made by a sword, and the like: and the edges do not adhere by little hairs, then let them be brought together with sutures, as I shall say concerning the sutures of these wounds
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound has been detected from a bone, and hangs loose, and its retention is not necessary except in a small suspension: then cut it off
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with physicians, and restore to it solid flesh in the place of the skin, and command the patient, that he eat coarse food, such as heads, and cooked barley, until the pulse be regular: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the wound corruption, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the corrupted part entirely, and cast it out: then care for the wound
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire concerning the artery
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If then you find the wound not closed, you must dry it with Spatumili, or bind it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said, then cauterize the wound until the blood is excised
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If the wound is small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: thus as to powder over it this powder: because it strengthens it before it changes from air
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of applying powdered gypsum.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: mix one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime: grind them all together, and make a paste: apply it to the wound, and bind it securely, until it adheres well to the wound itself and is clotted with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then string the wound over with lint, and let it go, neither wash it until it has healed, so that it does not burst open
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not driven out by medicine until it has healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it does make this calcification alone, when there is neither oil nor dragon's blood in it, it does the same operation in many great wounds when it happens that it is placed over them and bound, and when there are fresh wounds with their own blood, which have not altered from air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	When it has altered the air somewhat by any alteration, especially when it is in summer, then the intention of this powdered gypsum is not there: care for it as we have said, thus as to place over it some digestive unguent: or place over it balls of barley flour made with water and honey, until pus comes out of it
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the cure until it heals
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of head fractures.
Caput LXXXV.	Head fractures.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If indeed it happens that there is a fracture of a bone and it is small, then extract it with a grasper: and I will tell you the treatment of head fractures in this which the future is. If however the nerve of the head is cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, it is not in vain that it is fractured, except that it must be treated with something which brings about hemostasis, such as sponges and eggs, and things of that kind.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For indeed the nerves are unknown, and against them there is no remedy.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and let this be how it is cured by physicians gently, such as lime with honey or with rose oil and pitch, when it is washed even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, according to this method, and oily unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If indeed the fracture is large, then administer a suture: or close its lips with wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is deep, or has happened in a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is gathered, then perforate it in a depressed place in that place
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed a blood vessel has been cut, and its blood flow has followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and bind it: or cauterize it, if that is necessary for this.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the teeth have penetrated the guttur, either completely or partially, and the gums are swollen: then aggregate the lips of the skin with a suture above the canine tooth of the guttur, and do not touch the guttur itself, but rather equalize it with the surrounding area, and reduce it to its natural position.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a proper suture, and discharge it in a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents in which there is stickiness and exudation, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, a nail has made an imprint in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in the same, extract them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, discharge it, since the nail will putrefy and separate and the discharge will be alleviated.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	And if the nail has been embedded, then grind over it with the powder which I mentioned before.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, it is seen in the nail, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is fitting for its situation in its chapter.</start_of_turn>
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Of the nail in the palate.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.</start_of_turn>
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is percussion of a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, from the nail there escapes blood, when he breathes out from it the sick person, then you know that the nail is mortal.</start_of_turn
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If, however, it does not have great depth, and is embedded with blood: then do not immediately grind over it, or suture it, so that the blood does not remain in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the patient: but put in it a nourishing unguent, and leave it for two days.</start_of_turn
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed an unguentum is not present, then place in the opening of the wound a seasoned cushion, that it may absorb what proceeds from it from the humilities: and cause the patient to sleep upon the wound, that it may mend what accumulates in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm or bad tremor of the heart, nor bad breath, nor stricture in the bowels, and the patient's other conditions are good: then you know that the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Care for it diligently and with treatments, and with other cares, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens, then you know that a fistula has been made.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Care for it from its chapter.</start_of_turn
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the breast or back: then care for it with that which precedes from the suture, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.</start_of_turn
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if indeed it has made an impression in the bone, and has broken from it: then inquire about the wound, and properly extract that which is separated.</start_of_turn
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if indeed they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, alleviating the extraction of them.</start_of_turn
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	As for the rest of the accidents of wounds in the rest of the limbs, the judgment in their care is their own.</start_of_turn
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the issue of them.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXXVII.	Head Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption which happens from inside is great, middle, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	It is great when the intestine or the number of intestines comes out from the great one
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore there is an introversion of the bowels, and the suture is more difficult and arduous
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption is also difficult in another way
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction is more difficult if you do not properly perform the introversion back to its place immediately: because it swells, opens, and swells up: and thus the entrance of it becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, the middle disruption is better: because with this one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the two other kinds
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper for the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are other methods which are more proper for the suture of the belly: and I will narrate one of them with its exposition and declaration
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, because when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because of the inflation of the intestine due to the cold of the air
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When it is like this, then one must warm it up, so that you may immerse a sponge or a wet towel in warm water
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil them in water a little bit, and cypress, and fennel, and embroil with them the intestines, until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes that liquid in which there is stickiness: it is better than plain water in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you have thus resolved the swelling, then moisten the intestines with the water in which they have been boiled, either high or low.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For thus it alleviates its entrance with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then find in slight disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than the section: and does not cause a pressing need to cut after necessity and the fault of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be sharp and acute, and the other part not acute: and the extremity should not be fine like that of Spatumilis, but rather obtuse like a bean: and this is what resembles a wound, like the liquid
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is thus strengthened, and the intestine is introduced, then it should be brought about that there is a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: because that is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When indeed the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it should be made to lie flat on its back, and place its knees higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head, and its chest higher than its lower parts
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	It is thus necessary that the surgeons perform this work in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place this [dressing] according to what is prepared for you
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that your hands rest comfortably between your fingers, which hold the entirety of the hand together: and gather its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then draw out from it [the wound] whatever follows the suture one thing after another: and this is the manner of common suture of one
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is necessary that you take an awl, or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then withdraw from the edge of the disruption the quantity of the finger of the hand, namely the physician: and fix the awl one beyond which you enter into the skin in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of fat which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another side, and you gather together two extremities of the skin and two extremities of fat: and there are four orders thus formed
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are gathered together by a decent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then withdraw the length of the finger also, and fix in the flesh another awl: afterwards tighten the skin with the thread, as you did with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do this until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the middle awls between the length and the thickness: because the fine awls slip easily through flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: for this reason it is necessary that they be of middle thickness in the skin, and thick
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	It is not permissible that a needle should remain in two contiguous parts of the skin for a long time: for the flesh will otherwise quickly decay and a wound will open before consolidation has taken place, and will not be lengthened even when sutured, for it will be prevented from consolidating by the suture.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then pierce the extremity of the needle, so that it does not wound the patient during sleep: and place wool pads around the needle from all sides, which will hold the needle in place: and draw it out, until you know that the wound has consolidated
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this is the kind of suture which is most suitable for small wounds
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For indeed one, or two, or several needles suffice in a suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is that in which four extremities are bound together: two of the skin and two of the fat in one wound, with the needle through which the thread is passed being equal in thickness and consistency.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the thread be drawn out from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture be like the stitching of cloth. Place between every suture as much thickness as the breadth of a little finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture they know already.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I did this suture to him, the wound which had happened to him in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and was a disruption of the greater part of the intestine for two palms: and it had escaped from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I reduced it therefore after it had rested outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The swelling has subsided in the space where it remained for about fifteen days; I have treated it, and it has healed: and since then it has not returned, having become accustomed to its own condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians declared that it would not recover.</start_of_turn>
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And indeed, a miracle occurred, for I did not treat it with unguent.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where unguent was not to be found, neither did I have any from the physicians.</start_of_turn
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I placed upon the swelling a warm compress twice a day, and I bathed it with scented water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I used two kinds of sutures according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with the acute suture: and you insert the point from the exterior to the interior part.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated the skin, and has reached the abscess according to the length and breadth of the whole body: withdraw the point of the needle in the side in which you inserted the point, and make penetrate from the inside outwards at the opposite end.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus made the penetration, then make the penetration once more in the same place outwards from the outside, and withdraw the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate from the inside outwards in the opposite end: and withdraw the point which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate again from the inside outwards in the opposite end, until it has penetrated the whole abscess.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	And then begin also from this side, and tie it with the point which is outside, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the skin to that area, and its outer limit to the side which is opposite to that which has the mark: and draw out the skin from that part which is on the side of it, and make it one with this, and the other: and make this one after the other, until its outer limit is like that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of all these sutures is like the sutures of the leatherworkers which join skins: so that you make one from one side of the skin-edge: and you let go of the other from the other side, until you have completed it.</start_of_turn>
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture which Gale has spoken of.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the way in which he has spoken, that you must join all parts according to their similarity, as do some physicians, so that you join the outer limit of the skin to the outer limit which is opposite to it, and the outer limit which has the mark to the outer limit which is opposite to it.</start_of_turn>
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I have told you.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that the ligature be made in the outer limit which has the mark, close to the outside, and that you make the skin penetrate inwards only in that place: and you let go of the two skin-edges.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then draw up the ligature, and make the skin penetrate from the outside inwards through the two skin-edges, namely on both sides.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then draw up both of them, and also make them penetrate both from the inside outwards through the two outer limits, to the two other outer limits which are on the opposite side.</start_of_turn
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this way of suturing is better than the common way, and is the suture whose progress is remembered.</start_of_turn
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some have said this before Galen.</start_of_turn>
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The gut suture is corrected with two squares.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, insert in the belly two threads: and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is to you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the opposite side, following the suture that is between the layers of skin.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	You know that when the middle of the gut is ruptured: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the gut.</start_of_turn
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the healing of an ulcer is the judgment of the healing of the rest of the ulcers.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you follow an ulcer with its own blood, before it changes itself: and you reduce the intestine, and hold it, and put over it the powder of incense.</start_of_turn
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has changed the ulcer: then put over it some unguents that are in your presence, until they make pus: and the thread breaks, and consolidates the mucus, and heals.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it in the same way as the healing of the rest of the ulcers, until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if there are no remedies available, then put over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a soft tumor: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.</start_of_turn
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you must not apply other remedies to many conditions, when the ulcers are simple.</start_of_turn
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you are afraid that the ulcer communicates with the principal parts of the body in its lesion, then you must immerse fine wool in lukewarm oil, or in rose oil: and put it around the parts between the groin and the armpits.</start_of_turn
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then let him drink a cluster of wine with black vinegar and warm water: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated the intestine, and an opening has been made through it until it reaches its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is excised from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is excised from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The small intestine, however, which is called Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from the wound which occurs in it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their number, and because of the subtleness of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to the nerves
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a bone, and you see it, do you not remove it? Reduce it according to your reduction which you make of the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and is black or dark: then it is necessary to ligate it with a thread above the place which is rent in it, so that there may not be a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a bone there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and put two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so as to support above its traction, and extraction of it from the case of the bone, and emission of the pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound which occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, in certain persons, that it will be restored: because I saw one who was wounded in the belly by a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and was old: and there was made a fistula, and it went out of itself through an egestion, and there was a swelling.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I leave it until the cure is complete, until I am not compelled by his condition: neither do I cease to work until he is healed and his place is firm.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	Until his place is consolidated, I refrain from working on the patient, for fear of causing him further harm: neither do I leave him until that harm has ceased to exist.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And I remain in better conditions, eating and drinking, trusting in God, and having bathed, exercising in my diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some physicians say that when there is a wound in the intestine, even if it is small: then it is necessary to suture it in this way
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking large ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join together two lips of the wound, and place an ant between them over the two lips of the wound
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When you have put it over them, and closed its mouth, cut off its head, and bind its tail to it, and do not break it off
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this until you have done as much as the size of the wound requires
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	These heads remain joined to the intestine until the intestine is healed, and is not subject to any sharp or rough document
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible to suture the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestine of an animal, and is joined to it after it has been introduced into the knot
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And take hold of the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove a great deal of it
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then the thread in its extremity is passed through a fine loop of linen.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then pass the thread into the knot, and afterwards with it the intestine
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to disruption
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with hooks and intestine is not without risk, except according to the degree of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is large, broad, especially if it is in a graceful intestine: then there is no skill except meticulous handling, and its healing is not at all guaranteed
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding care of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or abscess when it grows old and decays, becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not heal: then it is called a fistula in every member in which it occurs.</start_of_turn>
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed a filtered node, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the shape of a wing of a bird: and for this reason they call some of them Risati, that is, wings.</start_of_turn
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes in wet weather it emits pus.</start_of_turn>
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And sometimes the humidity breaks in some hours.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this humidity is great and little, and is large and thin.</start_of_turn
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I say in general that any wound that does not heal, neither is born in this body, is not due to anything other than one of these causes.</start_of_turn
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	When one of these things is absent, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because between it and the lips there is a hard substance which hinders the natural growth of flesh, or because of the presence of many ulcers and pus, or because an ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter which issues from it is of bad quality, or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment, or because there is corruption descending in the region which is a kind of pestilence, or by a peculiarity in the region, like that which occurs in Caesaraugusta, in which there is difficult digestion of food and a delay in its healing after a wound, by nature itself: or because in that place there is but one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have mentioned all these causes and signs of them, and their treatments with physicians. It is necessary for you to write here the treatment of fistula and stone, which is done by one operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	There are fistulas which extend to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder, or the intestines, or the belly, or to some bones: or to some part of the backbone, or to some joint composed of several bones, such as the hand and foot. And there are those which arise from nearby parts of the great limb and are similar to these
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, the fistulas of this kind are caused by difficult healings and do not receive treatment, and are associated with labor and ignorance
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If however there is any fistula which does not extend to these places which I have mentioned, and if you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to reach an understanding of it, then attempt to close it by air or by iron, since the fistula follows the straight line. Ask for help with it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, in the fistula there is a twist, then investigate it with a fine lead weight.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead with its softness conforms to the body, and curves around the twist
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	When there are many holes in the fistula, it is not possible to indicate the upper part with a hook
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	It is necessary therefore to explore from the holes towards the holes.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture which fills the fistula, comes out through other holes, and runs from the holes.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire diligently in what way it is possible: whether it is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is of great or little depth: or whether the fistula is one which has many holes, and lies above all that with the sum of your strength: with your questioning of the patient and the finding of pain on compression with your hand at the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood on all these stations truly, then go on to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider at that time if the fistula is close to the surface or far from the junction, or from a nerve, an artery, a vein, or a place which I have mentioned: then dry the fistula according to what has been said before from my narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its orifice from the flesh, or pus, and like things: and care for it until it is healed
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to dissect it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then remove from it all the corrupt flesh from it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the ligature which is involved in acute medicine: and introduce it until it reaches the extent of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this with the utmost care, until the acute medicine has eaten away the whole of what remains in the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the limb with the unguents which produce healthy flesh, until it is healed
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have said before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of that: then inquire about it, and dry it as I have told you: if it does not prevent you from doing anything from the hip joint downwards, or from the elbow downwards, as we have said
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If indeed it is detected that the bone is corrupted and black: then burn it out until the corruption of it is completely removed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	Which if it does not heal, and emits pus like this: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Observe it carefully further on, and make a reason for it, and bring it to perfection with your utmost skill and care
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that the corruption is profound and distant in the body, which you have not been able to overcome
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not in your power in this matter, except to yield to the nature of things.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If indeed the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you: draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for that.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make exquisite attraction of them all, and do not emit anything from the body with your fortitude.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, it makes an emission from the humors, and there is no fear of that in the incision, or an error: then incides those humors and tissues, if there are any, and frees the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then place over it that which putrefies itself: and emit it, until it putrefies what is around the bones from the flesh and humors
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not solidify.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the section should be closed as you closed it in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And put over it, if necessary, a bandage soaked in sulfur grated with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent or any other unguents.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when they putrefy, these humors, and separate from the bones, the wound will be soothed by their separation and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is a single large bone, such as the femur or the tibia, and the like of these, and that which is corrupted from it, is great: then break it off with the utmost care, until that black and corruption is removed
Deinde restaura uulnus.	And then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, that which is corrupted in it is great, and the corruption has gone through to the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it off and open it up to the place where the corruption remains: then care for it until it solidifies
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you what happened to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and an assistant for your operation
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had moved above the middle of his body inwards, that is, from within, until it reached the leg, and there was a large swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It has been extended for a long time with an error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened, and many materials came out with it.</start_of_turn>
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that the cure was delayed, until the leg was bandaged, and many holes were made in it: which all emitted pus and moistened the body.</start_of_turn>
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	They treated him for a long time with many doctors, for two years at least, but there was no skill in their art, until I saw him and washed his leg and the things which were coming out of his holes were of great size: even all the men of the place fainted, and his colour was pale.</start_of_turn>
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	They attempted to reach one of the holes in his body, and they reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they were all communicating with each other from all parts of the leg.</start_of_turn
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I treated him accordingly, and I closed up one of the holes, until I found a piece of bone: and I found that it was corrupted: for it was rotten, putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.</start_of_turn
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw that what had been detected was prepared from the rotten bone.</start_of_turn
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I concluded that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut off and cauterized.</start_of_turn
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I cured him of it.</start_of_turn>
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I place restoration of the wound with the physicians consolidated in a spacious area.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated yet.</start_of_turn>
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and I found upon the second examination above the first detection: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that what appeared to me from that corruption also appeared from the corruption itself.</start_of_turn>
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempt to restore it.</start_of_turn
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored.</start_of_turn
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found it therefore upon the third time above all, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut through the bone round about the palm of the hand, and I extracted that with its marrow.</start_of_turn
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary for this purpose, except for the disposition of the infirmity of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because it was threatening him in every hour from the excessive evacuation of his bowels.</start_of_turn
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is thus healed whole: and was born in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned to him: and he returned to his usual activities: and did not suffer from any difficulty in walking ever after.</start_of_turn
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to support it thus: take hold of the ligament, and bind it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another ligament from a thicker thread than the first.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the ligament over the flesh which is over the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh over the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not wound the flesh.</start_of_turn
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the middle: for when you do this, it does not prevent the knife from cutting through decayed flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	The incision should be made above the corrupted area, not in its concavity, so that it does not cause further corruption of the bone: and it must not appear to the patient in its own sense, and must urge him towards its own healing process or another incision
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, the part which is corrupted must be continued with the part itself: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in part of it: then remove the flesh from all sides
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood under the lower bone.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	And then cut through from the first part where the corruption is, until the incision is continued from the other side: and let the incision be at a distance from the corruption as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the junction, cut through the corrupted junction and cut the bone where the incision is continued on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then it is not within it except by abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the sole of the foot: then things are difficult there
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire about the nature of the corruption.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape the wound, and wash it according to whatever way you are able, and with whatever ingenuity you can: when it does not cause you to go against the vein or the nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you know that the saws and knives for cutting bone are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their size, and their shape, and the degree of their sharpness, and their rarity
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherever it is necessary, one must prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	You know that these operations are very significant for their kind, requiring a specific instrument for each of them when one has a great deal of experience.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And you must know the modes of this art, the testimony of the modes of sickness: for then you will find for each of them what is suitable from instruments for all illnesses.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I shall demonstrate by examples of those which you mention, and the proof which you will experience from others.
Forma Serrae.	The Shape of the Scalpel.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The Shape of the other Scalpel
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of the other Scalpel again
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of the other Scalpel once more
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the Scalpel is made with the blade slightly offset from the center.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arc be at the upper part, its keenness from the iron: and its handle from boxwood, and make it pyramid-shaped with the offset at the center
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The Shape of Scissors for Sutures
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of these Scissors be in the shape of the head of a star: and their points according to the shape of the needles of an embroidery needle
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suffice unless, when they touch each other's heads, they break when they are forced together, or when the bone is large and broken
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The Shape of the Larger Scissors
Forma medii Rasorii.	The Shape of the Medium Scissors
Forma Rasorii lati.	The Shape of the Small Scissors
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the wound where the edges are joined together.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the wound where the edges are closely approximated.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the wound where the edges are bent outwards at the extremities
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of the wound small and slight tension
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the wound where bones are fractured
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape also of the wound large
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a wound like a saw, and the edges are like a saw: it appears in many places because of the reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the wound which agrees with the reason for its perforation by bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremities are triangular, and the edges are acute
Fit ex Indi.	Like that of India
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it is like that which must be made in respect of wounds and cuts and saw-like shapes.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the incision of the extremities, and the closure of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities become gangrenous, either by an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated the disease with medical remedies, and the disease does not yield to treatment: and you see that the disease has advanced to the cutting of the limb, which does not recover anything: then you must cut off that limb until the disease has ceased, so that the patient may be saved from the death or the bad consequence which results from the defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this must be done is when the limb is blackened, until it is consumed: for fire burns it, or it becomes gangrenous after blackening: until that gangrene is cut away throughout the body to that extent which follows the limb, and it spreads throughout the whole body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore with the incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is percussion of some of the veins: as for example of the scorpionfish, and of spiders, and of bloodworms, and of things of a like nature.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption exists, or percussion in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the other hand
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the palm, then cut off the hand from the root of the bone, and do not leave space for corruption, until it reaches the elbow of the arm
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it occurs in the forearm, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has passed, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to give something beyond this from the cure, is the amount of the antidote.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do the same with the foot, when corruption occurs in the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the joints: and if it reaches the heel of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	And if it reaches the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if the corruption has gone above the knee? Then it is not in that there is life, except for dismissal, and leaving the patient to death
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And as to the cutting off of a limb, or preserving it, it is like this, that you string the lower ligament which you wish to cut off: and string the other ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And stretch out one ligament downwards: and stretch out the other ligament upwards
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you cut away the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a spatula of a broad kind, until the whole flesh is detached
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it happens, or it returns.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Then it happens, or it returns. It is necessary to support the entire circumference of the wound with linen, and not to touch the healthy tissue: and it is added to the patient's pain, and the swelling is calmed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or place above it some powder which absorbs blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with the appropriate bandage, and care for it, until it heals
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to me in my foot, for this is what I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because in his foot there was a blackness, with a scorching which assimilates with the burning of fire: and this corruption first happened in his finger, until the whole foot was affected
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	He did this, however, when he saw the corruption increasing in the limb with its suffering, because of the pain and the scorching: and he cut off the corruption at the junction, and it healed
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And when some time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in the nail of his middle finger of his hand
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to restore the superfluousness with what I found on the hand from the physicians after the purification of his body: and the superfluousness was not recovered, and it began to advance into another finger: until the corruption reached the hand
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to amputate his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the recovery of the superfluousness: and I was also afraid of making an incision in his hand which might cause his death
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the man was very strong on the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When he had recovered from me, he returned to his home: and he came to me again because he had been hurt, and he had broken his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I do not approve of this narration, except that it is of use in this case: and that it has a signification which is to be known, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	About the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with physicians.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a swelling occurs in some limb by a fracture, and the space of the swelling is prolonged until the collection of pus has been made: then it is broken open, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is ejected, and that which remains is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a membrane which has been thinned out: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a Sinus, and is not called a Fistula, except when the space of the swelling is prolonged until it causes corruption in some part of the limb, then it is called a Fistula, or swelling
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you cut off the whole skin as it returns: and especially when it is thinned out, and is made like a membrane: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and that this will not be the last consequence of the corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with blistering: and consider it as a Sinus
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is great, and the pus which comes out of it is foetid of odor: then blister it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and alum, equal parts, mixed together: and apply them over a fire, until the medicine boils: and then bring in the fat of bees
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from this what you need: dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it with vinegar: and bind up its orifice, and give the medicine for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for several days until the sinus becomes softened, and the stench is gone.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is administered with water of cinnamon, when it is not present in this medicine: then take cinnamon of wood or of the ilex tree: and sprinkle it over water.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then rest it, and administer it with vinegar, until you are confident that the sinus is softened.</start_of_turn>
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither vinegar of cinnamon, then administer it with water and honey, to which something of ground mastic has been added.</start_of_turn
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or administer it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to soften and loosen, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.</start_of_turn
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then administer it with that which makes the flesh grow in it.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from pounded gypsum: and dissolve it with rose water and wine of vinegar: or administer it with some medicine, and anoint with others, whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.</start_of_turn
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the canula of the syringe will not pass: then widen it with a small piece of iron: or put in the cavity a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in balsamic ointment, until it is widened.</start_of_turn
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	Likewise, if the opening is large, then gather its lips together with sutures: and discharge from it the amount that enters without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	If pus flows from the opening, elevate it upwards: then dry it in the lower part which is in the same place, so that it flows downwards: for pus, when it is contained in depth, hinders the generation of flesh in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible to dry the cavity downwards, then attempt to prepare the limb by facilitating the flow of pus outwards with the preparation which is to be made.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Attempt to retain nothing of the pus in it: and take consolidating medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the edge of the wound
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the size of the wound be such as to allow communication of the entire cavity.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors directly at the opening of the cavity, widening the opening of the cavity slightly.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then stretch out from soft bands over the wound, according to the size of the opening: and place it over it in a distant position from the opening of the cavity, so as to facilitate the discharge of pus from it: and do not tighten the dressing too much, except after a few days or until one has healed
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is over the opening of the cavity should move in every hour, so that it may be discharged from what is aggregated in it from the pus: and you know that what comes out of it is much, or little, or digested, or undigested
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have done this again, consider the place of the cavity itself, whether it feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it, or whether there is swelling in it, or whether there is no swelling in it
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When the remedy has been rendered as aforesaid, and you see that the material issuing from the sinus opening has ceased, then you know that the sinus is adhered or is approaching adhesion: then you must remove it either on the first day or on the third day. And when you have removed the abscess, then you must change the dressing and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	When, however, the material issues from the sinus for a long space with a fine discharge, you must not despair of adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are people who are slow to generate flesh in their wounds, and others who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	When, however, the material issues from the sinus after many days in undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhered
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	When, however, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then physicians must join in the excision of remedies, for they make the remedies both humidy and dry: like the unguentum of aloe, which, when added in excess, has a superabundance of addition of alum.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last of all, when it is cured, it is necessary to take the unguentum of aloe and dissolve it with rose water, and apply it over the old wound equal in quantity to the substance itself
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then apply it with this, and use it on it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the same thing to this, when it is not present with the unguentum of aloe, honey, when you dissolve it, until it is digested, and use it with this.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum: all of them together, and grind them up on honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then apply on it a layer of the dressing, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey which you have boiled until it is digested: and sprinkle over it the powdered species, and put on the dressing again, and bind it over it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	When it is administered in that noble ointment, long aristolochia, lily roots of heaven, and lily flower, and barley herb, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	When it is administered with those simple substances, either singly or together, and the unguents themselves: and powdered cinnamon over honey as I have mentioned before, and use that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, the condition of the sinus persists and does not recover with this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depths: or that it makes an imprint in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat the fistula according to what has been said before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of fistula and nail fracture, and the addition of incision of the finger and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XC.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or finger, or perhaps in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it persists, and neglect of its treatment makes it swell, or when the swelling becomes inflamed, pus is emitted, until the root of the nail is corroded: and perhaps the whole nail is broken, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, whereupon there is a foul odor: and the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat it with what we have said before, and the cure does not take effect: then it is necessary to cut off the entire superfluous part that remains of the nail with a knife
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery must be hot.</start_of_turn>
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the soft parts of the nail are pressing against the meat inwards, and begin to pierce it: then it is necessary to place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that is piercing the meat, and push the nail upwards: and cut the meat easily, and place over it what remains of the meat from the burnings, corrosive, until it is all removed
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut off the bone and extract it: for it will not heal while corruption remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption spreading in a finger, then cut it at one joint, as has been previously mentioned concerning its reminder
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there should occur attrition or percussion of the nail, and there is pain in this: then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part in the first instance.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula from above downwards to the end.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard, that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for thereby you will cause increased pain and swelling of the flesh itself.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which sits there which alleviates the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	A finger which has been added which is born in the hands of men, is perhaps all flesh: and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps in that there is a nail: and some of them are born from the root of the joint, or is the nature of it in some joint of the finger
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some joint of the finger does not move: and he who is born near the articulation of the finger, perhaps moves
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is made of flesh is easily cut
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, as you would cut it at the root with a broad spatula
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	As for that one whose nature is in the root of the joint, the care for it is difficult
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Caput XCII.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then string the limb of the sickly person from the upper part of his hip down to the lower part of his knee with an outturn.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry one place, or two, or three wide sections
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw out blood from the lower part of the leg up to above, and from above bring down as bloodletting for the sick person at first
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the wound downwards: until blood has drained out as much as the amount you wish, and as much as the sickness can tolerate
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it: and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it is useful for the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is like this.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	The limb of the sickly person, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse it in a bath: or bandage it in his leg with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or perform an exercise forcibly, if there is no bath for him, until the limb is warmed up
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in the direct line of the vein section: or at the last of it near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from every side, until it appears sensible: and it is at the appearance of it that the blood turns from red to black decreases.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it has gone out of the skin, the blood is like white thread
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then put under it radium, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend the blood with a cautery, soft
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other section near that one by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrub the skin from the upper part of the nail downwards until it appears clean.</start_of_turn>
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise the limb like you did with the radix, and suspend it with another finger as you did at first.</start_of_turn>
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry the other section, or the sections more, if you wish.</start_of_turn
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it up, and cut the last section at the heel.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then withdraw the limb up to the section which is above the limb.</start_of_turn
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Do this until you have withdrawn the limb from the upper section, or from the higher sections altogether. Then cut the limb.</start_of_turn
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not obey you to withdraw and elevate: then introduce the needle with a strong thread twice, and bind the limb, and withdraw it: or introduce it under that radix: and twist your hand towards all parts until it comes out.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Take heed, lest you cut through.</start_of_turn>
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you cut through, it becomes difficult to elevate the limb afterwards, and it enters through that wound.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have therefore withdrawn the limb entirely: then place upon the wound a soaked bandage of wool or linen dipped in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist which has a loop towards the parts, and is not as we said according to the rule: then you must find upon the limb towards all parts the loop of the twist itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the thread with the hooks until the vessel has healed completely: and take care at the section above the vessel that you do not cut through it, or damage it: for it is difficult to raise or extract the vessel afterwards.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore be prudent.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The nature of the wound that will restore life to the vessel.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the closed wound
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not like the rest of wounds, neither acute at the edges, as to cut through it: but rather gross and flexible, for if it were slight, it would tear the vessel by its own softness: indeed, it should be somewhat thick.</start_of_turn>
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the leg vein.</start_of_turn>
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn>
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the calves in warm regions, like Alizegi, and in Arabia, and in dry and warm regions, few in number, for in them no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the calves.</start_of_turn
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, like that which occurs within serpents and worms, and worms which are generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the commencement of this event is inflammation in the calf.</start_of_turn
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is to be dried.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein is to be extracted from the place of drying, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When the swelling appears from that extremity, then it is necessary that you cover over the leaden weight, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a nodus, and let go of the suspended lead from the limb.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	When the swelling appears from that extremity outwards, cover it in lead and tie a knot in it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it prolongs for a long time, then cut away part of it, and cover the remainder.</start_of_turn>
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	Do not cut through the root before the whole thing has gone out.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts, and enters the flesh: and causes swelling to happen, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn>
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to draw out slowly and gradually, until it comes out entirely from its root: and nothing of it remains in the body: for in this way it goes out through the vein in some people which is as long as five palms and ten fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And I have seen it where it has come out whole from twenty palms.</start_of_turn>
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, it occurs to you at the hour of your treatment: then introduce radium into the cavity of its bone, and perforate the bone with a hole as long as the body, until the whole of that which is in it is evacuated: and administer the treatment of the place with medicines for a few days.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of the aftercare of the wound.</start_of_turn
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many outlets from every orifice, and they all go out.</start_of_turn

Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	Care for it itself, as we said before, and with what has been promised
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	It is necessary that the patient be cleansed and purified with lukewarm water, with physicians extracting harmful humors from the body.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And take care that he be guarded against foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	About the cutting over an abscess Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which occurs in some limb: then it changes from limb to limb
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have seen it happen, as I have told you
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was sick in some house.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I saw her arm and I found swelling in the armpit of the arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed I saw another swelling rise up like a worm, going up to the shoulder of her more quickly than is possible: like silver that is running from one place to another
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place and was fixed in the shoulder
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after an hour it ran through the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	And she told me that it returned throughout her whole body, as I saw
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I am amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had never seen such an ailment before like this, in this way
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have heard of many people who suffer from this pain which changes from limb to limb: and I have never seen it with my own eyes like I saw it in this woman
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not think that is the case, except insofar as a woman has been among those from whom the stones have been detected in the belly: from this therefore it appears that the sense of smell has been transposed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they do not appear according to this ratio in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, and in whom the veins are hidden
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you see that the patient feels pain in that place, and that the wound appears to him: then if it is seen by the eye, as we have said, then grasp above and below that which is quicker: and dry above that, until the enclosed moisture is driven out: and cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your eyes: then care for it with the exclusion of the body, and with that which expels the moisture, and carmine it with unguents like fennel seeds and rue seeds, and the like.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The text continues with instructions on extracting stones from the body.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XCVI.	(The book ends at this point.)</start_of_turn>
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Stones are diverse according to their species and according to the place from which they are expelled from the body.</start_of_turn>
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such: for some of them have large teeth and few: others are concave and others are convex.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three angles.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And those which have tongues.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And those which are star-shaped.</start_of_turn
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are expelled from the limbs are according to two modes.</start_of_turn
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	All members of the body are composed of primary members which are hollow, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar structures.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When any part of these members falls into any other part of the body, and signs of death appear, then it is necessary to remove that arrow from there, for death follows the wound in whatever position it is, in many circumstances
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when no such signs of illness appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then extract it, and care for the wound
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs of the brain when it is struck by an arrow, and the bone is pierced, and blood comes out from above the brain, it is because the following things happen from that: vomiting, convulsions, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, and confusion of the mind, and cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out of the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is stammered, and the voice is destroyed
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there comes out from the wound a white moisture like putty
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes out from it like the moisture of meat
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If any of these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out on its own.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow which has fallen into the heart are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow is moving like the pulse: and blood runs out of the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following that, there is cold at the extremity, cold sweat, and faintness.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know therefore that death approaches with uncertain delay.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the outflow of bloody foam from the wound: and the after-effects which follow the wound, subside, and change the colour of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And great, high-flying spirit departs: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the chest, which is in the belly: then it is near the flanks: and there is great sighing with pain, with breath coming in short gasps, and all the limbs of the arms are moved
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it comes out of the wound from undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and remains there: something of stool comes out of the wound, or urine, or intestine which has been broken
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain over the patient is stronger: then you know that it is deadly
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, like the face, neck, chest, belly, and buttocks, and the fingers, and wrist, and elbow, and shoulder, and hip, and thigh, and leg, and similar parts of the limbs move according to various positions: when it does not find the arrow in the artery or nerve: and there is no venomous arrow
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen many such arrows, so that you may know about the cure for your case.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What is this, since the arrow of care has pierced the pupil of his eye in the root of his nose?
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no mark remained in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from his eye, which had pierced him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not extract from it the point of the arrow which adhered to his wood: and it was a great arrow like those which the Turks make with lead in them, which have no ears
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed therefore, and no bad thing happened to his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the gut of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, which is the kind that has ears
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	And I found it between two ribs: and it was submerged in his gut
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I took great care of it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from his head which had pierced him in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	When thirty days had passed by and no change appeared in his condition concerning the arrow, we thought that he would not recover; and we took thought for the arrow and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad thing happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow had pierced his back, and his wound was consolidated with a bandage on his wound
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after seven years he went out of the arrow from the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And the woman whose arrow had penetrated her body, and whose wound had been consolidated by a foreign body above it, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change occurred in its position from its original arrangement, and the woman did not suffer any discomfort from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And the man whose arrow had pierced his face, and whose wound had been consolidated, and remained in its place: and he experienced no great pain; similar to these many cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the King's nose, which had pierced him in the middle of his nose, and it had inclined towards the right side below: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to treat him after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found that the wound of the arrow was very strict and wide
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I questioned him cautiously and he did not feel any pain: and even I could not find the puncture mark or any pain on his right side
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that the puncture was at the extremity of the arrow
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with a soft and adhesive plaster, confident that the wound would heal and the mark of the arrow would disappear; and indeed no other sign of the arrow remained in that place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I continued to plaster it over several days: and no accident occurred, and the wound consolidated meanwhile: and he felt the arrow inside his nose on the following day
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I placed over it a sharp and corrosive medicine which I renewed every few days until it opened: and when I cautiously removed it, I found the tip of the arrow still adhering to the wood
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then did I add in the opening of the wound for the acute physician until it became evident to us the extremity of the arrow: and it passed over with it the space of time which is approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	When the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce instruments into it, and to sew it up, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to elaborate, and I devised above it with the skill of the engineers, until I had completed above it on a certain day with forceps which I had made with my own hands, according to what would result in the shape of the head in the end of the chapter, until I had extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated and healed with perfect health: and nothing whatever was noticed of it
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: as you may learn from this and from what I have not said
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For indeed the parts of this art and the distinctions of these matters are not comprehended by narration: neither is it comprehended by this book, nor by a prudent craftsman who compares few things with many: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of all these matters when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not go out of the parts in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Except by attraction from the place from which it entered
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by turning back the other part
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or the arrow proceeding in the flesh: it is attracted and comes out
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to the outlet at the hour when it falls: then it is necessary that you discharge it for a few days, until the corruption of the flesh surrounding it has taken place: and thereby you will allay its attraction and its egressio.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	If it hangs in bone, and does not yield to you at the outlet, then you must also discharge it for a few days: and do it again every day with its attraction and motion, until it comes out entirely
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you after days, then you must perform an incision all around the arrow in the very bone with fine silk, until the arrow is fully loosened
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw out the arrow and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the head of the bone, and has penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, and appears from the diseased part some of those signs which I mentioned: then abstain from the attraction of the arrow and discharge it, until it be equal to its original state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow persists in the marrow, the putrefaction is not prolonged for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate as far as the marrow: and remains diseased for a few days, and no sign of these accidents appears: then think of the attraction of the arrow and its extraction
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed loosely, and does not yield to you in the attraction: then manage the surrounding area of the arrow as I have said: then care for the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow has vanished from its place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire about it with care
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw out the arrow with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you are unable to perform the procedure above due to the constriction of the wound or because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is neither bone nor nerve nor fat there: then find above the wound until the wound is enlarged and the arrow can be extracted.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are any ligaments which hold the flesh fixed in the bone, then release the flesh from every side by all means, by any skill you are able, and the ingenuity which you can bring to bear, if you are unable to perform the evacuation of the flesh by fracture of the bone and rotation of the ear, until it becomes loose
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twist of your hand with the forceps to all parts, until you make the wound discharge: and with the last slight tension, so that the arrow does not break, and that it is difficult for you to draw it, and for its own extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you are unable to perform it from one hour, then let it rest for a few days, until the things around it have decayed
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then do it again: for it is in vain that you do it if it causes the flow of blood. Then administer what we have said from the treatment in its chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer all your skill in every way that you can in order to perform the extraction of the arrow: and let this be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	It is necessary that you do as you pull out the arrow, that the patient be in the same position as when the arrow was in him.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because of the great pain.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do this, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	If it proceeds from the opposite side, or if anything proceeds from that towards the exterior: or it makes the extremity of the arrow bulge outwards by means of a sensation from the part of the skin which is close above, and it causes the juice to rise: dry therefore above that, and make a section according to the quantity which they take in that.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the arrow: for itself makes the evacuation easy.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If however it remains in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it for itself: then draw it out
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then do it again, until it comes out naturally.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow-shaft is in that, then push it out with that (the hand).
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the shaft has broken, and you wish to administer an impulse: then introduce an instrument with a concave surface into the cavity, so that the concavity of the instrument may touch the caudal part of the arrow: then push out the arrow with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push out the arrow with an instrument entering into itself.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow will go out by itself.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to cut away the entire piece of flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for the arrow as it deserves which is suitable for it
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the back, or the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible to cut above that: then cut above that, and burn away from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and draw out the arrow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then, if necessary, take a pulse, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the form of forceps from which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not recoil
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.

The veins under the tongue are useful for phlebotomy: for it is the cephalic vein which is useful for the affections of the gut, and of the tongue, and of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under these are arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are such that phlebotomy is usual in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of them is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pressing with the thumb alongside phlebotomy: or by lancing with oil to the point of blueness: or by cutting with a knife, and this is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is useful for cutting
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And there are wide and narrow species according to the width of the veins and the tension of them. The form of phlebotomy of the thumb is wide, like water
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening wide veins, full of blood, protruding, visible, large, and those which contain thick blood
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and greater fineness
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is suitable for phlebotomy of slender veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	It is suitable for phlebotomy of slender veins which contain thin yellow blood.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, those veins which are three in number which are called basilicae are suitable for phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because they draw blood from the swellings which are under the jaw and the throat, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist as well as for the patient, as it is above the risk of that there is an artery there
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, it goes wrong, and there is an error in the puncture of the phlebotomy, the artery will be injured, and there will be a flow of blood
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to do phlebotomy with the phlebotomist who is puncturing: but rather to do it dry like Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If it does not appear that the basilica is visible, then it is necessary to ask another one, or to ask for another branch of it: or to do the phlebotomy in another place, such as the forearm
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It is visible itself, and should be done dry with the phlebotomist like Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to do phlebotomy of the same one, then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then sign over the place with the cautery, afterwards the arm, and dry the vein with a concave incision like the phlebotomist Anesil, as we have said
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful not to touch the artery with the incision.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you go, when you tighten the ligature, the swelling in the place which you signed with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: you must therefore stop doing it
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If the blood spurts at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a child, and is thin and red: then you know that it is from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then do so promptly, and place your finger over the wide space, and then withdraw your finger.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is shed (for it is often shed excessively), then grasp the arm and let go of it: and let the patient be aware of its motion: and be over his fear.</start_of_turn>
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for a few days, until it has healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not shed, and you fear it: and there is no physician present at your moment, then cut the artery if you see it.</start_of_turn>
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities recoil, and the blood is shed.</start_of_turn
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of cork from the socket of the thumb, and find the place: grasp a middle third, and bind it over the place of the tight nail, with ligature and threads until another day.</start_of_turn
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood sheds, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it as before, remembering the location of the broken blood vessels and the flow of blood: and the cutting of the blood in various positions is not difficult because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of ligating from the arm.</start_of_turn
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the thumb.</start_of_turn>
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the thumb, however, are of phlebotomy, because they carry blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic vein, as we said.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above the fear of phlebotomy, for under it lies a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If, therefore, he adds too deeply in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, there results in this a stupor, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps does not heal completely.</start_of_turn>
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is much frequented by sensation.</start_of_turn>
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If, however, it is hidden in some people, and is thin, and is not seen: then it is necessary that you should join phlebotomy with Alnesil, and divide the nerve with your skill.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	And if there is one between two nerves, then find the one along its length.</start_of_turn
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the nerve of the head.</start_of_turn>
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies of the nerve of the head are useful, for it draws blood from the head and supplies it to the eyes.</start_of_turn
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this nerve to do so alone, if you will, with a needle like that of olive oil, or like that of myrtle: for it is safer for all the veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve under it.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But indeed it is fitting for you to join with the phlebotomy the laceration of the head, and to inquire about a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found at the first percussion, as it returns above with subsequent phlebotomies.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Perhaps indeed it is delayed in some people when it is not phlebotomized at the first percussion, but it does not harm them that.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed in its practice.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, and the accidents that arise from it, require consideration in their rectification.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, know that Phlebotomy is not to be employed except for the conservation of health, and for the preservation of life, and with caution against the hazards.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that it should be performed only on the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that it should be performed at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer, and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	It should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy for ailments has no set time: but when it is convenient and necessary for this, in the night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it should not be performed on children until they are at least fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should it be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor on the elderly who have passed their sixties years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wishes to undergo Phlebotomy for whatever reason: it is necessary to loosen his bowels beforehand with a laxative, if there is much retained stool: so that they do not draw blood from the veins with the remnants of putrid feces adhering to the principal limbs
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither should it be performed on a feverish patient, that is, one with nausea: nor on a drunkard, or one suffering from intoxication until these symptoms have passed from the body
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy suffer from hydropisi.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the phlebotomist deposits the needle.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore an opening is made from the vein of one, then that is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the process with another vein nearby under that place or above it with a twist: if the place does not recover
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	When it has recovered, or if the patient vomits, then send him away on the first or second day: and do not tighten the ligamentum
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps for that reason the swelling will be withdrawn.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither should a poultice be introduced
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or blood runs slowly: and take care that blood does not escape from the vein in too great quantity: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule and add a little more to the operation
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do it with a twist, before the place has recovered: for in many people the place is already recovered at the time of the operation itself.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the swelling has already gone, then do not repeat over it altogether, for it does not excuse you from doing something else
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something of the faeces of oil on it: because it will soothe the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than the rest of the oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with the faeces of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you do on account of the running of the blood: and make them become like tyriaca alfarach and sagzenea, when you put one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes finer and is resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	When blood is thick, it becomes finer and is resolved
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do this after the blood has been let from the vein itself, with the addition of some of its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or redness remains in the place after a day or two, or if there is any swelling, do not be afraid of this: and if you are afraid, put over it some aloe or myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or something like that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often blood clots and swellings occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand over the place, then if you feel softness under your compression, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, put over it something of what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps the blood will flow from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster of it with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is closed
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And then care for the rest with the remaining treatment until it is healed
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw out of every man from blood according to the quantity of his virtue
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color of the blood over the blood itself.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then send it away until it turns red: and in the same way if you find it thick, then send it away until it becomes fine: and in the same way if it is sharp, then send away its sharpness until it is gone
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	He who is full, strong, and in need of blood should extract one unit, so as to enlarge the vein, and let the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is bilious, let it be the opposite of him.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	He must extract in veins and the opening must be narrow: and it is better that the phlebotomy be transverse, not pointed
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	This is the safe method of phlebotomy, from the flow of blood, from nerves: and is more laudable and safer than phlebotomy through breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it has happened to faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary that before phlebotomy he be given a spoonful of honeyed water or dry toast, if he is heated: and extract from him from the blood in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is cold, then take before phlebotomy a spoonful of bread infused with honey, or in scented honey, or in scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if there is fainting during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary that he take in the pot a little meat broth and a mild aromatic syrup: and let it be flavored with fennel and mint, and let the patient lie down with these things: and let us do all that we have said in the chapter on fainting from evacuation
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But if he wants to evacuate his arm and solve his blood quickly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation, and whose temperament is bilious, to solve the blood gradually in the quantity of his temperament in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	He who wants to evacuate his arm and solve his blood quickly, and whose body is strong: let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs downwards: it must be done on the second or third day
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And what is the quality of phlebotomy, that it may introduce the patient's hand into warm water, until the wound is red, and the joint appears to swell outwards.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over itself with a bandage of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomy is performed in a transverse direction gradually, not laterally, neither in length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be as near to the wrist as possible
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood is prohibited from escaping, then repeat the hand into the warm water, and let the blood run in the water, until you achieve your purpose
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in the warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And above all, the course of the blood in the warm water is set in the winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this joint is more safe than all the others, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand is useful for the treatment of liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you bind the wrist with a bandage, or your hand itself, after you have introduced the hand into the warm water, until the joint swells up and the sense of coldness appears.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomy is performed by a transverse cut
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein entirely, it will not cause it any harm in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care not to faint from the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under this, the nerves of the fingers are stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again, move the hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow out into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	If you do not move the hand into the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the mouth of the [vein], and will be prohibited from running.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have drawn out the quantity of blood necessary, then place upon the vein oil and salt: that it does not solidify too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	It is also necessary to do this with every tight limb.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The true cause of this phlebotomy is the spleen: and in the same way do it in this phlebotomy as in the second [phlebotomy] equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The veins of the phlebotomy are useful for ailments which are in the lower parts of the body, such as abdominal ailments, retention of menstrual blood, kidney disease, ulcers of the groin and ancient buttocks, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of this phlebotomy is that it allows the sick limb to be introduced into the warm water: and let there be done over it friction, until the veins burst: and ligate above the junction of the limb with ligatures
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins are at the heel, appearing outside the thumb: and they are torn out from it in front of the foot from the ankle bone downwards
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore better to be done in a larger limb, or at the ankle in its collection: because this is better and safer
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you make the phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then take care of the nerves which are under it over the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And make the phlebotomy from the transverse position, like the surgeon who wishes: and let the phlebotomy be as Nesil
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If blood flow is prohibited, then repeat the foot in warm water: and hold back the flow of blood in the vessel until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the vein has slipped from the first incision, then repeat the incision above the former, for the place is safe, and not liable to cause harm, even if you chance to cause damage to nerves, as we have said
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And in like manner with the other foot's vein.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The veins of the sciatic nerve are situated at the heel on the outer side of the ankle bone as we have said
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	The cause of pain in the ankle is a blood clot
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	The quality of the incision is that it should be made with a soft sponge and should be rapid: and bind the limb from the ankle up to the heel with a fine long strip, so that nothing is visible except for that
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the incision of the vessel is to be repeated according to whatever means is possible, or according to the passage of the vessel: and it is better to cut through the vessel by incision or by section
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The place of the vessel is safer, and it is usually hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses at all: then repeat the incision of some branch of the vessel which appears in the heel and is opposite the auricle: and cause the blood to flow out in the quantity that you desire
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place over the site of the incision the skin, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On wound treatment, and the quality of its material.
Caput XCVIII.	On wound treatment, and the quality of its material.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wounds are made from bones, air, and pus.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And wound treatment is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	By scraping and bleeding extraction: or without scraping.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this kind of wound treatment that is without scraping is done in two ways
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or with heat
Aut est absque igne.	Or without heat
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And those wound treatments which are administered with scraping and bleeding extraction are fourteen in number throughout the body
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the treatment of the Alnocrati wound, and it is the last of the head: and the Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the wound treatment of the Alhagdahim, and there are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the wound treatment of the menti is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the wound treatment of the two spatulas: and the wound treatment of the Alachosos over the end of the tail: and the wound treatment of the two focilia, and there are two of the biceps: and the wound treatment of the two cubits: and the wound treatment of the two heels.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And wound treatment does not pull out blood from small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause a loss of blood, as is the case with phlebotomy
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither is it necessary to administer wound treatment with heat, or without heat in any ailment which comes from excessive swelling, until the whole body is evacuated
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	Which if necessity compels us to do for wound treatment on account of an ailment, or because of custom, we administer it at every hour in the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time as needed
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is this, since it is from men that when it multiplies in their blood, until it requires extraction from them by means of vomiting, it finds in their head its greatest weight and burden?
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from this is that it brings about swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from this is that it brings about itching in their face, and forehead, and darkness, and blindness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from this is that it severs the seat of their vomiting.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from this is that their laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from this is that it brings about the taste of blood in their mouth: either the tongue is swollen and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from this is that their sleep multiplies
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from this is that they urinate in their sleep blood and redness, and blood clots, and wounds, which are like these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see any of these things, and it is in the third middle of the month: we command vomiting to be performed immediately, after two or three hours have passed
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The vomiting of the night is thus: because it itself brings about a weight in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It is therefore necessary, that after vomiting of the whole body
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	These are like phlebotomies of the head
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not lawful to use these things in those who are cold in complexion, or in whom there is catarrus
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings about a great danger.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Neither is it proper that these should be used in the case of old men, in whom cold fevers prevail in the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever is too assiduous above his limits will generate for himself an aversion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary, that the surgeon should take hold of the wind, that he should place his hand with the windward side downwards, fearing lest an aversion should be generated thereby
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind or alcohol is the place of the incision of the veins of the groin and of the veins of the belly, and because of this it confers swelling, constriction of the breath, and loss of strength, and cough, and distension of the belly
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to urge the alcohol of the wind slightly downwards, for if it is placed downwards, it generates stiffness in the heart and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The wind or alcohol, when applied too vigorously, causes pain in the head, vomiting, headaches, perforation, and toothache: and it is the place of the incision of the veins of the belly.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that the surgeon take hold of the wind, that he should not place his hand with the incision: that he may not cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to be obstructed.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The alcohol of the wind under the chin causes swelling in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth: and it is the place of the incision of the veins which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The alcohol of the wind causes spitting, which is from reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The alcohol of the wind inside the two cavities of the cheeks causes the drawing out of the veins of the groin, of the veins of the belly, and of the veins of the head: for it attracts blood from all these small veins which are in the flesh: and it attracts these small veins from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, not to advance too far in the incisions: for in such a place the flesh is stripped bare, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The winds of the intestines cause swelling over the ulcers of the rectum, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take heed, so that the incisions be large and open to the air: for in such a place the veins are liable to be broken by excessive suction.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The veins of the limbs grow thin from diminished circulation: for they draw blood from all over the body, and cause ancient pains in the buttocks, thighs, and calves: they cause menstruation, and bring about swelling, and pain: and are in the place of two saphenous veins, and the marrow bones.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The marrow bones are very near to the veins of the limbs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the veins is such that you should apply the incision to the first wound and moderate the suction: and do not prolong the position of the incision, but place it easily and remove it easily, so that the humors may rise to their proper place: and do not desist from this process until the area is red and swollen, and the blood appears red: then indeed you may perform the incision, and slowly resume the suction.</start_of_turn>
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Consider also the position of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has little flesh and few hairs, it is necessary to make the incision once, not twice: so as not to tear the place.</start_of_turn>
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And advise the Wind-Surgeon, that he increase the scarification, and make it shallow: and temper the suction to facilitate, and speed, and the movement of the instrument.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary, that he make the incisions twice
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision he opens a small opening for the evacuation of blood, and washes it: and in the second incision he makes an exquisite extraction of the thick blood
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is dark green, then make a third incision: in order to obtain the utmost
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	Finally, when we wish to extract the blood slowly, or little by little, sufficeth us one incision.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	When we wish to extract a great quantity of blood, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary, that he make a deep incision: and the equal endpoint of the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What must be administered from the oils at the position of the Wind-Surgeon, and what is the cause of the wind-surgeon?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that which the skin is thick, hard, rough, and has close pores, it is necessary that you anoint the area of the Wind-Surgeon with open, soothing, dissolving oils: if it is in summer, such as almond oil, or oil of violets, or sweet fennel oil, or cucumber seed oil
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomilla oil, or salve: and the like.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is excessive coldness, the oil must be amaranth oil, or balsam oil or white oil, or almond oil: and the like.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the belly is full of wind, hold meat: then it is necessary to prevent the bile from going out, and it is necessary to wash the places of the winds after the letting of wind with rose-water, or with cold water, or with salt water, or with cucumber water, or with rainwater: and the like.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	If the blood of a person is full of moisture, wash the winds after letting with vinegar, or with myrtle water, or with alum: and the like.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If there are many thick humours in the blood, wash the winds after letting with old wine, or with rue water, or with fennel decoction, or chamomile: and like these things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	It is necessary to bathe in a bath, or in a bathhouse, immediately after the letting of the wind, and it is necessary to take something for an hour, or two hours, after coming out of the bath.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after the letting of the wind.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that is necessary to do in order to regulate the wind, or to do phlebotomy before the letting of the wind?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after this it is necessary to consider: then if the wind is choleric, or if phlebotomy is necessary, and if there is an excess of heat in the blood: then it is necessary to take something cooling, such as pomegranate seed: and also barley with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and mugwort: and like these things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put the meat on a low diet, and eat coarse bread, and feed the boiled things with fennel: and like these things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And as for one who has a cold complexion, it is necessary to take in a drink of honey syrup, or of aloes, or of acacia honey: and drink a moderate wine, which is between new and old: and it is recommended to eat little food
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place its meat on the cocks, and dogs: and birds, that is, sparrows: and the meat of pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the liquid of the diet on the day of vomiting and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary that it be given in a liquid in which some man has eaten in the hours of twilight or before vomiting, or medicine of the muscle, that is, muskroot, or alehoof before vomiting, or after: in order to comfort the principal members and to temper the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not permitted to take warm food in the liquid.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of Vomiting without Incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those vomiting which are without incision are those which arise from the excess of food in the upper parts of the body, and the spleen, and the foot, and over the belly, the navel, and the region of the kidneys, and the piece of the intestine of the appendix: because these members do not suffer incision over themselves
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not necessary to seek for its ease, except for an attack from a member of the blood to a member: as we place Vomiting on the nipples in the flux of blood from the veins.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we must take care that the cold of the vomiting does not injure the adjacent member: as we place vomiting on the belly and the navel
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For indeed it dilates the member, and warms it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the said vomiting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys, when it happens in the eating of cheese, or bread
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For its own attraction is perhaps opening the vomiting, or driving out the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in the same way it does when it is placed over the spleen and the upper part of the stomach in the vomiting of both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These winds are administered with a small incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water in pleuritic ailments: and this is when the Wind is to be applied, and be great, only warm water alone, or water in which certain herbs have been boiled together.</start_of_turn>
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of Wind administered with fire.</start_of_turn>
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The breadth of its opening is two fingers wide, according as we form it: and the quantity of it in depth is half a palm, and its breadth is in the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity of the needle which is to be inserted: it is made of air, or citrine, thick at the edges, soft, even, rough. Let it not harm the limb in its position over itself: and there shall be in its middle a transverse bar of iron or steel, on which is set the candle with fire.</start_of_turn
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus is this wind made great, greater than we have narrated, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the patient who uses it.</start_of_turn
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The wind of children is great, and those of the extenuates are other than those of men, and of the gross.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wind with fire upon the limb is that you incline the wick with fire from the center outwards, or put a candle already alight from pitch: and put it upon the middle of the transverse bar which is in the middle of the wind, so that the fire is surrounded below the lower part of the wind, so that it does not burn the patient.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it upon the limb: and the finger rests upon the hole which I mentioned, until we have finished with the wind: when we have finished, we remove the finger, and the vapor escapes from that hole, and the wind is at rest immediately.</start_of_turn
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then give the purgative according to its manner, and repeat if it does not work.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In cases of intestinal obstruction due to wind, which is administered with water, there is neither a transverse nor a circular bougie: it is not administered unless the abdomen is filled with water, and is placed over the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	The larger the dose of this purgative, the more water it will absorb
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugars are not administered in multiple places, except in those places where the position of the intestines is not possible due to their density, such as the lip and the tongue, and things of a similar nature
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things of a similar nature
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	The quality of the purgative is: that it be made from blood-sugars which are in sweet water, freed from putrefactions
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are given every day and night in sweet water, until the patient is relieved of hunger, and nothing remains in their belly
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then let the body be evacuated at first with a phlebotomy, and with purges.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then strip the limb of the patient, until it turns red
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place over itself.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they have been administered, and have gone down, and the place has been sucked with the purge, then it is possible to suck the place with the vomit: and if not, then evacuate the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then, when there is much water, and the wound is raw, and has burst open.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	When the flow of blood persists after a burst blood vessel, and there is oozing: then pour a piece of linen cloth into cold water, and place it over the wound, until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	When there is bleeding profusely, then sprinkle powdered alum or gall, and similar things like sponges from the sponges: until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place over the wound cloths of linen which have been scraped: and let them go, until the cloth sticks to the place, for the blood will stop bleeding.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary, if possible, to change the dressing of the blood vessel repeatedly.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If the bleeding is forbidden from being suspended, then the place is washed out with blood which has recently escaped
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or hold pressure in the place, until something comes out of the blood
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then put on [pressure], for when they feel something coming out of the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore they wish to fall asleep, sprinkle upon them something from aloe which has been pounded, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall asleep immediately.

Caput I.	Chapter I.</start_of_turn
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very useful in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.</start_of_turn
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Hear ye, sons of learning! For they that handle this book of the art of healing and of wondrous remedies, who have never once perused the works of the ancients, neither learned a single letter from them.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And thus it is that this method is hidden from our land's sciences
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	I have learned nothing good from it in this matter, and I am not skilled in it except in so far as I have learned from the great books of the ancients, and from their wisdom.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Therefore I have clung to experience and the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	I have set down for you in this chapter all the science which I have learned: and that which has passed my experience, after I had abridged it for you, and I have cast off that which was not essential, and have abridged that which remained, and have brought it to a close.

In summary, and the collection of the facts concerning the fracture of bones, which must precede the consideration of the healing of fractured limbs and of the various methods, if indeed of any of them.
Caput II.	**Chapter II.**
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we have said in the prologue to this chapter, to recall the main points and chapters which are to be considered in the first place by the artisan in his progress: that is to say, those who are learned and those who are prompt, should know, or learn, or add to this noble art, or others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say then, when any fracture, dislocation, twisting, or falling occurs: then it is necessary immediately to draw blood from him, and to bind up the wound, or both together: if nothing else hinders, or is lacking, such as weakness of spirit: or that the patient is young or old and decrepit: or that the time is urgent, either because of the heat or the cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he shall be satisfied with his food, with cold herbs, and with birds’ flesh, and with blood-vessels: and he shall abstain from strong drink, and from fatty meats, and shall restore himself from food and from all food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When he is secure from the heat of the after-flux, and does not fear effusion of the matter to the limb: then the patient may return to his ordinary regimen as soon as he is accustomed to it.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the bone is begun to be restored, then it is necessary, that the patient be nourished with nourishing and bulky food, such as barley bread boiled with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of sheep, and fish, and fresh eggs: and strong drink, and things similar to these
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is quicker and better
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And thou knowest, that bones which are broken when they are in the joints which are in the prime of life, and are decrepit, are not able to continue and consolidate according to their natural tendency always, because of the drying up of the members: and they consolidate and continue only as much as the parts which are in the end of softness, as for example bones of the limbs of new-born children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	But nature annexes to the broken bone from every side something like glue, which has thickness, by which it adheres and contracts it, until they are consolidated together: and they are bound together until they come to the end of their strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it is forbidden by its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient nourishing food which has thickness, and weight, and coarseness, as we have said
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And thou knowest, that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the members: for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and in the same way all the other limbs are different from each other: and I come with the remembrance of the kind of fracture which is exposed in his chapter distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	Diverse forms of bone fractures also exist within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since it is arched in itself, a fracture may also happen in the middle of the bone due to these stars.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	When a fracture occurs along the entire length of the bone, such fractures are called satagiae, that is, stars, and are like scratches made by a knife.</start_of_turn>
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	These fractures are not caused by blows or wounds but by a small crack in the head of the bone.</start_of_turn
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	Every kind of fracture has its own natural ability, or an instrument peculiar to its restoration, according to the memory of the fracture, distinguished in its place.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From this it is known that a bone fracture is characterized by its crookedness, its prominence, and its sensation and sound when the limb is compressed.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When, however, there is no apparent crookedness, no sound under your touch when you touch the bone with movement, and no great pain is found: then it is not a fracture, but perhaps only a slight bending or a small crack. In such a case it is not necessary to move the limb with the hand and compress it entirely, but rather to place above it what the physician remembers, after which the tension should be gradually restored.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	You know that when a bone is arched and breaks into two, besides the stars, all the parts are loosened from their neighbours. In such a case it is necessary for you to begin from the very beginning to restore it, equalizing it before any swelling appears.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however swelling appears, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then it is equal to itself according to whatever mode it is possible from lenity and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equality is easier than bones in which fractures have occurred.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up according to what you remember of its reminder.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from two parts, if it is the hand, or the foot: or with the hand, if it is a small limb: or with two bands, or with a band and a hand.</start_of_turn
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such as you place the limb in a place equal to itself, according to its natural form, until the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then endeavor to make them return to their original positions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever mode you can in the places: and be careful according to your strength, lest you cause more pain or damage through your operation, and endeavor with your strength so that you can apply one bone with its fellow, according to better forms.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in this hour to try and touch your hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If there is anything diverse there, rectify it, and make it equal to that quantity which is in your power.</start_of_turn
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of excessive extension and compression, as do many surgeons.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many of them cause this to happen through their operation, either by making the swelling greater or by causing contraction in the limb: as we have seen this to happen through their operations many times.</start_of_turn
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after the equality, and loosen the operation, and tighten the limb, and rest, and tranquility: and give the patient rest over it.</start_of_turn
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make the patient recline, lest he move in the hour of his greatest heat, and his sleep during the course of his revolution, and his agitation, and at egestion, and all his movements in the end shall be in his weakness.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he recline, lest his limb remain in a position which follows pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain in a position of the limb, or an injury: then it is necessary to change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And that his position be equal and straight: lest there arise stiffness in the limb when restoring it
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The degree of stiffness of the fractured limb is according to what is narrated.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured limbs are diverse in their parts, size, and shape
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	For those which are small, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and the like, it is necessary to apply soft padding, fine
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But for those which are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary to apply a broad and hard padding
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the great limb and stretches it from all parts with equal force, so that it does not adhere to the wound
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have evacuated, start to apply a plaster that is convenient for this, on the stump of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, start to bandage the ligament over the fracture site three or four times, according as is necessary for the limb: and keep your hand firm with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then, support the part above the fracture site from the fracture site and bind less than you bound the fracture site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend the limb with a gentle inward curve at the fractured part, and soften the tightening gradually until you can remove the diseased part from the sound tissue.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take hold of the limb once more and curve it inwards once more over the fractured area with inward curves.</start_of_turn>
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then support it with an inward curve towards the lower part of the fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the curve and the softening of its tension, as we said in the first inward curve.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the inward curves a soft plug of cotton or cloth, so that it equals the thickness of the fracture, if there is such thickness: and if not, do not place anything in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then curve the limb over once more.</start_of_turn>
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then make the two inward curves level with each other, and hold them steady, if there is no swelling, neither a stiff abscess.</start_of_turn
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If, however, there is swelling or a stiff abscess in that place: then place over that what sits on that abscess, and drain the swelling: and leave it alone for a few days.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it once more, and keep the asclepiads in place.</start_of_turn
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the bands be made from the middle of broad and strong reeds, or from wood from which cribri are made, or from palm branches, or from flax stems: and let the width of every bandage be according to this shape and this figure.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	It is true that the bandage which is put over the limb should be wider and thicker than the rest of the bandages: and the length of the bandage should be according to the size and shape of the limb.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over Astellas with the other, according to the first stricture.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over with strings as before, with the centre towards the outside, as we have said concerning the stricture: and it is that the stricture should be greater over the site of the fracture: and the greater the distance from the fracture, the smaller the stricture.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	It is necessary that the strings be of medium size and flexibility, and that they be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the strings are large, like the ropes of stone masons, it is a great error, because the stricture will fall with them outside the measure
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine strings are again unsuitable: for you will not follow the stricture with them as with those things which you wish to follow.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it must not be less between the Astellas than the breadth of a finger
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	Which if the sick man is pained beyond the ends of the Astellas after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the skin a cushion of soft wool, or carded lanolin, until nothing is pained from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the tissue is ruptured in the skin, I shall come with a reminder of that in the second chapter concerning the singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every fractured limb should be strapped with Astellas from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For when the limb is great, it is not necessary to bind over with Astellas immediately, but after five or seven days, or more, according to your security concerning the progress of the wound
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of dressing wounds, which the ancient people used to restore, which they put over fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common abbreviated plaster, restoring the fracture, is suitable for various complexions, especially women and children: since it neither increases nor decreases heat.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	Take from the flour of the mill, and the barley meal which hangs upon the sides of the millstone when the mill is in motion: and make of these things as before, except that you must not make it too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Use it then.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plastering, restoring the fracture, dislocation and torsion
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Rice flour, laudanum, acacia, enula and mugath: and vinegar, in total ten myrrh, and aloes two and a half, and alethil twenty, mix them all together, and crush, and mix with lukewarm water or with gypsum if the patient's complexion is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Use this plastering.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, restores the fractured bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another plastering method that also helps with fractures and torsion
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mugath, flour, white alum, in total ten myrrh, and aloes two and a half, acacia six bol of Armenian bole and twenty, crush them all together, mix with water, or with gypsum. Administer immediately
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of plastering for bone joints that are separated from their places: and it soothes the pain of the accident, and closes the fracture of the bone and the break of the bone
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fine linen, soak it in vinegar and decocted oil: and put it on the place
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	Neither is there any restoration to be had in this Emboplastrum, but it is good to apply a warm poultice: and it drives away the pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The proper treatment for the Embplasia is to restore the fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take broad leaves of fig and rough leaves of willow: and urine them together: and make an embolus from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The brief treatment of the embolus is to apply it to the fracture of the bone: and when you desire the resolution of the remaining apostematis
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of angelica, chamomile, violets and barley flour, take all together: mix them with wine, if there is no warm limb.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If there is indeed a warm limb, then mix it with humid coriander water, or with water, and use it like that
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of treatment for the embolus is stronger for the resolution than the first one, when there is a hard apostemata during the restoration of the limb
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the root of angelica, flaxseed, barley, mastic, sambuca, violets and chamomile, take all together: mix them with salty water, or sweet water, or wine
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	This whole thing according to the warmth of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not speak in his book about placing anything upon the fractured limb during its restoration, except for butter made from cheese: nothing else: and he said that there should be a middle ground between the thickness and thinness
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considers it useful to place upon the fractured limb during its restoration various substances that contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum, and the like of these things which we have mentioned
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of Embasting which pertains to the wound and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Method of Embasting which pertains to the wound and the pain. Take parts of mugwort, ciceris, human hair cut, or feathers of birds, and barley and salt in equal quantities: mix them together, crush and form them: make from this the embastment.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	As for the quantity, however, according to the need, that the ligature remain, afterwards dissolve it, that is to say, as you consider, if not at once, that no pain, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place occur: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If in its place there occur itching or tingling, or painful swelling: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the embastment from it: and take a soft cushion, or a sponge of marine wool, wet: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and bathe with it until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it a dry cloth, immersed in vinegar and olive oil, or olive oil of roses: and bind over it at night once, until you are secure from a hot after-burn, and the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has ceased.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it with slight tightening, and a small embastment: and do not tighten it too tightly at first, but gradually with it.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you have removed the cause, the swelling, the redness, and the pain, and all the other symptoms have disappeared, and the embastment and the tightening are unnecessary, then repeat it as you did at the beginning equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing further happens to the limb of which we have spoken, do not dissolve it, except after three days, or four, or five, or seven days
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	When the wound has healed for forty days in total, according to what appears from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed and coagulation of the flesh has approached above: then add further strengthening than the first throughout: and also add in the digestion of nourishing food, as has been remembered.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If however the place of the fracture has already begun to abate and expand more than is necessary: then you know that nutrition is hindered from reaching it
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	You must therefore bathe it with warm water at every time you wash it, and keep it so for three days, and reduce the dressing somewhat.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this means the limb will receive nutrition and will heal more quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the rest of the restorers of fractures do carelessly with regard to the limb, when they do not restore it at first as they should, according to what is necessary, and restore it crookedly: this is an error in their operation, and a great fear: for if it had been right, the old writers would have said so in their books, and they would have operated in this way.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have never seen anyone do this in this way, and it is better to do it right, so that it does not go wrong.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Of the dressing of an injury to the head.
Caput III.	(This section of the text is unfortunately missing from the provided text.)
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is that which is caused by a blow with a weapon: and the blow raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, as an axe does to wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	If any bone is fractured, and if its face is fractured, and the incision does not penetrate to its very end: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	A fracture is great or small.</start_of_turn>
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	A fracture is either a break or a crushing: the cause of which is impact with a stone, or falling from a height, or something similar.</start_of_turn>
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	There are also penetrating fractures, which are those which approach the bone substance, either on the surface of the bone or in its substance: these are great or small fractures.</start_of_turn
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	There is also an occult fracture which lies within the substance of the bone beneath the hair: this is a small fracture, and for this reason it is called the capillary fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	A fracture is caused by a fall, or by impact with a stone, or by something similar, which produces a bending of the bone inwards: as when a gust of wind breaks a bowl when struck.</start_of_turn
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	This mostly happens in the heads of wet bones, as in the heads of children.</start_of_turn>
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated by a swelling which I shall remind you of in their proper place.</start_of_turn>
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on the surface, by their tenderness, and by the excision of the corrupted flesh which is above the wound.</start_of_turn
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary fracture is recognized by the fact that it is seen on the bone, is stripped away, and is bound above with resin: the fracture itself appears black.</start_of_turn
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the signs of the patient: when you see signs that signify a manifestation above fear, such as vomiting of bile, and swelling, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the skin, and similar signs in various conditions, it is unlikely that it will heal without treatment; and if you see signs not terrestrial to you, and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If he comes to you wounded in the first place when wounded: and it is in the cold days, then it is necessary to study in the ablation of bone before the fourteenth day of the month in every case.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to proceed with great care to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it is corrupted which is under the cartilage, and these are the accidents which we have mentioned
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has reached the cartilage touching the brain, and it is with small pieces and attraction: then it is necessary to cut away the comminuted and attracted part, according to what has been told you
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary to wash the head of the wounded: and remove from the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is best for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	And if it happens to you during the detection of the flowing blood, or a soft swelling: then oppose it with what is necessary for the treatment.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary to place the place with soaked cloths in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then commence with the care of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is as follows: you cut the bone with a straight chisel and a strong knife: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then you manage another chisel after the wider one has gone past: and this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then you manage another chisel which is even wider than the previous one.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have several chisels of different sizes: some of them are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and they are of iron or steel, and you use them easily in striking on the chisel, so that it does not break the head and damages it.</start_of_turn
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to pierce through its circumference before you manage the chisels, with pins which are called non-deep pins: and they are not called thus except when they do not pass beyond the end of the bone and the cartilage at that point: because the pin is the rounded extremity above that, which is under the acute angle, like the margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn>
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take from these pins a great number, of which each one corresponds to the quantity of thickness of the bone, until they are present throughout the circumference: whose acute extremities in length and width are according to the quantity of the thickness of that circumference.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of pins, or trephines.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation in the circumference of the fractured bone is: to place the thumb over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the thumb to another place, and place what is between every hole the quantity of the diameter of the radius, or somewhat more around it
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then make an incision between every hole on the bone: and do it more delicately than the thickness of the bone from the end of its curvature, as we have said, until you break the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have at hand: such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to take care, that you do not touch the thumb, or any instrument with your lips.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have completed the perforation of the bone and it has been separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is still connected to it, you must extract it, and repair the surrounding tissues with something similar to the instrument which you have used
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However it is necessary that it should be thin and slight compared to other instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything small of the bones and fat: then grasp them with ease with the instrument which is with you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after this with the instructions which we have given, and with the dressings which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, especially for one who is long in fear: which Galenus praised highly and praised him for: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary for you at first, to remove the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most pronounced, and most obvious: until you have detected that part, and placed under it the tip of this lenticular incision.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the blunt part of the lens does not sink anything: and the acute part of it widens in two of its sides along its length, like water: so that the blunt part of the lens rests close to the sac, its acute face being incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then pierce straight through the incisor from one side with a small mallet, until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it is turned over: and you will be safe from the spur, which does not happen in this case, as you are afraid beforehand
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant of this than anyone else, or is asleep, then if anything remains connected to the bone from the spur in some place, he will remove it from that with the extremity of the lens itself, and will set it free easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is set free from it without damage, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the marrow, and that which is detached from the bone is its surface, and remains in it rough and scaly: then it is necessary to smooth that roughness, and scrape off those scales with fine files of various sizes, so that it is possible to apply something in every place which is more convenient and better for them, and to make them straight, according to what is required by the operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary to proceed with your reason, that in the first place you should file the larger of the bones, and then the smaller ones with the files.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer one afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this until you have reached the point of administering the finest and subtlest of them all
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	And in every small fracture remaining after the extraction of the stones, and the slight fracture, it is necessary to take care, according to what is required for its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	It is a thing which is not hidden over all, concerning which there is study in this art, and which stands over that which we have written, and which we shall show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a clot is detected to remain when you are fracturing a bone: then it is necessary that you grasp the clot, according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in oil of roses, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then grasp another or three clots, and submerge them in wine and oil of roses, and place them over the first clot: and make it as easy as possible for the blood to flow over it, so that it does not clot further.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then support the surrounding ligament: and do not tighten it, except for the amount which is necessary to hold the wound together: and remove it with care after one or two days, until you are secure from the hot after-effect.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then finish it off, and administer afterwards such medicines as are useful for excessive swelling: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herbs, and barley flour, and violets, and marjoram: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder, which you shall sprinkle over the wound like dry dust.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And in general, administer all medicines which have the property of drying, and not of biting
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be cautious according to your skill, so that the wound in your care may be limp: neither soft nor harsh
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let blood clot together in this way: for when blood clots together over a clot of the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm: and this happens in head wounds, when its care is neglected, and it turns black on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore now, if any accidents befall a sick person, as we have mentioned, you know that it is perilous to delay treatment.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If indeed it does not occur, except for the medicine that is placed upon him, and it is in the benefit of that medicine, that it should make him black: then you must take from the honey a portion one, from rose oil three portions, and lines like these with the ointment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then apply it upon the wound: afterwards take care of him with the methods that are suitable, until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	When the nose is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts together, or one of them: because these are two bones: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, and does not happen to it except for attrition, and twisting, and similar things.</start_of_turn
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert the little finger into the nose-hole, and equal it with the fracture of your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural position: and do this with art, with ease.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach the finger: then you must equalize the extremity of the radius, in which there is little thickness.</start_of_turn
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in both parts, then do the same: and straighten it out along with the restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day at the quiet place of the calid apostematis
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If the nose or a tooth is affected, then it is necessary to treat it with poultices: and administer a lead cannula until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	In the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Caput V.	Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if the fracture is only superficial and does not split into two pieces, and it is being healed inwards: in this case the fracture is easily recognized.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the bone: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it until the swelling of the fracture is brought out through the outer part of the bone towards the middle, and with it equalize the fracture itself
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer an extrusion from both parts, according to the rule: until an equalization is possible between them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however there is a commotion or disruption in the teeth: then bind those which you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place over the fractured jaw a cushion
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a doubled bandage, and place over the bandage a large sponge made from the middle part of a sole: or an equal piece of skin of a foot
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agree with its application: until it is not broken: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him soft food
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day.
Caput VI.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	If, however, you suspect that something has altered with regard to some figure or mode: then proceed cautiously and cure it on the third day
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Neither is it to break and divide into two, except that they happen in these clots: for it is easier to restore the latter.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Except that they happen in these clots: for it is easier to restore the latter.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Except that there is fracture with wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in these cases when there is fracture without wound, that is, as you make the fractured bone visible by means of two assistants, that one holds the fractured fragment and the other extends the limb beyond the fractured part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of the fingers, until it takes its form, as it should: and it should not be prominent, nor hollow.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If, however, it does not yield with extension, then it is necessary to put under the patient's thumb a sphere of wool or lint: and let its magnitude be according to the quantity of need: and extend and elevate the fractured bone, and cover the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, as it should be
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If it does not succeed in drawing out the fractured limb towards the exterior: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary to recline the patient on his side: and put under his arm the middle finger of his hand in magnitude, and bring the minister of the arm towards the lower part: until the fractured bone which is in the depth comes up: and then straighten the fracture and equalize the fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel pain from the fracture, and it moves: then it is necessary to find over that and extract it with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then think of an incision for it with one of the [instruments] which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the fracture the instrument which will grasp the clot: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a conch shell which has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its breadth is according to that which is digested from the size of the bone, and its thickness is equal to that of the bone itself
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities like nails: one is wide and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the disruption of the wound which you scored when you extracted the bone is wide, secure it from the spur with a hot dressing: then join together the two lips of the wound with a suture
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or the spur is soft: then shut the wound with stitches and pieces of lint according to the quantity of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is a soft spur, then pour oil of roses, alum, wine and fat on it, and place above it
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The fracture of the bone which is without wound and without section is, as if you placed over the bone a plaster made of flour with barley or wheat germ
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft cushion over it
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its head if you digest it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, which is, a circle like that which the Saracens hold, which is long like two palms, or about this much
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled bandage over the cushion and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a needle from a thin board, whose breadth is three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then insert the instrument into the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then insert the instrument with the hook at the location of the fracture which falls upon the fracture and the place of the break.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the fracture over the fracture as if turning it round, and insert the instrument over the neck of the fracture and under the healthy tile and under the broken tile: and reduce the instrument over all the parts, and as much as the surrounding structure allows, for the fracture has become loose by the tightening of the structure.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to take care of the fracture every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament is softened and the hook is able to move it: then make it straight and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place under his tile near his sleep some small cushions in the night, so that when he is lifted up his attendant will not be in the same place as him
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by elevating the arm.</start_of_turn>
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the chest: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen in the place of injury, or from swelling, up to twelve days.</start_of_turn>
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you wish to see his face to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And keep tight the structure, and let go of him, until he has recovered and the fracture has clotted.</start_of_turn>
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the collarbone is bound and comforted according to most people in eighty days: and when it is in some people in less time.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Paragraph on the restoration of the fractured Spatula.</start_of_turn
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and in its wide place: and they do not break from its margins except for the space between its teeth.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it breaks from that place, and breaks in the middle, and is not recognized except by touch: then one must prepare it according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it above the natural shape in every way possible, which is possible for you
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put over the place a fine powder of mill-wheat with alum, and a soft cushion, and put above it a small piece of cloth doubled over
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put over it a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula, or slightly more
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is a concavity in some place of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with a soft cushion until the bandage descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind around it with a long bandage, gentle tightening, and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Every time it is softened, string it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and lie the patient on his side with his sound limb resting on his sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula will be restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When these days are complete, then loosen the ligament: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For the bones from which the ligament is composed do not break immediately, nor are they easily dissolved
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, it proceeds from a broken bone, and penetrates under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said in the case of a broken bone from the relaxation of the after-ache of the cold, if anything arises from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of a fractured chest bone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest bone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rarely the case.</start_of_turn>
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities fracture most frequently, and break from its accidents.</start_of_turn
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting blood, and a displacement of the fractured bone is declared, not hidden from sense. The restoration of it is that the patient be placed supine on his back: and place between his shoulder blades a cushion.</start_of_turn
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his arms, and join his ribs from two parts or sides with hands: and slightly flex them in equilibrium, as much as is possible for it and it agrees, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a compress and bandage, and place above it a plaster from a thin board of willow, or chalk, and from similar materials in lightness, after you have bound up the limb in cloth.</start_of_turn
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then slightly tighten the bandage around the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and stay with the bandage as round as possible to the back, and bind it tightly.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it is softened, tighten the bandage: and if its necessity indicates its solution because of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then remove it, and heal the wound, and remove the plaster, and restore what has happened in the way of its treatment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	If the moisture has reached the face, reduce the plaster, and bind it firmly until healing has occurred.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When the bones are fractured, restore them.</start_of_turn>
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the bones does not happen except in large places following the backbone, and from the extremities from the front part.</start_of_turn
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen except by attrition, because they are cartilaginous.</start_of_turn
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in the inquiry with the fingers.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that the fracture is equal to the fingers according to a possible method, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plaster the bones, and bind the fractured bone with a hook, if necessary for that.</start_of_turn
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the bones is sloping inwards: then it happens with weak pain that he feels, and swelling, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and spitting blood: and this is difficult to cure.</start_of_turn
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And indeed the ancients were skilled in these things with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should put on bandages the sick who generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is inflamed, and expands, and drives the fracture outwards.</start_of_turn
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abhor that it should be a cause of making a callous plaster, if it does not happen.</start_of_turn
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it happens, then we add to it.</start_of_turn>
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some have said: Let a wet place be placed upon the site, and then be squeezed with force, for it is similar in reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Indeed, it is known that the swelling attracts the superfluous humors to the place, by reason of the disposition of the bones.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some have said: It is necessary that the place should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in warm fat: and they put feathers between the ribs until it is firm: that there may be an equal ligation when you bind it according to the circumference
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then care for the patient with treatment of pneumonia from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If he coarsens the patient while he is vomiting, which he cannot tolerate, and the jaw is fractured by biting or from a wound, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary that we split open the place and remove the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place upon it an instrument which preserves the bowels, whose memory preceded it: and we break the bone with ease, and we break the bone itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we join together two lips of the wound, if there is a great one with a suture: and we care for it with poultices, until it is healed
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a cold abscess arises, then deal with it, and pour pultices of rose-water over the place, and place upon it: and care for the patient with that which agrees with the abscess
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Also during this time rest upon the side over which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Of the restoration of a fracture of the neck of the scapula and the collarbone.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the collarbone often fracture when a violent blow is struck to them, and rarely is there any abrasion: and it is the same with the scapulae of the back
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then be silent.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	When anything happens to anyone, and you wish to know whether he is saved or lost: then be silent. For if you touch his hand, and he is limp and stunned, and dead: you cannot move him, neither extend him, neither bind him. And when you bind him with your fingers and with pins and needles, he feels neither pain nor relief: then you know that he is not saved, and death is imminent.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	When he moves and feels relief in his constriction with your fingers and needles: then you know that the broken bone is healed, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	When the patient groans like a camel suffering from the bites of worms, and you wish to know whether he is saved or not: then look at his feet. Then if you see that his limbs are limp and that he is suffering in his hands: then when he lies down on his back, his bowels evacuate without his will. And when he lies down on his belly, his bowels evacuate without his will. And when he lies down on his back and wishes to move, and he is unable: then you know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Do not toil in his care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to him from this, things are easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	His treatment from this is as follows: to give him lukewarm oil of roses. So, put some on the back of the patient only: or mix it with rue or asafoetida.</start_of_turn>
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put some on his back every day, until when the swelling has subsided: then put on one of the following compresses on the place where it hurts, an astringent, and bind it up with a ligament. And command the patient to rest quietly and peacefully.</start_of_turn>
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let him not sleep over the part where he finds the pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If anything happens at the fracture of a bone which is separated from the rest: then it is necessary to cut over the skin and elevate that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together two lips of the wound, if there is a large one, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If however the bone is fractured at the heel of the foot, and the end of the limb is broken: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the heel, and equal the fractured bone by the other hand, as much as possible, and with an evenness
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on a dressing, and elevate it: and care for the wound with the care which went before, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of an ankle
Caput XI.	(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter 11, so I am unable to translate it.)
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for a comminution at the extremities: and they are split in length, and lean inwards: and there is pain in the place, and swelling: and the limb which is fractured stiffens
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as the figure of it is
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equal it up, according as it is prepared for you from the equality, until the figure of it is equal to its natural form.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture lies in length, or if it slopes downwards towards the interior: then let the patient be placed upon his belly, until such time as the restoration of the fracture is prepared.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When it is equal, place upon it a bandage: then place upon it a cushion of wood or leather: and bind tightly around it what you do not wish to shift the fracture, nor remove the cushion.</start_of_turn>
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of these with that which supports it, until you have taken hold of the patient firmly: and command the patient to sleep upon his back, or upon his side which is sound.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a swelling of warmth arises: then cease from the extension of it, and from the restoration: until the swelling of warmth has subsided: and place upon it what rests upon it, according as before, then return to the restoration of it: and bind it as you please.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed it has happened in the thigh bone, or is fractured, extract it.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the aides.</start_of_turn>
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aide is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.</start_of_turn
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: take a plane piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape which follows.</start_of_turn
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And they are bound at both ends by two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a high place: and the patient sits upon a seat.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his arm with the fracture over a stick until it reaches the elbow of the limb, where there is a swelling of the bone.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he hangs something heavy from above, in order to extend the limb downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor grasps the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, as it should be
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the patient lies on his side: and he hangs his arm from the collarbone with the ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part, and extend each of them to their part
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish, that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with the ligament, and above with another ligament: and extend both of them to the two parts
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the elbow of the arm, then it is necessary to put on one ligament under the elbow and another under the fracture around the cubit
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to put on a ligament above the place and above the elbow itself
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture without effort, until the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply a good dressing: then bind the limb, if it does not swell abnormally
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed swelling occurs abnormally, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on above it a wet bandage dipped in vinegar in vinegar and rose oil, until the swelling subsides: then bind the limb. And the way to bind the limb is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new layer of dressing over the wound.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then put on a bandage over the aid itself, and place your hand open over your shoulder
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a bandage, and bind over the bandage the arm, so that the arm remains in the place of the bones: if it does not prevent you by anything from this, nor does anything break over you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If at any time something breaks over you from the broken bone, then put on a larger and stronger bandage over the fracture itself
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put on between every bandage the width of a finger: and let the length of the bandages be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the bandages as tightly as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding over the fracture should be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the less tight the binding should be
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you have put on the bandage and the binding, as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, then do this: and if at any time there is swelling, then loosen the binding and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in every three days, that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it should not be hindered from nourishing the limb, by the arrangement of the excessive binding
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct this therefore all, according to what we have said
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are confident, that nothing will happen from this: then do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep rest upon his back, and his hand upon his stomach: and place under his aid a full bladder of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider at all times of night or day that the limb should not be fractured, or the ligament relaxed
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Straighten therefore all the more the pain you feel
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order we have given, so that the food be soft at first, until the bone begins to knit: then it is necessary that he swallow his food diligently
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	As for the habit of the attendants and the limb: let them bind in quadraginta days: then it is necessary that it be loosed, and a bath be administered, and unguents be used which will rectify it
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture should be painful, raw: then do not loosen from it the ligament and the bone until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm
Caput XIII.	(This section of the text is not included in the provided Latin text.)
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two ulnae.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the upper arm, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater bone is fractured alone, or the forearm: and perhaps both are fractured together
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the fracture of the upper forearm occurs, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower bone is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones break together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If indeed one bone which has broken is slightly above the middle, then the physician must be consulted in order to restore it, so that he may put back the fragment with ease, until it is equal again.</start_of_turn>
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the fragment is large: then it is necessary to put on a stronger dressing around it.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is necessary to put on the figure of the hand at the restoration of it, and to extend the limb beyond the wrist.</start_of_turn>
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be above the height of all the fingers: and let the lower joint be above all the fingers, or the rest: and let the limb be sitting square upon itself, and let the wrist be forward of it, or in a straight line, in height, so that the limb does not incur any strain.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the limb of the arm from the lower part, or the hand itself, or with the ligament.</start_of_turn
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb extends in like manner.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician must equal the bones, until he has reduced them to a better shape than before.</start_of_turn
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	And if there are gaps in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their place with your care.</start_of_turn
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	And if indeed there appears in it a separated fragment, and it has burst through the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner which we mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	And if indeed the fracture is with a wound, I will make for that the single head, so take care of the cure of that from here on.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If in the beginning of your restoration the heel is stiff, then stretch the band with a slip made from oleoso resin, white lead, and be equal between the thickness and fineness: and bind the band above the stricture with a fine string, until the heel settles down: then remove the slip and apply a plaster prepared from pounded barley flour with eggs.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture be wider and stronger
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	You know that the number of sponges of the Brachium is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one socket, or in two sockets together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your bandage stronger and more tightly over the fracture, and somewhat more above the fracture, or below it: or put on a softer bandage under the bandage above, according as the memory of the fracture is great at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, wet: and not hard, rough
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is used to tie be from flax, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens whose rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water, until the itching ceases, and then loosen the limb, until it is quiet, and then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are like these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until the nourishment comes to it again, and then tie it again
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, no improvement occurs in the patient with anything we have mentioned, it is not necessary to persist in the treatment, except after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	The treatment of the patient is to be suspended for a period of twenty days or thereabouts.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	The patient's condition should be stable, and any disturbing factors should be avoided.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Let him sleep upon his back
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	Know that this fracture heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and sometimes in eighty days
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	This is all in accordance with the temperaments of the complexion and the virtue of the patient.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Regarding the restoration of fractures of the hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers are rare
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	They do not occur except with great attrition
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, however, such a fracture of the limb or attrition occurs: then it is necessary that the patient sit upright: and before him should be placed a support which is equal in height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place the hand above his head stretched out
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then extend the broken bones and keep them even with the doctor until the union is complete
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster or bandage, if the swelling does not subside
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage above and below according to the quantity of the place: and cover the hand with linen cloth
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is below the middle of the limb, then make a sphere from cloth: and order the patient to rest with his fractured limb resting on his hand: then bind with a long bandage
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the stars be from the skin, in which there is suppleness, so that the skin may be applied to the body of the plant: and bind it securely as required.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	And if the fracture is to the exterior, then it is necessary: that thou place a star above, and a star below in the plant: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, as it is turned over with the hand: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if it happen that the fracture be of any bone of the fingers, then if it be the thumb, it must be equalised as required.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	And bind it with the plant: and if you tie it too tightly, place upon it a star which is straight, firm: so that the fracture be elevated, and not be moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	And if the fracture be of the remaining fingers, as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it must be equalised, and bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or they may be bound all together according to the continuation: and that is better
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place upon it a star which is firm as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in the restoration of it, and after the setting of the limb: and oppose with it that which is required, when anything of that happens again, according as its narration is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.
Caput XV.	(The provided text does not include any further content, so the translation of the remaining sections is not included.)
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The thigh bone is fractured in many places, and is declared by sense: because it is turned inward and outward towards the parts
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that the ligament is bound above the fracture, and the ligament is bound below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick man returns over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around the part in question according to their equality: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, there is a fracture close to the root of the hip, then let the ligament be to the part of the hip, so that the extension rests above: and let the other ligament be under the fracture
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in the same way if there is a fracture close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, so that the extension rests downwards
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then let the physician equalize the bone with his two hands, until he has reduced it according to the natural shape: and join the bone with a good suture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to put on a dressing and a bandage, if the limb is not already stiff
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	Which if it happens in this way: then let it be left for a few days, until the swelling has subsided, and then return to your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The stricture of it thus be
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture with soft material, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and let remain from it the surplus.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the nail
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg close to the knee downwards, and bring the extremities of the thread from the upper part of the two parts
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and the hip what remains from the surplus of the other side
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place over the hip in the place of the fracture itself little nails, and place over the bone of the leg one little nail.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then the practitioner fills up the gaps between the groin and the knee with soft substances, so as to even out the tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then commence from the middle with strong tension at the site of the fracture, with three or four inversions.</start_of_turn>
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you stretch out from the fractured area with the ligament, the smaller and softer will be your tension.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then take two threads to the two extremities which you have introduced between the groin and the knee.</start_of_turn
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Fasten thus with both three knots which are above.</start_of_turn
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then draw up with both ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle bone.</start_of_turn>
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have drawn up both strings also the other ends of the strings from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip out of its place.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tension above it, while it remains, so that no deformation, neither swelling, neither inflation, nor anything similar to these occurs to the limb.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	Which if anything of this happens.</start_of_turn
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Properly therefore with the solution of this, and correct what happened before, as we have said many times.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed in the bone there is a piece of bone which is pressing: then it is necessary, if possible, to equalize that.</start_of_turn
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above that and remove that: and care for it with that which went before, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the knee is bound up, besides adding to it knots, as we have said in the chest and arm.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Truly, in restoring it thus fractured, no infirmity occurs with halting.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	Though it be restored alone, besides what is applied to the other limb, then it is necessary that the limb which has been fractured should halt, always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	Moreover, you know that the cox is strung for fifty days, or is added a little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the diversity of temperaments, and the remaining qualities.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured rotula genu (knee).
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the rotulae genu are rarely fractured, but they are often subjected to great attrition.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it is fractured, then it is not without a crack or a break, or a hole in its parts.</start_of_turn
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is like a wound, and without a wound.</start_of_turn
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that all with sense.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it be equal to what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is reunited and joined together as much as possible, with ease and fabrication.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster of ground barley, or wheat, with albumin or oil: and put over that a round cushion, if you like: and bind up from above with a convenient bandage.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we have narrated in the other fractures: such as the swelling of the limb, and the like: thus, that you may oppose every accident with that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fractured limb of the shin.
Caput XVII.	On the restoration of a fractured limb of the shin.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the shin consists of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris, and the other is thin and is called the Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	Just as happens with both kinds of fracture that occur in the bones of the forearm: and because of this, its restoration is equal to that of the forearm, and the operation is the same
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the shin turns towards all parts
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If the thin bone is fractured, the shin turns towards the anterior part
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If the thick bone is fractured, it is found beneath: and this is from that which does not cover the bone
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equalization, and ligation of the ligaments according to that which is equal
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	But it is necessary to know that if the fracture of the shin is a compound fracture, having much swelling: so that the extension should be less, and the alleviation more gentle
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the shin there is something like that which happens with the arm: that when you equal the bandages, and have completed all your operations, then take two boards of pine wood which are used in the fabrication of sandals which are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose those which are of small size, and neither are they of great size: and be as long as the shin from the knee to the heel
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then bind over one and a half times the thickness of the limb with two bands according to its length
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the shin from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee to the heel of the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two layers of tissue in three places from two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the tension prohibits a fold, the heel of the leg bends to the right and left, and remains firmly in place.</start_of_turn>
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed a bandage is administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and is placed on the leg, so as to hold it still.</start_of_turn
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most importantly, it is necessary that you make the limb firm when there is a fracture so that it is healed properly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and study it carefully for any swelling, or pain, or other symptoms.</start_of_turn
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything like this happens, then oppose it with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills it.</start_of_turn
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the foot and the toes.</start_of_turn>
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.</start_of_turn>
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel does not usually fracture completely.</start_of_turn
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot fracture sometimes, and the toes even less so: and they do not fracture except through violent pressure in various positions.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the heart, then support the limb on the earth prepared for it like a walker.</start_of_turn
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stay still, and place your foot on that which is being elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or bind up the ankle: and keep it even, until it returns to its proper place.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply an ointment, and cover it with a dressing: and place under the foot a board with two flat heads.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind the string with the foot in a secure manner, after you have included the limb with the bandage, and the rest as needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For the bone is found equal, whether it is fractured or displaced.</start_of_turn>
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is like that of an oil bath.</start_of_turn
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any finger is fractured, then restore it and equalize them as I have said concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put under the finger a cushion according to the length of the finger, and let it be wider than before: then put under the foot the board which I have mentioned, and bind the string with the foot in a secure manner.</start_of_turn
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed it is broken from the bones are two, or three, or more, then put over every finger a cushion of its own quantity, enclosed in linen: and bind the board at the lower part of the foot: and let it rest on one head of the board outside the foot, so that it may hold the retention of the good.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you, that you should not forget, that you should consider all that I have said concerning the remaining fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with that which is necessary.</start_of_turn
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Of the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the bone of the hip, and the swelling of the man.</start_of_turn
Caput XIX.	(The remainder of the text is not included in this request.)</start_of_turn>
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.</start_of_turn
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline the body towards the lower part of the back and hold it back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the surgeon grasp the thigh with his hand and hold it firm until he has grasped it: and let the limb be round like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman shall be brought close, and the back shall be raised slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	Thus the thigh is drawn outwards, until it stands before the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a cushion over the back of it.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wishes to move, move the thigh easily, then join together: and reduce it according to the manner in which you introduced it at the beginning: then return to its cushion first
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Make it rest for seven days, or thereabouts, and the bone will be restored
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take an egg-cup or a vessel, and string over its hole a thread of flax, and introduce the whole egg-cup into the vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow through the thread with a breath, until the egg-cup is inflated inside the vulva, and the fracture will be restored
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be held with the thigh, and remain for a while as we have said, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the hip is fractured, whether in a man or a woman, then manage its restoration and its healing in the same way as we have said concerning the bone of the thigh.</start_of_turn>
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in its near fractures, which happen rarely, especially in those who have studied or are learned.</start_of_turn>
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Therefore understand this book of mine well, for a fracture itself signifies to thee in various positions the alteration in restoration of its own structure.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the bone is fractured in a limb, grasp the opening of the wound: and introduce the instrument into the very same place.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon it a covering of lint, and cover it, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	As for the restoration of fractures of bones, when they are associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.</start_of_turn>
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It agrees with him upon whom it has happened that a fracture is associated with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or the thigh bone, or the forearm, so that you must immediately perform phlebotomy: if you recognize that there are conditions for phlebotomy, such as the above.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If there is bleeding from the wound, then it is necessary to order the abscission of it, so that it is powdered above the wound: if there is nothing else present.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not postpone it, if it does not occur spontaneously.</start_of_turn
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed spontaneous healing occurs, then cease the restoration on the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third day, and the fourth day altogether, for you will cause him to suffer additional injuries.</start_of_turn
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If indeed the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary to order that you reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and with little extension.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, it is not prepared for extension, and its equality is equal to your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	The instrument is made of iron, its length being equal to the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	Therefore, the physician must take three, or four according to the quantity that is necessary for the cure of every kind of fracture
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	It should be rounded: and its size should be small, so that it does not double under compression in the hour of operation: and its edges should be acute, which should have a margin on their edges.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And its upper part should reach from the middle to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is carried out in the operation, so that its acute edge is placed curved over the protruding extremity of the bone: and it is pushed in with that liquid one until the bone returns and is equal to four times its equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	To attempt to make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other on one side.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its extremities are slightly fractured and do not grasp well with the instrument, then it is permissible to cut off the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, it does not seem possible to reduce them with this as we have said throughout: then cut it with that which corresponds to the Scissors which we mentioned: or bind it with one clamp in whatever way is possible to you
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then leave that which remains in the bone from asperities and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone has been reduced, and it is found to be painful after reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position
Fac ergo illud.	Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	Do this then. For you confer great relief to the sick when you complete your restoration of them as much as you do the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the bandage in strong vinegar, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place upon the wound a greasy cover or anything containing oil: so that it does not cause it to become inflamed and corrupt
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer as necessary at the end of your restoration of the bone
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the wound: thus, you will cut through with scissors the hole in the swelling according to the quantity of the wound
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take care in all things, lest you tighten the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times, indeed, have these things been done carelessly by doctors: and they have caused accidents to their patients, either death or corruption, or swelling, that is, illness.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your treatment be gentle, lenient, diverse in the strictures of the remaining fractures
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or if it is large, and you fear some other mishap which we have mentioned, and if you find pain in the suspended part: then it is not proper to put on any plaster.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for yourself from strong paper incisions in the place of the plaster, and tighten it with these.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however, after one or two days, and the wound has begun to heal, pus has formed: then remove from above the plaster which you put on with the vinegar
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer ointment and unguents which are customary with us for healing wounds: such as ointment of butter and the like
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is necessary for you to solve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus may drain downwards easily.</start_of_turn>
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound days pass by and it is not consolidated, nor does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small bones there.</start_of_turn
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore you must inquire about the wound with care.</start_of_turn
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these small fragments are separated from the wound: remove them and extract them.</start_of_turn
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what is not separated from them but pierces the limb, causing pain: try to cut them out and remove them in any way possible.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If swelling or swelling occurs at the wound, or a boil or other corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary to oppose each of these things with that which is suitable for their treatment, as has been mentioned in the chapter.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning that in which you must understand my words, and to which you must pay attention when a bone is fractured and projects outwards, such as the hip bone, and the kneecap, and similar parts of large limbs, it is necessary not to fear its attraction, for much harm results from it, indeed it is better to remove it than to leave it, until it decomposes.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then indeed care for the wound, if you see it: and otherwise, remove it.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of the swelling caused by a fractured bone.
Caput XXI.	On the treatment of the swelling caused by a fractured bone.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this swelling occurs in the area of healing of a fractured bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Specifically, which is close to the joint: and it is caused by the shape of the limb
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And sometimes it hinders the limb from its natural action
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider at once, if the swelling is recent: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Yes, take some of these from these: and mix them with wine which has styptic properties, or with albumin or with vinegar: and apply them over the swelling on a cushion, and bind them over the fracture itself securely
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And remove the support, and do not keep it bound for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen the limb, and repeat this until the swelling subsides
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the limb a layer of lead foil which has been softened in the middle
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of removing all that is threatening to the limbs
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the swelling has already hardened and is fixed, and there is need to remove it: then find above the limb from its upper part, and cut away the excess: or scrape the limb with some rough objects until the swelling subsides: and take care of the limb until it heals
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When the limb is restored and the swelling has subsided, the limb remains under its natural shape
Caput XXII.	When the limb is restored and the swelling has subsided, the limb remains under its natural shape
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains below it subtle and feeble, it does not become well except for multiple causes, such as the stiffness of the ligament, which hinders the nourishment of the limb, or excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time, or for want of blood in the body and its weakness.
Et administra balneum.	And bathe the limb.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And give it comfort and joy over it.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a plaster on the limb: so that it attracts plenty of nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And anoint it regularly with warm water, until the nourishment recovers and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ On the treatment of fractures when they have been restored tortious.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the limb has been restored after healing from its fracture, and its bending persists, or there is a swelling: and the limb is hindered by that shape, although the limb is not prohibited from its natural action by the operation, it does not follow that it should be broken again
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very dangerous, harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and swelling are recent: then it is necessary to anoint it with warm water containing soothing herbs, such as elder leaves, and the root of this, and melilot, and similar things
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a patch with softening plaster, as for a diachronic centre made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let there be taken root mucilage of elderberry and pounded with fat of a hen, or with beeswax: and plastered thereupon.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let there be taken poppy seed, and ground with columbine seed, and such like things as are named by the physicians to reduce consolidation
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling has been softened by constant friction, as of old, and with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And move the limb about to every part in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the swelling has preceded the pain, and has become strong, and has become fixed in stone, and has required excision, then it is necessary to cut off the excess above it, and to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what remains of the swelling or bone with fine instruments: and facilitate this with request and care
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	From the discourse on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of any articulation from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb's figure
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the production of greater pain, and wounds which are dangerous to the limb.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore such a dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to act with speed to restore it: and do not delay at all
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will become swollen, and perhaps with this the reduction of the dislocation will be more difficult
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary to move or extend it during the swelling
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since many things cause spasms and painful aches.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	When such a thing happens, it is necessary to perform phlebotomy on the patient immediately.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be discharged until the swelling subsides
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	And it should be bound with warm water and oil
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Let the swelling be gently reduced
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And care for every limb so that its memory remains in its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I command you to join the head of dislocation and the extremities of the fracture from the upper part of the body to the lower part of the body
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	As for the care of the lower jaw dislocation
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles rarely dislocate except in rare cases.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And both dislocations happen according to two different methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either by slight displacement from their places and gentle softening.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or by complete dislocation, lasting until they are softened at the breast, until the patient can no longer bear the pain, and cannot close his mouth, and his tongue is swollen with saliva
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself without any treatment
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, the dislocation is complete, lasting: it is necessary to perform a reduction of it immediately, and it must not be delayed: and let the physician keep hold of the thumb of his hand with one hand on the root of the dislocation of the mandible between the bones, if the dislocation is from one side only
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If the dislocation is from two parts, let him introduce two fingers simultaneously.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	The remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, so that they may support it equally.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	Furthermore, he must command the patient to open his jaw widely and grasp with all his teeth
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The doctor must stabilize the jaw and urge the jaw back to its place until it returns to its normal position
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are displaced simultaneously: then he must give him a lukewarm drink of water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: neither must he attempt to reduce them both at once, as we have said before
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have returned and are equal, and the patient's bone is closed, and they are not softened: then he must place over the teeth of the patient two fingers, with wax which is made of beeswax: and oil of roses.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And then they are bound with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	The patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be resting between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left: neither must he be forced or urged to swallow: rather let him eat slowly, until when he has moved the pain, and closed the jaw: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be given to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not toil over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and swallowing, until the jaw is closed and healed
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and they are not returned to their places: then many times fever and bitter vomit follow: and perhaps the patient's belly becomes soft, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore the aid has been performed: then you know that it is a loss, and many times the patient dies from it within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Furcula indeed does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuity with the chest
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It dislocates outwards sometimes: and it is declared by the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back, and extends his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your palm of your hand with a strong bandage, for it will return by itself
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place over it a pad, and beads, and bind it tightly
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities following the elbow do not dislocate with it, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If indeed it dislocates on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and equalised as we have said, and that it be prepared for you
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over it a pad, and beads, and bind it tightly
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same cure has reduced the extremity of the Humerus, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	The first is that it dislocates to the part of the elbow downwards
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Secondly, it is necessary to displace [the bone] to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	Or perhaps to the upper part of the humerus: and that is rare
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	It does not displace to the back, because of the swelling.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	It does not displace to the front, because of the nerves
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Mostly, however, it is displaced and comes down to the lower part of the chest: especially in those where the flesh is scanty
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it comes out quickly and enters quickly
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those where the flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite, that is to say because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or a fall, and the humerus is displaced by the swelling, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to examine it until you are certain of its displacement, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	It is recognized as displaced when it comes down to the lower part of the chest: and you must distinguish between a displaced humerus and a healthy humerus
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For indeed you will find among them a diverse manifestation, and you will find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the thumb there is a swelling as though there were two heads: and you cannot reduce the hand to its natural position, nor move it in any way
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a noticeable bulge, and it is not hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this displacement it is easy to reduce when it is recent, or when it is mild
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it raises the minister's hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	And then place your fingers under the nail of that [affected] limb, and elevate the joint with force upwards to its place: and the minister will raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	And then support it below, for it will quickly return to its place.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return by that which we have said, and if there has been a displacement for several days: then it is necessary to bathe the patient in warm water, and to apply an embolus which will soften and soothe, like decocting wild herbs, barley, and meadowsweet in water, and to administer these things
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	And then the patient is placed upon his back: and under the nail of that limb a sphere and a bandage are placed, which should be equal between leniency and tension.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	And then the physician places his heel upon the sphere, and elevates the arm with force, and pulls the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: and it will return immediately
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if necessary, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make a person stand by the patient who is longer than him, and that he stands at the side, and that he inserts his arm under the patient's nail: and that he elevates the nail upwards until the patient is suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister pulls the patient's hand downwards into his belly
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the patient is limp: then it is necessary to suspend it with something else, so as to make it flexible: for it will return to its place immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in another way: thus it forms in the earth a long stick whose head is rounded like a glove of a hanged man: neither gross nor subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	And then it is placed under the lower part after the upper part of the stick is covered with soft cloth: and the lower part is fixed according to the length of the stick
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	And then the hand is extended downwards from the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is equal to the distance of two arms, and whose width is equal to the distance of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the distance of two fingers: whose head is rounded, so that it may fill the entrance to the depth of the wound, according to this form
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then it is bound over the rounded head with soft cloth, so that it does not harm the stick of the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	And it is placed under the wound of the patient, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick to the lower part: and the stick is bound over the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	And the arm is placed over the step of the ladder for the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is let go from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When it is thus completed the entrance of it is completed according to whatever way is possible: then it is necessary that you place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity to that of wool
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	And then put on a prepared plaster from pounded barley with oil, and white of egg over the whole arm, as it is turned upwards
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten under the thumb the stricture of the decennium: and the ligament will be reversed over the base of the palm: and its hand is connected to its column and let go, neither move its hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary to put nourishing food to the patient until the limb be comfortable: for it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then put on a wider dressing after seven days, or five, and take it off when moved.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the suture is displaced many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary to administer in it cautery with three holes, as it is stated in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If you do all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture is not firm, and you reduce the palm and the stricture above it somewhat, and it does not harden, and it falls off, and it is not able to raise itself to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves that are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the suture will never be firm in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for the dislocation which happens towards the breast and the nipple, or to the back, it is done by impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and cautery is administered in the rest of the stricture and care, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after the healing there remains greatness in the limb, and tardiness in its motion: then the patient is treated with many baths, until the greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the Cubitus.
Caput XXVIII.	Cubitus dislocation treatment
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the cubitus joint is easily dislocated and returns with difficulty: and that it is also prone to dislocation in all parts, and above all to the front or to the back
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not hidden: for it hangs loose under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubitus with the sound limb, it becomes evident.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	It is joined together again, and the arm cannot be doubled over, nor can it be touched with the other arm
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must, in order to be expedient, reduce the dislocation immediately before a callous swelling forms on it
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a callous swelling forms on it, its reduction becomes difficult: and it may not heal at all, especially when it is at the back
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For every kind of dislocation is harmful, and causes great pain: and it descends with great speed with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible is to extend the limb with two hands: and the arm should be spread out, and the hands of the physician should be placed above the elbow and below it, and he should push with his thumbs together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front: then it returns in such a way that the hand is doubled with the other hand, until it comes into contact with the root of the palm of the dislocated cubitus
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not yield to reduction, then administer violent extension, with force: and extend the arm with two attendants: and let them hold it firmly even, so that it does not move during the extension
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is returned to its entire extent after it has been bent over the hand, and a doubled long band or a wide ligament is passed over it.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor grasps the hand with his grasp, let him moisten it with oil: so that this be from the things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he drives the joint forward with a pushing movement until it returns
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place upon it a dressing, in which there is styptic action, and drying with alum or white of egg: and the structure is to be tied down appropriately.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is suspended from the collar of the patient: and it is left for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is healed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, however, the joint remains fixed in its place, then solve the ligament from it and leave it alone
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you have not properly tied down the joint, then repeat the dressing and the ligament and leave it alone for a few days until it is properly tied down
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it is healed.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there is still some degree of pain after the reduction of the joint, and the position is painful: then administer moisture in a bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the pain subsides, or put a poultice over the joint, that is, a piece of fat from a sheep's tail
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and it is left for a day and a night
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away the dressing, and put it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is wet, then gently friction the joint.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat above the same limb twice, and the third time with the bath inside until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if desired, put above the same limb a cushion of fat, moistened, warmed with butter, and bind over it.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do it quickly.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it itself is softened and returns to its natural position.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	(End of excerpt)</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	When the limb is moved too violently, the dislocation occurs, that is, the fracture between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.</start_of_turn
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the rest of the fractures.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Indeed it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of the dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it is fixed in its place: or else it happens that in this fixing the limb is made worse.</start_of_turn
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of Mahassem on a board and extend the hand: and the doctor places his palm on the prominence of the fracture and urges it until it returns.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Indeed it is necessary to consider, if the palm has receded towards the inside of the limb: then the patient places the back of his hand on the board along with the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the limb, then let the position of the limb be inside the board, that is, the inner side of the limb is placed on the board, so that the doctor's hand rests on the prominence of the fracture.</start_of_turn
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind up the part with a settling plaster and discharge it, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, neither can you perform a further reduction of it, after which days have passed, for indeed a suture will remain according to its nature: and it does not harm the patient anything, except that it makes the hand softer, and you cannot bind anything: then you know that the nerve is severed, or that the tissue is injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no wisdom in it, except to bind it with cautery close to its base.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it will cause no further harm.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When the soul does not return, then place over it a settling plaster, as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	And bind it up, and discharge it after five days: afterwards it is dissolved and discharged, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its motion is hindered, and something heavy has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction, until it is softened
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	(End of excerpt

Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the Finger is dislocated from its socket to every part, or from the palm of the hand to the wrist, or its bone: then extend the Finger and push the dislocation gently with your thumbs, until it returns
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the Finger, and suspend it over the part from which it is dislocated, and discharge it in two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night falls, bind the limb according to its own narration: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and move it with effort: and bind it again at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this every few days until it is bound together again
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	Do the same with the hand if it is dislocated downwards: bind it to the same part, and do the operation as you did at the first time, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	Do the same in every case of dislocation
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Regarding the treatment of a dislocation of the shoulder joint.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When anyone has a dislocation of the shoulder joint, or a complete dislocation of the collarbone, or many of the spinal bones are displaced from their places: then it is not in this treatment that the sea is useful for the sick person
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sickness goes out without being willing, and that he cannot keep it: and many times they soften some part of his limb, or two arms, or two legs, or one of them: or they displace one of the spinal bones from its place
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times they displace them, because many times they cause a dislocation to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	The one which they displace towards the back is called a gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for this is, if the gibbosity happened in infancy: then it is not in this treatment, and there is no healing from it at all
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in whatever case it happens, whether by a blow or a wound or in some similar way, as the ancients said in a long speech about the old methods of treatment
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	Whoever has learned much does not return to the beginner's level
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the cavity in the wall from which we have spoken, which is close to the patient, is the place where the edge of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well, until the spine is firm, and then return to your place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the knee which is involved with your hand: and it is that two boards should be placed under the patient’s feet, their length being equal to the thigh; and two boards should be placed under the head of the patient’s foot in the last part of the foot
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length which is between all the boards is equal to the palm of one hand: and thus it is made in every place where there is a hole through which the knee runs: and fix all the boards firmly to the ground so that they do not move at all
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round bar: and it is the knee through which the ligament is twisted in two holes of the two boards.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole in which the board is fixed, whose length is equal to the palm plus that which is twisted: and in two other boards it is like this
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And tighten the ligaments which you have strung in the patient’s chest around the knee which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have strung in his thighs around the knee which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then remain at every knee which is ministering, who twists his hand with the bandage, with which the knee is twisted: and the physician must equal the spine, as we have said
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the knee which follows
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, it is necessary to apply an ointment of desiccated plaster with albumin.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place upon the plaster a bandage of the width of three fingers, or somewhat more
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be such as to cover the area of Gibbositatis and above the healthy part of Spondilis
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament we mentioned
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient is kept nourished with delicate food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains swollen in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the administration of plaster as we have mentioned previously for a long time
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And in that place is administered a layer of lead
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that the prominence at the last part of Spondilis of the back: and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to assume for it any medicine: perhaps because of that it may cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the treatment of a dislocated Anchae.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter two.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the ligatures of the Anchae, and of the humerus, do not happen except for a complete dislocation: neither does it happen except for a slight displacement and a concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the Anchae is done according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Many are displaced inwards: few towards the front, and few towards the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of such displacement inwards is: because when you join the limb of the sick with that of the healthy, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick is more prominent than that of the healthy, and the sick man cannot double his foot at the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle after the heel has gone is that where the head of the thigh comes.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of such displacement outwards is that there are injuries contrary to these injuries
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of such displacement towards the front is that it expands the healthy limb along its course: but indeed it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go beyond that without pain: and he retains his urine and his heel is swollen, and there is a swelling at walking on the ankle
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of such displacement towards the back is that it does not expand the knee, and that he cannot double it before he doubles the ankle: and his limb is even shorter than the other: and his ankle is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the hip bone.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this kind of displacement is that you should join together again what has been separated for a long time, which has become callous with age.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you have administered the reduction, and it remains in its proper position: then there is no longer any ailment in that matter
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not right therefore that an imputation should be made to him of malice aforethought.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that case where the displacement is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of displacement: then it is proper in this case to wish to join together, and to extend it inwards and outwards, and to move it to the right and to the left: perhaps then it will return, and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If he does not return in this way, it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister and extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament which is bound above his knee. And another minister extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tighten with a soft ligament above the root of the thigh and keep the end of the other ligament taut.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And extend it either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the hip bone, or from the posterior part to the part of the back
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be all at once, until the patient rises with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is a common species of extension of four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If he therefore returns dislocated as we have said, that is good: and if not, then it is necessary to use all these methods which we have mentioned for treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction, however, of itself when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient be placed over his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put a ligament above the root of the thigh, on the part between the head of the thigh and the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip bone
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then take another strong minister of his arm and press the lower part of the thigh and extend outwards the extension which we mentioned before
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the easier method of all those methods for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he excuses himself from thee, and doth not obey thy order to enter with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary, that two feet of the sick man be bound together with a strong, soft ligament, over two calcanei, and over two knees: and let the length of each be as much as four fingers; and let the diseased limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the diseased limb is suspended upon the head of the ligament, which is in the groin: and let its length be as much as the quantity of two arms from the ground
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong youth to bind the hip: and suspend the limb with the youth: and the youth shall push with force, bending the hip with force, for the bandage will return to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its return, when there is displacement outwards, it is necessary that the sick man lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over his thigh, the diseased limb itself, and over his breast.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then is placed a board added in the middle of the foot, fixed well: upon which are bound wet cloths, so that it does not hurt the sick man: and let the board be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards with extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let all the attendants go to their places, and the physician will equal the reduction by his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon his own table, and press it down, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	The patient must lie with the affected side upwards.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb quickly: and it is in accordance with this that the physician places his right palm on the heel of the patient
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he grasps it with the other hand, and when he has closed it, he extends the limb downwards to the knee
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backwards: then it is not necessary to extend the limb downwards, but rather to elevate it above the ground: indeed it is necessary to place it on a firm support, as it is also done when the dislocation is wide outwards, as we said concerning its recumbent position on two cushions: and it is upon its face and the stretched ligament: as we said above.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary to apply a compress also with a board upon the place from which the joint has been displaced, when the reduction is complete, as is necessary
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend both legs of the patient: and when you remove them equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without groaning: then you know that the limb has returned, as is necessary: then join together the two thighs, and apply a bandage, and bind as before, that is, with a rotation: so that it does not move outwards to any part: and the patient must rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the bandage, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation has been definitively reduced: absolutely therefore you may allow the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then rest, and reapply the bandage, and bind it as before: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then heal it and make it tardy in its walking over both sides for a few days until it is comfortable.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Until it is comfortable.
Caput XXXIII.	Until it is comfortable.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	There are three ways in which the knee is dislocated.</start_of_turn>
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, or downwards, that is to the back.</start_of_turn
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	It is not dislocated forwards.</start_of_turn
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	Its sign is that the patient holds his limb away from his body at the knee.</start_of_turn
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If, however, it does not move with the knee, then you know that the knee is dislocated.</start_of_turn>
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all these cases of dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can extend his limb over it, and place his heel against its face: and place his foot between his feet.</start_of_turn
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then hold the knee with your palms and keep it straight between your fingers over the knee.</start_of_turn
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply two fingers of your palm on both sides of the knee with force.</start_of_turn
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.</start_of_turn
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of recovery is that the limb adheres to the knee without pain.</start_of_turn
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it and make the limb adhere to the knee.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it like this for three days, or four.</start_of_turn
Deinde solue ea.	Then solve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	Then solve them. And let not the patient remain ambulatory for a few days before he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, he resists reduction, then manage the extension of force with ligaments, as has been mentioned previously in the treatment of an abscess, until it returns
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Until it returns.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.</start_of_turn>
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus sometimes returns with a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its completeness.</start_of_turn>
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is done either inwards or outwards.</start_of_turn
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel is swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is dislocated.</start_of_turn
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy restoration: it is to extend it gently with the hands, and to equalize, until it returns.</start_of_turn>
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of its dislocation according to its completeness, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and hold him firmly with a strong hand from the back of his back, in the middle of him.</start_of_turn
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take your hand with your right hand the foot from the upper part of it, and with your hand with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle level.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand with two fingers.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left hand, and push forward the heel of the foot with the right hand without straining.</start_of_turn
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do it twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then drive the heel of the foot to the knee in the third space, and you pull the [ligament] out.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns once in the space, or twice according to this manner, and you equal the foot, that is good: and if not, then do the operation again above it: because it will return itself
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is prohibited to you to reduce it as we have said: then make the patient lie on his back on the earth, and fix the heel firmly to the earth below, so that it lies between his thighs: and you will encircle the limb above it, so that it does not damage the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of his heel: afterwards extend the other limb, either with your hands or with the ligament which is above the ankle bone
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of the counterpart: and the heel will be fixed between the thighs of the patient, retaining it so that it does not draw the body towards the lower parts during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician will equal the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb will hold the sound limb towards the lower parts
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the reduction is complete: then put on a plaster and bandage, and bind up the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the ankle bone.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware of nerves, which are above the posterior heel, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that they do not suffer damage
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let it go in two or three days
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day. Prohibit the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there will be no security that it will be dissolved without causing further dislocation, and it will be corrupted, and will not be cured afterwards
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there is a stiff swelling: then it is necessary to manage it in its quiescence in that place where our story proceeded elsewhere in the cure, and to embolize it, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and its treatment.

Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to equalize what is dislocated with little extension without labor: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some part of the ankle: then it is necessary to make the patient sit with the foot resting on the same level as the ground, or on a board: and he should be able to walk like a normal person
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then sit down, and place your foot on that which is above those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then clench your foot with your foot until it returns, and let the swelling subside, and you will find it equal, and it will not appear in the place of prominence
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the foot of him a board that can support the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a bandage for three days
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is secured and protected from reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of this kind happens, and you desire its cure and restoration, many things follow in its wake: and because of this it is not right to anticipate over its cure, which is of this kind, except for one who is prudent in the art of long-lasting remedies, merciful, pious, tardy, not audacious, neither presumptuous: and as the physicians sit in the aftermath of a hot bath, they do not depart without giving an order concerning the patient.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except that you know or hope for salvation from perdition with the gentleness of adversity, and in which something of hope appears
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	To attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a cold abscess forms
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb returns, as we wish, then manage the abscess: and care for the wound with the things that suit it from the desiccant unguents.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and they are separated from each other in the bone, then attempt to remove them, and do in this what we said in simple ailments concerning the places where they are located
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your ability, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has been predicted to you by me
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For better is your prayer to your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body in your time than all the physicians of the world
