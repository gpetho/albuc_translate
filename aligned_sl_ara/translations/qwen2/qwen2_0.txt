He who wrote this book, when he had provided you with my sons, this book that is a part of the science in medicine with its completeness and where its aim has been reached from its clarity and explicitness, I saw it necessary to complete it for you through this article which is a part of practical work.
Because working by hand is improved in our country and in our time, it's completely absent; even if it was studied as a science and its influence had vanished. Only a few small illustrations remained in the original books, which were scribed by hand, and their reality was error and confusion until their meanings were distorted and their benefits faded.
I saw that I should revive and write this article in the way of explanation, clarification, and conciseness. Also, I would provide images of various devices and other tools for work as it is an increase in elucidation and a resource needed.
The reason for this is that there are no skilled craftsmen with their hands in our time, because the production of medicine takes a long time and it should be expected that its possessor needs to have knowledge of anatomy, which Galen described. So that he can understand the benefits of organs, their structure, mood, connections and disconnections, knowing bones, nerves, muscles, their number, outlets, veins, arteries, sinuses, and places of their outlets.
Therefore, the uninitiated say that doctors by name are many but in reality few, especially in manual craft. We have mentioned this from our side at the introduction of this book.
For he who is not aware of what we have mentioned about anatomy, he will inevitably fall into a mistake that kills people as I have seen many who have misconceived in this science and claimed it without knowledge or acquaintance.
And I have seen a physician who, in his ignorance, cut into a pig's fat tumor on the neck of a woman. He severed some of her neck arteries and bled out her blood to death right before him.
And I have seen another physician who advanced in extracting a stone from a man whose prostate had been pierced. The stone was large and he panicked, but he removed it with a piece of the bladder tissue. The man died around three days later, and I had been called upon to extract it. I saw the size of the stone and the condition of the urine passage, which was worse than what I could have imagined.
And I have seen another physician who used to earn his living among some of our local leaders in medicine.
And it happened to a black boy who had broken his leg near the knee, with an injury. The doctor, acting impulsively, tightened the break on the wound using splints and ligatures too tightly, leaving no breathing room for the injury.
Then he indulged him with his pleasures, then left him for days and ordered that the bandage not be removed until his leg swelled and his foot suffered imminent demise.
And I called him, and he hurried to remove the bandage, allowing him relief from his sufferings. He was able to recover from his pain, but decay had already set deeply within the limb, and I could not eradicate it.
And the decay continued to spread within the limb until it resulted in death.
And I have seen another physician who treated a malignant tumor, which began to erode after days until it became large in its owner. It turns out that if cancer is of a black mixed hue, it should not be exposed purely to iron.
Except if it's a member that could require the removal of all of it.
Thus, my children, it is necessary for you to know that work with the hand divides into two: work accompanied by safety and work that often encounters difficulty in most cases.
And everywhere this book mentions work that involves risk and fear, it should warn you and discourage you from it.
So that the ignorant do not find a path to criticism and objection, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and in your treatment be gentle and persistent.
And use the best path leading to safety and commendable outcome, conquer the dangerous and easily deceiving diseases.
And cleanse yourselves from anything you fear might cast doubt upon your faith and worldly affairs; it is better for you in this world and the hereafter due to your capabilities.
And as Galen said in some of his instructions, do not cure evil diseases; instead, call yourselves doctors of evil.
And this article has been divided into three sections or doors.
The first door.
In the first door, knowledge about lighting the fire and the hot instrument, organized from the ancient times to now. Images of tools, knives, instruments for cautery, everything needed in working with hands.
The second door.
In the second door, there is knowledge about incisions, puncturing, dissections, bloodletting, surgeries and removing arrows among other things. Everything is organized and illustrated with images of the tools.
The third door.
In the sections of reduction and removal, treatment of the hernia, and similar organized procedures from ancient times to modernity, along with illustrations of the instruments.
The first door.
In the city.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to describe the way of its benefits and drawbacks, as well as in what mood it is used.
I will say that discussing the manner of benefiting from wine and its drawbacks is a long, detailed, and secretive subject; scholars have spoken about it.
There was disagreement among them on this topic, and I have shortened their brief words to avoid lengthening the explanation.
I will say that wine benefits in general for every bad mood, with or without a substance, and there are two types of such moods: the hot mood without material substance, and the dry mood without any material substance.
As for the dry mood with substance, they differed in it. Some said that wine is beneficial in this case, while others argued against this saying that wine should not be suitable in a disease characterized by heat and dryness because fire's nature is heat and dryness.
It's impossible to cure a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. The one who argues against this says that wine, when used with fire, can be beneficial in curing a hot dry illness that occurs among people's bodies. Because if you added the human body and its moisture to the fire's mood, it would cool down the human body.
And I say according to his statement because experience has shown me this several times, that it is not fitting to conceive of this matter except for someone who has experienced and explored the realm of wine. This is about stopping on the differences in people's moods and conditions within themselves, causes of illnesses, their symptoms, and the duration of time for these.
As for other moods, you have nothing to fear from them, especially cold and wet illnesses; all the physicians agreed upon it and there was no disagreement about its benefits in garlic.
Know this, my children, that there is an advantage to treatment with fire compared to treatment with burnt medicine; because fire is a singular substance whose action does not extend beyond the organ it affects and does not harm another connected organ except for minimal damage.
Treatment with burnt medicine can extend its effects beyond the organ and may cause disease in the organ that is difficult to cure, or it might kill; but fire, due to the honor and generosity of its substance, does not do this unless it was overused.
We have become clear on this through experience, due to our long service and attention to craftsmanship, as well as standing by the truth of affairs.
And that's why I avoided lengthy exposition, even though it might not be fitting for my book, I did tell you about the secrets of fire and its workings in bodies, and how to refute illnesses through philosophical arguments that would resonate with your understanding.
Know this, my children, that they (the scholars) have differed regarding the time when garlic should be used and considered spring to be the best season for it.
And I say that garlic can be used at all times, as the harm caused by time gets absorbed in the benefit that comes from garlic. And especially so if the garlic is a necessary strong torment that can't be delayed, as what fears is that it might follow by an even worse affair than the damage caused by delay.
Do not let it occur to you, my sons, what the common people and the foolish physicians imagine about a disease that never recurs after its cure and blame it unnecessarily.
Neither should you think that it's just about the cure which merely acts as a mood regulator and dries up the dampness being the cause of pains.
Except that the cure is preferred over medicine due to its speed of effectiveness, power of action, and strength of its influence.
Yet, the disease may return at a certain time depending on the patient's mood and the capability and strength of their illness, as well as what accumulates within his body from excesses and neglecting himself in acquiring foods and so forth, among other causes.
Oh Lord, let the disease that the cure deals with be a mild one and in an organ with little excesses or dampness. Similar to how the pomegranate relieves pain, and so on, it might not return that pain, which would be at least minimal.
As for the common people's claim that the cure is the end of medicine, it's a correct statement not against what they think because they believe there is no cure that benefits from medicine or anything else after receiving the cure. The situation contradicts their belief.
The meaning of "the cure is the end of medicine" simply means that when we tried various treatments for a disease and none of those medicines worked, then we used the cure which did work. From here, it follows that "the cure is the end of medicine". Not on the meaning to which the general public and many uneducated physicians have come.
I have mentioned at the beginning that gold is better than iron for application. They said this due to the balance of gold and its noble essence, they also stated that it does not tarnish the area where it's applied, which is completely untrue.
For I have tried it and found that this works differently on different bodies. The application with gold is better and more effective than iron, as they said. However, if you protect the pan from gold in fire, you might not be able to determine when it reaches the heat level desired for reddening the gold.
And because it accelerates the cooling process; if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in fire. And by doing so, the craftsman will be distracted due to this. Therefore, iron application has become faster and more accurate for work, may God willing.
This section on application has been organized in chapters from head to foot, facilitating what the student wishes for if God willing.
The first chapter.
In the application to the head, there is one method.
This method is useful for overcoming the effects of moisture and cold on the brain, both of which are causes of headaches and frequent head colds extending to the eyes and ears. It also helps in dealing with excessive sleepiness and toothaches as well as throat pains. In short, for every illness that arises from cold such as fever, epilepsy, fainting and so on.
This method involves first instructing the patient to undergo three or four nights of medicine-induced defecation, which is a remedy for head issues, depending on the strength and age of the patient as well as their routine.
Then command him to shave his head like Moses, then make him stand before you sitting, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the end of your forefinger on the tip of his nostril between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger ends, teach that location with the ink.
Then heat the olive oil lamp which is shown here.
If the bone is as large as the head of a rabbit or as big as an almond, raise your hand and if not, repeat with the hammer itself or another one if it cools down. Until you see the bone as I described, then take a bit of salt and dissolve it in water. Dip a cotton ball into this solution and place it on the spot; leave it there for three days.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in ghee to him until the wound heals from the fire, then heal him with the four-in-one ointment until he recovers if God wills.
And they said that the wound becomes better and more beneficial the longer it stays open, letting pus out.
Some of them advised cauterizing the skin to the bone and keeping the iron on until some thickness of the bone burns. After that, they would remove what burned from the bone and then treat it.
Others suggested that the iron should be used excessively until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing part of it to fall off like charcoal or a small piece of coal. They claimed that steam from the head rises from this place and allows the wound to stay open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals, and I have not seen these two types of heat in everyone. Leaving it with me is better and safer when possible. If the head doubles in size whenever its natural connection splits off, as we've observed in other body parts.
And especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first type of cut that I prefer and recommend you to make, should be made in a way of performing a single cut if God wills.
The Second Chapter.
In it, about the head also.
If a chronic headache occurs in the sentence of the head and it lasts with the illness, use the incisions, punctures, suction, medications, and bandages. And especially if one part of this kind that we described did not benefit him from any of these treatments, then observe. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, but he finds a very severe cold, apply another kind of treatment slightly above that one. Then, apply another kind on each century of his head until the thick skin goes away and reveals the amount of bone that we described. And apply another kind of treatment at the back of his head in the place known as 'the needle', and use gentle force here; do not reveal the bone, for this gives the patient severe pain unlike other treatments on the head. I will describe this kind in its appropriate location.
And the needle that hardens the centuries of the head and its back should be softer than the needle used for the middle part of the head, this is how it looks.
The Third Chapter.
In treating the acute sister (disorder) or condition.
If a headache occurs in the gap of the head accompanied by pain, and this pain extends to the eye, then evacuate the patient using purgative medications for the head. Apply all treatments that I mentioned in sections on diseases if they do not help. In such cases, there are two options for treatment. Either through the use of hot burning medicine and either through iron.
And if it is through the use of burned medicine, then take a garlic clove, peel it and cut off its ends from both sides. Then make an incision in the place of the pain with a wide chopper until there's a space under the skin that can accommodate the garlic clove.
Then it goes under the skin until it disappears. Then pull it tight with bandages tightly tightened, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic clove. Allow two or three days to pass before you resume your activities.
Cover the area with a cotton pad soaked in oil until pus comes out. Then treat it with ointment until you recover, if God wills. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burned medicines that I mentioned in chapter eight of the articles on burned medicines.
And if it is through iron, like this description: cover the iron with its image:.
And the nail-making iron is named so because its head resembles a nail, having some curvature at its tip and it has a small notch in the middle.
Then place it on the spot of pain, hold your hand, and turn the file a little at a time. The amount that burns through the skin should be like half of its thickness. Then lift your hand to avoid burning the vessel below, which could cause bleeding. Then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then cover the cotton with oil, then treat it with ointment until you recover if God wills.
If you wish, remove this injury with the blade of the hammer's tool and avoid cutting the vessel in this non-chronic case specially.
The Fourth Chapter.
In this lies the chronic injury.
If you treat the chronic injury with the advanced treatment we have mentioned and the sections on diseases, but the treatment does not work and you find a cause that cannot be achieved by what we have described as the first medicine or the second by fire. You should protect the hammer's blade so that it becomes white after you practice on the site of pain in a line about half an inch long or roughly so, and leave your hand once when you pull it until you cut the vessel and reach close to the bone.
However, you should avoid touching the moving jawbone during chewing as it may burn or damage the muscle or nerve that moves it causing twitching.
Be cautious and watchful for bleeding from the vessel you cut; there may be risks in cutting it. And especially for those who were unaware of what to do and had no experienced guide, leaving the task undone is better.
And I will mention measures for dealing with unexpected bleeding from the vessel on its face in its place in the book if Allah willing, and I see a cause that this method cannot achieve.
I saw that the body of the poor is able to tolerate a hole kind in the middle of the head as we described, and treated the wound until it heals if Allah wills.
And if you wish, you can use the instrument we mentioned in the section on treating vessels with a hammer equipped with two blades; it is a better and more effective method.
The Fifth Chapter.
In this chapter, there are ear pains.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and all other treatments mentioned in this part, but if the pain persists, increase the heat of the point which is described as being where the picture is shown.
Then, after warming it around the entire ear or both ears as it turns around them if the pain is in both. And remove a little from the base of the ear after you have learned its position with the reed, and let there be about ten points in each ear or close to it. Then treat all the places until God willing they are healed.
The Sixth Chapter.
In this chapter, there is strength.
The strength that is treated with oil, as it should be of the type that produces phlegm, as explained in sections on diseases.
And one should avoid oil of the type that causes dryness and neuralgia.
If this type of strength was treated with leeches, cat plasters and fumigations but did not relieve the condition, it would be necessary to apply three oils. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the lobe, and the third at the tip where both lips meet.
Make your oil against the sick side, for relaxation only occurs in the right direction.
The picture of the oil should be that it is applied across the top part of the ear below the forehead slightly, and another one in the lobe; its length should match the length of the nose.
Lower your hand until the tip of your finger burns as much as half the thickness of the skin, this is a depiction of an awl, it's a type of surgical knife whose image has been advanced by a slight degree compared to it. It should have a slightly hard sharpness in the knife, then treat the affected area with what has been mentioned to purify it if God wills.
The Seventh Chapter.
In the case of chronic atony.
If the atony is confirmed and treated as we have instructed, but if your treatment does not improve and it's not due to a fever lasting four days. On each end of his head, there should be one incision on the forehead as we have mentioned, and one on the back part of the head according to what has been described.
The recipe for the awl, as described previously, it may also include an incision on the mouth of the stomach to be more effective. Then treat with what has been described.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the case of forgetfulness.
The one affected by phlegm, it is necessary to irrigate with the thick fluids or first from the larger sinuses and purified cerebrospinal fluids.
Then shave his whole head and place on his back a gauze pad written about in the article on bandages, carrying it for as many times as needed since this is one form of treatment.
And do it on the same level you mentioned there, if he recovers from this treatment; otherwise, make three incisions at the back of his head, they should be set in a line from the top of the head down to the base of the neck.
Make the interval between each operation very tight, then treat the operation with what has been mentioned. If you want to increase it and if that is plausible, puncture the middle operation.
If you want to increase the treatment, puncture both bones then treat until healing occurs, and make the cast oily based on the previous image.
The ninth chapter.
In applying the splint and relaxing all the body.
It is necessary to proceed in cleaning the head with aloe vera and what we mentioned, then shave the head of the patient. Then puncture an operation in the middle of the head, one operation on each bone of the head, and one operation at its end.
And three on the throat depressions. If you need more for relaxing the body due to an illness and if the patient is suitable for it, and the disease is strong and persistent, puncture four operations on the thoracic depressions. Notify the operation until it burns more of the skin and raise your hand, then treat it as previously described until recovery if God willing, and make the cast oily.
The tenth chapter.
In treating epilepsy.
Only the epileptic who experiences seizures due to phlegm needs treatment. It is necessary to first cleanse his brain with large aloe vera and other treatments we have mentioned in this section, if possible for the patient to take medications.
If, however, it's a child who can't tolerate medicines, they should use the brain cleaners and gargling with oils for a long time before that, while improving their nutrition.
Then he shaves his head and then cuts the single incision in the middle of the head as described previously, and another incision at its rear. Every century of his head is cut with an incision, if the patient is strong and likely to recover, cut all the incisions that are mentioned in the falaj manual, rest the body on the cervical vertebrae and spinal vertebrae, and ensure the dressing is oil-based according to the previous instructions.
If it's a child who needs treatment, make the dressing gentle as per this image.
The eleventh chapter.
In the incision of malenkholia.
If the cause of malenkholia is diseased moisture and thick phlegm, cut as described in the falaj manual.
If the cause of malenkholia is a preference leaning towards black and if the patient's body is excessively moist, cleanse his mind as described in the section.
Then shave the head of the patient, then make a tight wad from cotton like a circle, and place it in the middle of his head. The patient should be sitting upright, touching all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on a medium hot fire as much as the finger can tolerate if inserted, then pour it into the center of his head inside the circle and leave him until it cools. Do this to the patient every week with all other good practices until he is cleansed may Allah have mercy.
And if you wish, make its points small and numerous without touching the dressing with your hand, but just let it smolder. This type of incision moistens the brain moderately.
Then it is girded with cotton dipped in oil or chicken fat.
The second chapter.
In which the descending water is in the eye.
If you observe the beginning of water descending in the eye according to the signs mentioned earlier, act immediately. Cleanse his head and body from all moisture, bathe him in lukewarm water for several days.
Then once, shave his head and make incisions in the center of his forehead. Then make two incisions on each jawbone if water starts to descend in both eyes or from only one side if it's in just one eye.
Then, with the tweezer, cut all the veins and arteries beneath the skin. The incisions should be long in proportion to the width of the jawbones, and take care not to bleed excessively.
If you see anything loose, cut it where it is with whatever treatment you can and we will come to the wisdom in severing the arteries and stopping bleeding.
And it may be necessary to make two deep incisions under the cheekbones.
The thirteenth chapter.
In cases of chronic watering eyes.
If the tears from the eye are chronic and constant, having occurred through the veins and arteries on the forehead's surface both inside and outside of the head, and you ascertain that it is due to thick cold mucus. Then make the incision as described for water beginning in the eye at the start of the treatment. Make an incision in the center of the forehead and two on each jawbone. Make two under the cheekbones beneath the bones as well. If you need more, make a small incision on each side of the eye's tip on the eyebrow with tweezers.
Chapter Fourteen
In how to remove the nose.
If the treatment with what we have mentioned in this section did not improve his condition, then immediately use a fast and effective remedy for three nights. Then shave his head and apply the middle-sized poultice using an oil-based mixture. Then apply two rounds with the piercing needle above the temples, under the hair a little bit, while being careful not to cut the vein. This is an illustration of how to use the piercing needle.
Chapter Fifteen.
In how to relax the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, apply a poultice once with this helical needle on the eyelid.
And if you wish, apply two poultices a little above each temple, spaced from the cheeks, with each poultice along the length of each eyebrow.
Do not overdo it with the poultice, but only up to what burns a third of the skin. This is how the needle should be applied in this manner.
Chapter Sixteen.
In applying to the eyelid.
If her lashes turn inward and irritate her eye, there are two types of poultice for that. Either by fire poultice or with burned medicine poultice, if it is a fire poultice you would instruct the patient to stop their eyelashes growth before this process until they grow long and equal.
If her lashes move when they grow, you would tie her eyelids with a cord so she can't move them until they grow and become even. Once they have grown and are equal in length, place the patient's head on a stone then draw on the eyelid with a stick to mark it as an illustration of an 'as' leaf shape.
The starting sign is near the anus. Then, place a cotton ball moistened in the albumen of egg or in saliva under the eyelid. Then, heat it according to this description.
Then, continue as you were taught little by little in many trials until the skin surface burns. The form of this resembles a full flush of an Ace of Spades card, particularly and specifically with its sign showing health is when you see the eyelid has turned red, and the hair has risen from under the eyelid.
When that happens, raise your hand and leave him for three days. Then, carry out a cotton ball with fat until the scales come off, then treat it with lotion until he heals if Allah wills. If some hair comes back after a while and relaxes the eyelid.
Reapply the treatment in that area as you did initially. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, pluck it until it returns to its natural position, and do not let any eyelashes grow. As for the treatment with burned medicine, it involves asking the practitioner to leave the irritation until it grows longer and becomes even.
Then, make a picture of an Ace of Spades from paper. Take some common soap and some unquenched tallow from each one, weigh them to about a dirham or so, grind them all together finely and do this with the pestle lest they dry out. Then, spread it on the paper you made in the form of an Ace of Spades and place it on one or two eyelids. Place a cotton ball moistened with egg white under the eye, and keep the practitioner's head supported by your shoulder.
Place your index finger on the medicine and press it gently. Move it whenever you feel the practitioner feeling a pleasure in the smell of the medicine, as he finds pleasure in it like fire. If he continues to find this pleasure, leave the medicine alone while moving it with your finger. Once the pleasure subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, for you will see that the lid has risen as it rises when heated with fire or cuttings. Otherwise, renew him with medicine at the spot where the medicine had not worked until your task is completed and the eye has healed by blanching. Then place cotton soaked in wax on him until the burn sloughs off.
Then treat him with the snail ointment or another, until he is cured. It's advisable in your work to be extremely cautious that nothing of medicine falls into the eye. If the lid relaxes after a few days and we dread some hair may fall into the eye.
Then renew the medicine on that spot where the lid has relaxed especially as you did initially, then treat him until he is cured. This is a thorn paper leaf.
Know that people's eyes may differ in smallness and greatness, so according to that, let your treatment be, and it is not hidden that the right path is clear for him who has a way of this kind of work.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In the cornea that is exposed in the eye socket.
If you treat the cornea with what we have mentioned in the sections of diseases, and if your treatment does not work, then it should be strengthened with this property.
Instruct the patient to place their head on your pillow and hold their head captive between your hands so that it does not move or strike with its head.
Then place a cotton ball dipped in the white of the egg or in saliva from the sperm whale on his eyes. Then heat the iron, as shown in this image.
It should be hollowed out like the shaft of an eagle's feather at one end which has the curvature of the eye, and you may choose for it to be pointed at the other end. It could also be made smooth like a needle; however, this hollow is better for your work if God wills.
Then squeeze the lemon if it is open and let the juice come out, or wring it if it is not open. Then remove its seeds. After that place it on the pincer which should be very strong; hold it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly when pressing near the eye towards the nose so as not to mistake it or disturb the patient, causing you to place the pincer in the eyelid and spoil it. If you reach the bone with the first press, but if not, readjust the pincer once again, if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton to him with butter and treat him with the dried ointment until he heals. If forty days pass and he has not healed, apply the strong medicine until the bone is exposed. Then remove it as will be explained in its respective section if God willing.
Another way of performing a lemon press mentioned by some predecessors, you cut into the place where the lemon is and then put in the same groove a fine cork. This is what it looks like.
Fill it with a weight equivalent to a gold drachma of melted lead. Hold your hand firmly on the cork, smoothly and tightly without moving the patient at all, lest the melted lead spills into his eye. It is advisable to place cotton dipped in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
The lead burns the place of the lemon and heals it in a remarkable way. If the lemon heals with the squeezing we have mentioned and the treatment, otherwise, there is no choice but to use an upthrust through the nose and reinsert the lemon into the nasal passage as will be explained specifically for that section.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the division of lip splitting.
Often, there is a condition of cracking in the lips which is called 'hair'. Especially in the lips of boys, it often occurs. If treatment with what we mentioned in the division did not work, heat up a small surgical blade on this image.
Its interior is on the edge of the knife, then place it carefully with the wheel in the same crack until the tip reaches the depth of the crack. Then treat it with tourniquet until it heals God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
In the treatment of severe inflammation in the mouth.
If an abscess appears at the root of the tooth or in the gum or at the roots of the wisdom teeth, it becomes filled with pus and bursts, resulting in mouth inflammation. If treatment did not work for this condition, it should be necessary to heat up a small metal rod as much as it can fit into the abscess.
Then, a surgeon inserts it into the hole of the abscess and holds your hand until the tool is protected reaches both ends of its cavity. Do this once or twice then treat it with the mentioned treatment afterwards until it heals God willing.
If the material stops and heals, otherwise, it is necessary to expose the area and remove the dead bone as will be explained in its section if God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of the wisdom teeth and relaxed gums.
If the gum has relaxed due to moisture and the wisdom teeth have moved, treating it with medicines did not work. Place the tip of the needle in your stone then heat the small metal rod that you will see after this sentence, put the tube on the root afterwards.
The insertion involves the applicator being placed on a wheel and your hand is held for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the penis, then you raise your hand. Then you repeat the applicator as many times as desired, then the attendant fills the patient's mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and throws it, the moving penis gets fixed while the relaxed tongue intensifies and dries out the stagnant moisture.
The twenty-first chapter.
In the case of pain in the penis.
If the pain in the penis is due to cold or there are worms inside without any response to medical treatment, the wax therein has two possibilities: either by applying wax or by applying heat.
As for the treatment with wax, it involves taking cow's fat and boiling it in an iron pot or a ladle. Then take cotton, twist it on the tip of the rod, dip it into the heated fat, place it on the painful tooth while turning, and hold it until it cools down.
Then repeat it several times until the heat reaches the root of the penis. You can dip wool or cotton into the cold fat and place it on the painful tooth, then put an iron pipe above it so that the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for the treatment with heat (using a pipe of copper or iron inside which there is some resin to prevent reaching the patient's mouth), you should prepare a pipe and have it so that not reaches the patient's mouth from the fire, then heat the tool that will be used in this process and place it on the same tooth. Hold your hand until the tool cools down. Repeat this several times.
If the pain leaves, either on that same day or another, it is advisable in this case to fill his stomach with good tallow, to keep it for an hour and then throw it out. This is the image of the mortar.
Tuck in any direction you like, and on the account that it's possible, this is an image of the tube.
The second and twenty-first chapter.
In the case of pigs.
If the pigs are affected by phlegm and cold liquids, and they do not adapt to ripening through medications, and you want a quick ripening, then heat the empty mortar as shown in this figure which has its ends projected.
The smoke should come out through the other end when you apply it, put it covered on the same tumor once and twice if needed. Keep doing this until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the mortar as large as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and put on it cotton soaked in tallow until what burned with fire disappears. Then treat it with ointment and needles till he heals if God wills.
The third and twenty-first chapter.
In coughing from the throat cavity where breathing is constrained.
If moisture has taken over the bronchiole, especially if this coincides with moodiness and coldness, it is necessary to first evacuate the sputum using medications that facilitate expulsion. Then apply a heating technique in tapping at the base of the vocal cords where it is depressed.
Be careful not to reach the vocal cords with the rod, and do not burn the skin except half. Then apply another heating technique at the joint of the neck near the last long bone where it is dense, and ensure that the mortar is fitted on the condition that has been advanced.
Then he treated him with what was mentioned to advance until he recovers if God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold dampness without fever or phlegm, and if the illness is chronic, then take two pessaries above the second ribs in the soft, empty depressions at the low positions, and another pessary elsewhere in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cork should be shaped like the one described, and if you wish, it can have points made of the type called "point" which was previously illustrated in puncturing earache, and the points are to be thirty or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what was mentioned to advance until he recovers. You can create a cork with three branches like this illustration, and you should hasten the process as you apply it once in one go for three corks. This is the illustration of the cork.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of hernia.
If the shoulder blade protrudes due to slippery dampness or did not settle even when it was pushed back until it becomes a habit of recurring and then it retracts at slightest movement as we observed, it should be that the jawbone should first return. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the correct side. Then lift the skin inside the hernia above using your left hand fingers if the joint has retracted inward.
Then heat the cork with two bulbs, as illustrated here.
The skin remains intact until it penetrates to the other side, resulting in a surgical incision shape of four slashes. It may be made with an implement having three edges, thus forming a six-edged incision at that point, and the edges are on the surface of the area being operated on.
This is an image of the implement with three edges.
And if one adds one more to this number, there become eight slashes. Then, the balls of the incision are salted and punctured with salt, and it is bound tightly with thread. The member must not move at all until it heals. If removal goes up (from the wound), then it very rarely happens like that.
Then scratch above the knee with a single sharp incision or many puncturing slashes. This strengthens the joint and removes moisture, thus healing the wound.
The twenty-sixth section.
In the incision of the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach fever and much wetness until it is removed from its mood, and frequent diarrhea happens to it and it gets treated with various treatments but was not effective. It should then lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, and three incisions should be made. An incision is made under the breast with a length of one finger using a needle-like implement, and two slashes are made below each side of this single incision until the shape of the incisions resembles a triangle. There should be space between them so they don't meet when healing, and the depth of the incision is to reach one third of the thickness of the skin, with the shape of the incision being such.
As per this image and this amount without any increase.
If you want to strengthen its position with one large tie on the middle of the stomach like this.
And the plumb bob hanging from this single knot should be in the shape of a circle like this.
And the stomach may be pricked with a point for someone who is suffering from this illness, which is that you should puncture the stomach with a point according to what you desire with your hand, then fasten it with a pointed plumb bob and treat it with the treatment that you recommend until it heals.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In the case of cold liver damage.
If the liver has been revealed and is in pain due to coldness, dampness, or a noxious wind that has caused it to deviate from its natural mood into excessive deviation. Treatment with what we have mentioned in the division did not help. The ill person should lie on his side and with his hand learn to tie three knots in this shape and amount precisely onto the liver below the ribs where the end of the human body meets.
Following each knot, there should be a knot with the thickness of a finger. The knot should be straight along the body's length and do not touch your hand with the plumb bob indeed.
And let the amount of what you burn from thick skin be half its measure, no more. The ill person should stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, he should lie down extending his legs and raising his arms. This is how the plumb bob looks.
And you can tie these knots with the scissor plumb bob if you have skillfulness and precision in craftsmanship, be cautious not to focus on the knot so as to burn all the skin completely, reaching the abdomen and eventually the intestines. The skin there is thin; know this.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of a liver tumor with the gallbladder.
If there is an excretion in the liver and you want to know whether that tumor is within the liver or in its capsule, then if it is within the liver, it would find the evidence heavy and sharp without intensity.
If it is within the liver's capsule, then there would be intense pain and I have seen that doctors had failed to cure it. It would be necessary for him to rest on his elbow, then learn about the affected area with a hot needle.
Then heat the millstone in fire, which is the kind of millstone that resembles this one here. Rub it on once until the whole skin burns and the gallbladder reaches to its exit, until all the bile comes out. Then treat it with remedies for bleeding disorders until he heals.
This kind of gallbladder should not be used except by one who has mastered the art of medicine and these diseases have been treated with experimentation on his hands multiple times, hence he can perform such a task and leaving it to me is better.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of stone in the gallbladder.
I mentioned the first stone with the origin of the cold stone procedure on this condition: take one long, dry reed from the roots of the reeds, as long as you can find and is as thick as a finger. Then immerse it in oil and hold it over fire. Then rub one ball between the connection of the neck and chest, two small balls slightly tilted towards the area below the beard, and two large ones above the breasts, in the area between the third and fourth ribs.
Two ribs also lie between the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae, slightly inclined towards the back. Another rib is in the middle of the chest, and another one above the stomach. There are three more ribs behind one, between the shoulders, and two on either side of the spine below the rib that lies between the shoulder blades.
It is not good to dig deep into the rib, but there should be a palpable trace on the skin. Some first authors have mentioned that some people use an iron tool resembling a nail which they protect and insert between the vertebrae until it reaches the lump itself.
The duration of the period, as we have mentioned in a liver tumor, with this rib pain due to pressure either kills the patient from exhaustion or leaves him in a state of severe discomfort without relief.
Chapter Thirty.
In the liver cyst.
If you treat liver disease with the treatment we mentioned in the previous section and the treatment does not work, there are three aspects of the rib in relation to it; all are correct. One of them is to nail three or four ribs aligned along the length of the liver.
In the form of liver ribs that advance its shape, and there is a width between each rib and each of them equal to or more than the thickness of the finger and sometimes slightly more. The quality of the nail should be the same as what we mentioned in the rib of the liver; do not dig your hand into the rib, and the image of the patient lies on his back.
The second aspect is in the accompanying diagram, where you lift the skin that covers the liver; there it ends at the accompanying fold of the right lung. You also lift the skin covering the liver where the left lung fold ends. Lift your skin across the body width so that the ribs lie along the body length.
Then the two slits are very protected until the skin passes through from the other side. Then, remove the plug; there will be four cuts in total. If you wish, you can use another plug with three grooves instead.
Then treat the area after allowing it to heal for a long time with pus, as it is better than other treatments that have been mentioned.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the case of kidney thirst.
The kidney only benefits in the case of drinking thirst, especially when those suffering from it are treated with various treatments we have mentioned. If your treatment does not help, you should create four kidney areas around the bladder and one on the stomach.
Another kidney on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind his back between the ribs, one in front of his chest and another in front of his stomach. The depth of the kidney should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the kidney open for pus to discharge for a long time.
Do not cease the treatment after kidney insertion until it accomplishes what is necessary for its purpose, hastening his recovery. The image of the plug used to treat the back becomes cylindrical like what was described earlier and is used as a lubricant when treating the back.
The second thirty-first chapter.
In the case of inserting a kidney into the feet and legs.
If they swell in the thirsty person and fill with yellow water, it should be inserted on the back of the foot at the knuckle point between the base joint and the middle joint.
Perform your action with the tongs, do not twist them then raise your hand, do not put it back again, as this causes the yellow water to spill and leaves the tongs in this condition.
Then, sheathe the legs in pairs, two each leg. The sheathing is on the curved edge of the tongs and runs along the leg up to the knee for one section and down from there towards the center of the leg and down to each thigh also in pairs.
Leave the sheath open without treatment for a long time, causing water to leak out from it. Then, treat it with all that we have mentioned.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the case of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture that weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and small intestine, it can be treated with various remedies. If this condition does not improve and if I find that it would benefit from sheathing (as a treatment), then I would apply a large sheath to their stomach. On what has been explained regarding the sheathing of the stomach with a circular tongs, and four sheaths around the navel using the gentle waxy treatment. The sheath is placed on cotton above the tongue that is large or two sheaths.
If I find that there is ample moisture and the body is susceptible to this treatment, sheathe it on the elbow and each rib. Perhaps add two small sheaths to the stomach near the larger one. This is an effective treatment whose benefits cannot fail, if God wills.
The forty-third chapter.
In the case of sheathing for those who sit on stools.
If there are many or one persistent boil in the saddle area, being mixed with thick, cold, sticky substances or rotten fluids, and it has been treated as we have described in the section; if the treatment does not succeed, then pour three quarts of boiling water onto the lower part of the spine under the table in a triangular manner.
A cup under the navel as wide as two fingers, if you estimated that her stomach has cooled down and her food is not being digested, and noticed that she was bloated; then pour a large cup on her stomach following what I've mentioned previously. A cup on her liver as well. Another one on the gallbladder with a needle-sized cup, leave the cup open for some time. Then treat him until he recovers, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the cup of thirst.
After cutting it. If you have cut the testicle, widen the needle that is similar to a needle first, then insert the needle into the same cut of the testicle with your hand until the needle reaches the wound from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If there are many cups, then pour each one like what we described, then treat it with the ointments that suit it until it heals. If its strength is also a large cup, it will be more beneficial in effectiveness on cotton.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In the cup of the sore that occurs in the saddle area and its surroundings.
If the pus does not drain to the cut and refuses the work we described in its place, refusing it might heal by the cup; if such happens with one sore and the pus stops flowing along with the rotten fluids, then you should first compare it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of cutting with the lancet, then warm up the drill that resembles a mill, and insert it halfway inside the sinew at the same angle as the angle of the sinew and the extent which the lancet entered. Continue heating it until all such rotten materials are burned out once or twice or three times according to your need.
And be cautious not to burn the nerve if there is one, or a large artery. If the sinew leads to the bladder organ or to the intestine organ.
Take care of all these areas, but only do so if the sinew is in a position that resembles heat and you estimate that it has not penetrated deeply. Then treat the area until it heals. If the wound closes and materials are no longer coming out from it for some time, know that it has healed perfectly.
And if no materials are coming out from it anymore, know that it has penetrated deep or is in a cavity of a rotten bone or something similar as will be mentioned in its place.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the kidney's heat.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or dense wind and there is a lack of urine production, it should be treated with heating on both kidneys as if for each kidney individually with the drilled reagent that was mentioned. It might require three treatments at the same time table, resulting in three arranged heats which provide better benefits.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the heat of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness until it cannot retain urine, apply heat at the bottom of the groin area over the bladder where the beard hair starts, a heat on the right side of the groin, and another one on its northern side.
Following the cut on each side is to be made according to the width of the indeterminate measurement and the hardness of the knuckle below the back or two if need be, and the mallet should be cylindrical as previously described.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the cut of the womb.
If a cold and damp substance occurs in the womb, it blocks the umbilical cord, spoils its texture and prevents its functionality or if she experiences pain upon its arrival, it is necessary to apply three knuckles around the waist as we mentioned for the kidney. A knuckle on the cotton below the back, or two if needed, and ensure that the mallet is cylindrical.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of hip removal.
Cold fluids might incorrectly reach the right hip, causing it to move out of place. Its sign is that the leg becomes longer than the other when you measure one against the other and finds a space at the location of removal; it is necessary to apply the remedy on the right hip itself in a semi-circular way.
After learning with the ink around the right as it rotates and falls onto the center of the circle, make sure that the mallet you presented its image in the knuckle of the stomach is applied. If this mallet does not satisfy you, use three knuckles with the large oily mallet.
Shape the knuckle in depth according to the thickness of all the skin, then treat it until it heals if Allah wills.
The fifty-fourth chapter.
In which part is menstruation.
If there is pain in the thigh and the cause of this is due to cold and moisture, treated with what we mentioned in the division. If the treatment does not work and if it continues for a long time, then you should make the liquid easier to mix by adding oil of turpentine or oil of myrrh and similar items.
Then burn and position the patient in two ways, either by applying burnt medicines or by fire. The one using fire has many varieties; one of them is to apply three triangular points of heat directly on the thigh itself as shown in this diagram.
And make them deep enough, and after each point, leave a space the size of your finger's thickness. The application should be greasy. You might apply one point in the middle on top of the thigh itself to form four points in total. If you wish, burn with the circle mentioned previously for removing the entire thigh in a single point.
The circle should encircle the entire thigh and completely burn through the skin. This is how to apply a point for menstruation bleeding if the pain is only in the thigh itself and does not extend to the buttock or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, apply two points on the buttock at the spot indicated by the patient's pain. One point above the groin towards the inner side by four fingers width. The application should be sharp and the depth of the point should only go through the thickness of the skin.
And if the pain extends towards the foot as indicated by the patient, apply three to four points with the application of a circle or more if needed based on the pain. If the pain is under the knee and extends towards the leg, apply one sharp point there.
Preserve in all cuts that you do not reach to burning a major nerve or artery; doing so can cause bad or long-lasting harm to the patient.
I have seen two who injured above the knee and passed urine in the cut, so they crippled their leg until the heel was affected and everything got infected. All parts of the body became diseased and then came on with diarrhea and death followed thereafter. If pain occurred in both legs equally, it would exhibit this same condition.
Some of the scholars among the wise have mentioned regarding knee cuts. This is its description; he creates something resembling a pit from iron, with its diameter being half a cubit and it's placed at the mouth akin to the hardness of the tamarind kernel or slightly less than that. Inside this pit, there is another pit, followed by yet another one.
Each pit is located after every pair of kneecaps, with the distance being as long as a fist. The pits are open from both sides and their height goes towards one or two fists. A handle made of iron that is secured in the pits forms its appearance.
Then it is heated in fire until it turns red and throws out the evil. Then, it is placed on the knee joint and patient lies on his correct side, three longitudinal cuts are made all at once with the incisions. It's left for three days, smeared with animal fat, and the wound remains open for days.
Many then, treat it with the ointment until it heals. He wrote that this type of cut was rarely used due to its complexity and intimidating appearance as well as scarcity in those who could endure it. However, for skilled surgeons whose body could withstand the procedure, it was effective when done properly at the right place.
And regarding the use of burned medicines, it is to create two slits similar to a door's hinge where the door hangs from brass or iron.
Within them, there is an elevation of about two decades or approximately so, and the gap between them has the thickness of a finger's knuckle. They have their bottom open and top open; they stick to each other in this form.
Then, place it on the true hip and the prostate while lying on your correct side. Gently lower yourself, then pour between the two rings some hot water that is slightly heated by the fire for about a sand hour measurement. The patient should endure the smell and heat as it feels like fire.
Wait until the pain subsides, then lift your hand with the tool and wipe off the hot water from the entire hip with sweet water. Then leave it for three days and bear the use of fat until the burn fades, leaving him to drain as long as pus comes out; it is more beneficial in effectiveness.
Then treat him with baths until he is cured. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make a mold for it as needed according to what was done for the hip, whether it's larger or smaller. This is the way of hot water and it has been proven in the article about rectifying medicines.
You take half a portion of the Dead Sea salt and non-ashy gypsum from each, then grind them. Place them in a new pot that has one small hole at its bottom, sized enough to let the mixture go through. Underneath this pot you place another flat pan.
Pour sweet water over the Dead Sea salt and gypsum, enough to cover them with a finger after you rub them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the hot water drains at the bottom of the greased pan. Collect all that water then pour it onto another piece of gypsum and another portion of salt, repeating this process again.
When the intensity of pain is very strong, he applies many actions in various medical treatments and on other organs as well. He performs acts akin to fire with it himself; among medications that also subdue knee pain are taffisia, honey from baboon bees, and turmeric mixed with soap.
Galen claimed a story about an ancient man who treated a knee pain and the sweating of women. He praised this method greatly, claiming that it doesn't need any other treatment and that it heals once applied.
Even to the extent that he might carry a person into the bath and they would come out healed, thus taking green saffron if available; in case it was not, dry saffron would be used mixed with a bit of tallow and applied on the painful knee or leg, or thigh.
She should tighten and loosen it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning. Then, they would bathe him when his body smells of the bath water, if he is healed; otherwise, they need to repeat the poultice after ten days again.
He gets healed if Allah wills. Remember, it is not recommended for anyone to use something like these medicines until they have expended their body's energy. Dioscorides also stated that rubbing the milk of goats on women's sweating could benefit them.
The preparation of the poultice is as follows: wool should be taken, soaked in old oil and placed on the deepest part found between the fingers and the thumb, closer to the thumb than the rest. Then take a dry goat's milk.
He heats it with fire until it turns into a lump, then puts it on the wool and leaves it until it goes out. Then take another one; do this until the sensation reaches from the rib to the knee through the treatment area, relieving pain. This type of poultice is called the 'goat milk poultice'.
The Second and Forty-First Chapter.
In the case of back pain.
Back pain may be caused by many factors, either due to a fall, strike, excessive effort and the like. It is produced when cold, moist substance accumulates in this category alone, and back pain falls into this category.
The one that results from the accumulation of cold substance, it should be noted after the excretion of urine, in cases such as the discharge of semen and similar things. The pain tends on his back where the pain consists of three rows across the width of the table itself, after learning the position with the reed in each row five cats or more according to what you see from the likelihood of the urine and its strength.
The cat, when applied to the point of pain, can be three cats or four with a cylindrical pin in this diagram.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the application of the syringe at its beginning.
This reason often occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and movement. You will find at the end of his back bony lumps that have appeared above other lumps.
If you see this and want to stop it, use a syringe that is circular in shape as depicted here. Take the cat on each side of the lump evenly. You can also use the point syringe around the lump in two or three rows, making the points close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as we have described.
And remember not to use the cat in the syringe that comes from muscle spasms.
Chapter forty-four
In chapter about gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold moisture spreading throughout the body to any part of it, if they occur in both legs, doctors usually refer to this as specific gout.
If cold gout, treated with the remedies we mentioned earlier in this section, does not alleviate the pain, then it is necessary to apply something after defecation around both legs. The remedy involves using multiple layers of cloth for wrapping and a medium weight oily paste applied in this manner.
If you need to apply it on the face of the leg, do so with a pimple paste. If the pains rise up to the knees or other joints, and this happens frequently, rub three or four layers from each side around each knee with that same oily paste.
If you need more than this layer, apply it and do not dig deep with your hand in the paste but only to the thickness of the skin. If the pains rise up to the hips or back, use what we mentioned about the paste in that section.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the wrists as if you were weaving two rows. If the pains remain within the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and use a comb on the hand. If after some days the pains move up to the elbows or knees.
Apply them from each side and ensure proper treatment and medication are taken. If the diet is improved and phlegm is expelled, then with this paste, if God wills, he shall be cured.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of tumours.
If a hernia appears in the navel and some of the fat and fatty substance descends to the groin, if this starts soon then it should be ordered that the patient abstains from food for his day, and he should use what expels feces through its cavity.
Then he lies down in front of you on his back, and you command him to hold himself until the lump or fat protrudes. Then you push it with your finger, then you teach yourself with a stick under the hernia on the ilium bone which resembles half a circle whose ends point towards the top of the body.
Then you prepare to describe this image.
Until a white one throws out the evil spirit, then you push back the lump or fat to its cavity. Then a servant puts his hand on the place so that it doesn't protrude. The urine has freed between the legs of the patient and a cushion was placed under him. Another servant ties his legs together.
And the last one on his chest holding his hands, then the mallet is placed on the same mark and your hand guides the mallet upright and straight. Hold it until you reach the bone or do it again if it doesn't reach the bone in the first try.
And protect your effort from the protrusion of the fat while you are hitting him so that it doesn't burn and it causes either death or great pain to the patient. Know that if you didn't reach the bone with the mallet, your operation has not been successful. And ensure that the boys' mallet is soft for their strength, and for adults on their own strength.
Then, the site of the cautery is treated with tallow for three days until the ashes of the fire leave. Then, it is treated with all the ointments until it heals. The patient should lie on his back for forty days until the wound heals.
It is necessary that the food during his treatment period be mild to prevent the protrusion of intestines upon defecation and urination. When he wants to get up after forty days, a tight bandage should be used which should be worn for another forty days. This will help reduce fatigue and overeating from food and drink, as well as severe thirst.
If this measure is carried out as such, God willing, he will be completely cured. I will mention the treatment of scrofula by making a cut in its section if God willing allows it. As for the tumor that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and was in its initial stage, if you want to prevent it from increasing more than its kind according to its capacity. The part of the skin that you burn should be about one third, then treat it with what we have mentioned. If God willing, it won't increase. Some early scholars recommended to strengthen the tumor by a triangular tamping on this shape.
After you learn to work on the tumor with a needle and draw a line across the top of the tumor from side to side, and another one down. When you lower your hand in the middle by making one pinching motion, the first cautery is easier and better if God willing allows it.
The Sixty-Fourth Chapter.
In the cautery of the scrotum.
If there was a fall or blow in some organs causing pain that lasted for a long time and medicine did not alleviate it, it is necessary to strengthen by the point tamping. The cautery should be made according to each organ's size, strength, weakness, and capacity.
He is relieved of the pain and stiffness; he has been freed from the first fever otherwise, he repeats it because according to this practice these pains tend to move from one organ to what is near to it. It would be better if we follow up with fever until the relief of the patient.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the fever of leprosy.
As for the lepers, they may benefit greatly from fever, especially the leprosy type which results from the discolouration of phlegm and black sputum.
If you want to examine for fever, if the leprosy is recent and it was treated according to what we mentioned earlier in this section without any decline or stagnation and you fear that corruption might invade all his humors, then administer five fevers on the head. The first one is in the usual place on the head, halfway between the eyebrows. The second is below it towards the forehead along the end of hair. Two are given at the temples and one behind on the occipital bone. Move your hand gently with fever until it affects the bone slightly.
And it peels off its scales to ease the inhalation of the thick vapors from it, and apply this fever on the liver as previously explained. If leprosy has continued for the patient and manifested clearly, then you should apply these fevers we mentioned on the head. A fever on the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the neck nodes, six on the back nodes. A large one on the spine above the buttocks and another above it at the same height, and two on each hip bone for each hip bone. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the ankles and two on the elbows, two on the nipples and pressing on each joint of his hands' and feet's joints as well as on each heel of his feet, tying his hands.
Watch out for the nerve at the heel to avoid burning them. It may press on the tibia bone, another one on the mouth of the stomach and yet another on the liver, and know that the more you press, the better and more effective it is.
Know that the untruthful finds pain from pressing as he does not feel numbness due to his body being numbed, and it should be noted that the pressure of large or small sizes should depend on the organs and joints according to the properties of the metals.
Then treat pressing with ground cardamom mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals if Allah willing.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In pressing for numbness, when a part of the body becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and bandages but does not heal, then remove the numbness from that part of the body by pressing according to what its bone deserves or its size. The pressure should be soft yet a little thick in the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. It may press for some numbness that is exposed to the hand and foot in the lumbar region of the back, where the nerve emerges that moves this part, thus eliminating the numbness.
Do not undertake this except for one who is knowledgeable about the dissection of organs and exits of body-moving nerves.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of smallpox.
If smallpox has run its course and no medical remedy works, let him rub it with oil that goes slightly deep into the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then, treat it with crushed lentil flour mixed with the ointment of rose leaves, the tongue of pregnancy blood or the blood of pigeons from each one a part, mix all and apply on a cloth until the healing occurs.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the case of cancer.
If the cancer is at its beginning stage and you wish to stop it, apply a heat source around it like how it moves. Some wise men have suggested applying intense heat in the center of the area; however, I do not believe this approach since I expect skin irritation which I've witnessed multiple times.
The correct method is to apply heat around it in a circular area as we have said, or with multiple small patches.
The one hundred and fifty-first chapter.
In the case of abscess.
If an abscess occurs in one of them and its maturation has been delayed either due to the cause that accelerates it or because the one who is too old with little blood, or due to time if you want to speed up the maturation of the abscess, apply small patches around it for a dot-by-dot treatment.
Then leave it as it will expedite maturation. If you want to boil it with heat, increase the intensity of the iron that has this shape.
Pour it in the middle of the pus sac until the skin is penetrated, and let it be below what lies at the bottom to facilitate the flow of the pus. Then treat it accordingly until it heals.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In the case of the eater.
The eater is merely decay that seeks within the organ, consuming it like fire devours dry wood. If I observe the eater in a location where it can be removed by heating, I would apply many small and large needles into the spot according to what suits the position of the eater there.
Then, secure it from every side until the decay is completely removed and nothing remains at all. Then leave it for three days. Apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the spots where the needles were placed so that the mucus will come out entirely along with all the decay.
Then, treat it with herbal ointments for wounds. If I see after three days that the flesh has grown healthily and there is no decay, otherwise reapply the treatment to what remains of the decayed areas. The eater can be treated with a strong medicine.
If it acts like fire, more quickly beneficial. I have mentioned its treatment with a strong medicine in the previous section; take from there whenever you need it.
The thirty-fifth and third chapter.
In the case of inverted needles and non-inverted needles.
This often happens in the soles of feet; it's a hard thing that wears out the foot, and the treatment for this is either by heating or by applying a strong water-based medicine.
If it is one made with fire, then take a quill similar to an eagle's feather that is made of iron around the length of the needle from every side and make its edge thin. Then place it as a guard on the needle, then move your hand around the needle with the tool until the tool reaches the depth of the needle.
And leave it for three days allowing pus to come out, then apply a poultice made of cooked grain and salted on the wound. Leave this poultice overnight; indeed it will detach from its roots, then treat the wound with the restorative ointment for wounds until it heals. If the needles were not bent,
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. It is recommended that you take a pipe made of copper or iron or eagle feather, insert it onto the needle or the hole, then pour a small amount of hot water into the pipe.
Hold your hand and move it slightly with a gentle rubbing as you turn it, so that the edge of the pipe affects the root of the needle. The hot water finds its way to the root of the needle, and the patient will endure for a moment on the smell of the hot water.
Then leave it, for the needle will come out with its roots. Do this one by one until you treat all that is in your body with it, then after they have come out, treat their sites using what grows from healing the flesh with ointments.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the use of cautery.
If there appears one of the protruding nodules in a cold lump on the nerve or a quarter fever, or any other, it is recommended to apply four or five cauteries on the spine between each vertebra, and one at his chest. On its method using the oil-based tannery process, for the fermentation takes place and accelerates the healing of the cold disease.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the case of acute urine retention in the body.
Certain fetid bladders may be expelled from the body. If these are formed by materials of cold, sticky and putrid substances, they should first appear at the tip of each well-tempered bladder where a reed has been lit or using a long tube or an optical glass lens that has been heated.
The granules stick to this form in their first expulsion, not increasing and dissipating its active effect; it is purified from them except when it becomes after the evacuation of the impurity by scratching.
The fifty-second chapter.
In the case of acute bleeding when an artery is cut.
Blood often leaks from an artery that has been cut during a wound exposed externally or at the incision of a tumor or organ, etc., making it difficult to cut.
If this happens to one, quickly place your hand on the mouth of the artery and put your second finger on it gently until you can feel the pulse under your finger preventing blood from flowing out. Then, heat several small and large oil-based tannery tools over fire until they become very hot.
Then, take one either small or large according to the wound and the place where the artery was cut. Put the tanning tool on the same vein after quickly pulling your finger off and hold the tool tightly until the blood stops.
If, during the lifting of the finger from the artery's mouth and extinguishing the lamp, you take another lamp by the wheel of a second lamp in the prepared furnace fire, continue doing that with one after another until the blood stops.
And take care not to burn a nerve if there is one, and speak another surgical rule about the amputee. Remember that if blood has flowed from the artery, it cannot be cut ever again, especially if the artery was large except by four means; either with forceps as we said, or by amputation if it had not been already amputated. If it is amputated, its ends contract and the blood stops. Either bind them with tight threads or apply medications that tend to stop blood flow and exert a firm compression through bandages.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a band or by pulling through piercing, or placing burned things and such, it will not cease in that manner except rarely. If exposed to one of these without having a doctor or medicine at hand, they should instruct someone to place the affected finger on the wound itself as we described.
He should be tightened to the extent that blood flow is completely stopped and flows out from above the wound, on the artery and finger. Water very cold, extremely cold, should not be used until the blood has frozen and hardened, and then it will stop. During this time, you need forceps or medicine as required.
The second door.
In the fracture, splintering, and cuts, as well as similar operations.
He said that after mentioning in the first chapter all illnesses for which forceps and burned medicines can be used, along with their reasons and causes, tools, and images of lamps, these were divided into chapters from the old times to the present.
And in this matter I follow this course of action specifically to facilitate what is required for the student.
And before I start this, my children, you should know that in this chapter there are more difficulties than in the first chapter.
And for that reason, the warning should be stronger here because working in this field often leads to the loss of blood which is essential for life when you are opening a wound or cutting into a tumor or an appendix or surgery or removing an arrow or cutting through a stone and so on. This all come with many dangers and fears, and death occurs in most of these cases.
And I advise you to avoid anything that could lead to doubts about you, for in this profession many people are found suffering from various illnesses; some have been weakened by their illness and suffered death.
Due to the severity of their suffering and the long duration of their illnesses, as well as the effects of their disease on determining death, some have spent all their wealth in hopes for their health but their illness was so deadly that they could not survive. Therefore, it is not advisable for you to assist those who exhibit this particular trait.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and concern, do not proceed with anything of this nature unless you have definite knowledge that this will lead to the desired outcome. Use all medical treatments for your illness with the progression of knowledge and warning about what leads to safety.
For in this, you will have a means to gain praise, glory, mention and gratitude. May Allah inspire you my children towards guidance, and may He not forbid you from the truth and success; for that is within His control, there is no god but Him.
And having organized this chapter into sections on what was presented in the previous chapter from the beginning to the end, it is hoped that you will be relieved of any need you may have if God willing.
The first chapter.
In the treatment of water that gathers at the head of boys.
This type of scab is often encountered in boys at birth if the midwife presses the head of the boy roughly, it may also happen for reasons that are hidden and unknown.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than boys, and everyone I saw among them died quickly for that reason. Therefore, I left working on it. And I have seen a boy whose head was full of water, and the head grows larger every day. Until he could no longer bear to sit on himself due to the size of his head and the moisture increased until it killed him.
This moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone or under the bone on the scalp. The work in this should be that if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the tumor is small, it would be necessary to cut a single groove across the head until the moisture flows. This is an example of the scalpel's use.
If the moisture is more abundant and the tumor is larger, make two intersecting cuts like this:.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you can see open lines on all sides of the head, and the water decreases when you press it with your hand inside. It should not be hidden from you; therefore, three cuts should be made in the center of the head like this:.
After the incision, all moisture is discharged then the incisions are strengthened with lacerations and ligatures. Then it is rinsed from above with water and oil until the fifth day. After that, the suture is removed and the wound is treated with poultices and ointments without leaving an excessive head compression and feeding the sick on all kinds of dry food with low moisture content.
Until the member strengthens and recovers, another method for the cut involves observing where the bone of the tumor appears and the location where water is gathered since it may be at the back of the head or its front part or on the right side or in the north.
You are referring to the incision where the tumor appears and where water is gathered, so you make an incision as much as you can and be careful not to cut a vessel causing bleeding, which will lead the sick person to die from that blood loss along with expelling moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Cutting the two veins behind the ears, known as the haiysins.
When someone experienced severe attacks affecting both eyes or the chest, and conventional medical treatments failed to provide relief in this situation, it is advised to resort to cutting these two veins.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the sick person's head with a scythe. Then, mark the location with a rough incision until the vein becomes visible. Next, tighten the neck of the sick person with a belt or rope. Finally, locate where the pulse beats and their positions behind the ears. The veins are usually not hidden except in some people.
Then, practice on them with a needle. Cut both of them using the lancing instrument to the bone, and this will be done across the head; if you wish, you can insert the lancet from under the vein and cut upwards until above, making the length of each cut about two inches long.
If the sweat duct is interrupted, blood flows out in a pulsating stream that rushes forward with successive layers. If there is no arterial flow perceived by touch, it would seem that you should estimate three fingers from the ear and then proceed to use a tool for incision until reaching the bone, and what seems necessary thereafter.
The blood sends six streams for conveyance, and it may send more or less than this according to the strength of the patient's condition and how full their arteries are. Afterwards, observe the wound; if there is still a piece of bone remaining from the suture line, cut it off.
To prevent a hot tumor from appearing, then suture the wound with a thread of a needle and apply ointments to it until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Suturing the two veins in the armpit.
If a person experiences chronic fatigue or severe, frequent hot baths and heat in the armpit muscles or persistent severe headache and so on, treated with various medical treatments without any effect. We have tried suturing the veins or ligating them (tying off) in these diseases as we described.
The aim of ligation is to shave the hair on the axilla, focusing particularly on the visible vein in the pit. It becomes apparent from its pulsation; little is hidden except for individuals among people.
Or when the cold is severe, if it's hidden from you, let the sick person tighten their neck with a collar of their garment. Then you cut the spot or heat up the area with hot water until the vein becomes visibly and clearly present. Then take the clamp which is shown here. Then, using it gently, slit the skin until you reach the artery. Then place a clamp on it and pull it upwards so that it comes out of the skin. Remove any pus underneath from all sides. If the artery is thin, roll it with the tip of the clamp. Then cut from it a part which allows both ends to spread, and tighten it without causing bleeding. If it does not abscess or rupture, blood has not flowed at all. Then drain the blood through six holes to three.
If the artery is large, it may be necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread. The thread should either be made of catgut or from the strings of a violin so that bacteria do not have time to spread before the wound heals and causes bleeding.
Then, cut a part between the ligatures. You do this either at that moment or after some time. Alternatively, you may seal it with hot iron until its tips bleed. This operation is replaced by the same procedure or an improved one as we have said.
Except if the patient has a fever or mood swings, as heating seals moisture out and becomes more beneficial. After bleeding both arteries, stuff the area with old cotton and place tight dressings on it. Then treat with the medicines that promote tissue growth and fomentations until God wills it.
If bleeding occurs during your operation, act immediately to cut it with a knife or fill the area with wax and tighten your hand until the blood stops. If nothing prevents this, place your finger until the blood clots.
And continue the site with extreme cold water until the pain subsides and you adhere to what should, and from that which is lighter and easier than bleeding through the artery, that the sweat be absorbed by this bandage of two knives after learning the positions with a stylus.
And she lowers it very deeply until it reaches the bone, causing sweat in two places to spread between its ends so that they don't stick together, this is how the bandage looks.
The tips of the two knives are like the small tines, but they are much less sharp than a knife because if both were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them more quickly and the flesh wouldn't cut off fast. If there is some hardness in them, it holds on to their fire's heat.
The flesh is cut quickly, this action is better than all actions and is lighter and easier. Let there be a thickness equal to that of the finger between the knives.
Chapter Four.
In treating the constant hot overflow of tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their overflow is from the sweat glands on the forehead from outside, and there was no benefit in treating the doctor's medicine therapy, I saw the face of the needy had become red. He feels a stinging in his forehead like that of an ant's bite and his eyes are drooping, wetted with their tears which have congealed on them and their eyelids were shaken from the sharpness of the tears. They were forced to resort to this treatment initially for her, they call it the sword therapy, which is commanding the needy person to shave the hair in his forehead.
Then three incisions are made on the forehead, parallel to the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two finger widths. The first one runs parallel to the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one is slightly away from the movement muscle behind the lip, and the third one runs on the other side.
And be cautious about cutting the two veins on each side; keep your hand beyond the connection of the jaws. Leave a space after each incision equal to three fingers and have ready with you a spongy or absorbent gauze so that it can soak up the blood.
Then, the sharp ends of the forceps, which is what this image depicts, is inserted. From the incision near the mouth to the middle incision, all the skin between the two incisions is removed along with the dermis on the bone. Then, this procedure is also done from the middle incision to the third incision, and then this forceps is withdrawn. Also enters the first incision another instrument called a sharp scalpel from one side and smooth non-sharp from the other, this is what it looks like:.
And make its sharp side towards the attached flesh and its smooth side towards the bone, push it until it reaches the middle incision and cut with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other, after bleeding moderately from the blood, squeeze the places of the clotted blood. Then put cotton threads in each incision and apply a compress soaked with water and oil or honey and oil on them.
To prevent a hot tumor, by the third day, the bandage is removed and the wound is treated with many applications of lukewarm water. Then it's treated with balsamic ointment and rose oil, as well as all other treatments for wounds until it heals, if Allah wills.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
One experienced a frequent, intense and persistent deluge where the eyes were seen to be tiny and sagging, with their vision weakened. The eyelids are swollen and hair was falling out from them. Pain is felt deeply in the head, accompanied by severe and painful headaches along with a continuous cough. Recognize these symptoms as indications that such substances and discharges are coming from many deep-seated veins. The best treatment for this condition involves shaving the forehead of the patient first, followed by making a single cut down the center of the forehead.
Pain is felt deeply in the head, accompanied by severe and painful headaches along with a continuous cough. Recognize these symptoms as indications that such substances and discharges are coming from many deep-seated veins. The best treatment for this condition involves shaving the forehead of the patient first, followed by making a single cut down the center of the forehead. Or lift the wound slightly to the side and begin cutting from the left corner of the mouth to the right. The cut should go towards the bone, and keep your hand away from the moving muscles of the cheeks until you can see through the bone, then sponge out all blood with a spongy tool.
Divide the lips of the incision with an old cotton or a thread from the cotton, then pull upwards with suture threads and soak the sutures in water and oil to prevent a hot tumor formation. When you have removed it, if you see that the hot tumor has penetrated through, you should scrape the bone for new flesh growth to occur.
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, for instance by taking two parts of sesame flour and four parts of hyssop, preparing a paste from them, and using it to promote flesh growth in surgeries like these.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four types: either a metal or stone-like object such as iron and glass, or a plant seed like fava beans and seeds alike, or something liquid like water and vinegar among others.
Either an animal, if it falls in the ear a stone or a kind of stone that does not exceed in the ear, receive by the ear towards the sun. If you see the stone blacken something from fat of snail or scalpel then try to remove it with the movement of the head or vibrating with the forceps. 塞住打喷嚏者，在咳嗽出现后，如果在耳朵周围系上一个破布环或丝绸带，将耳朵举到上方。通常情况下，这种方式就能清除异物。若未能清除，或者即使有所改善，尝试使用温柔的火钳，如图所示进行清除。
If the extraction with the forceps fails, try removing it using a thin, slightly curved blind iron. If this also does not work, make a brass tube and insert one end of the tube gently into the ear hole.
Plug the tube around with a wick dipped in oil so that there is no path for the wind other than the tube. Then pull it strongly and often with your breath, it usually comes out this way. If it does not come out as described and instead, take a small piece of bird bait or well-prepared bird food and place it at the tip of the syringe.
After tightly wrapping it with a snug cotton, gently insert it into the ear canal after drying out the moisture in the ear. If it doesn't come out as described, proceed to the incision before it develops the hot tumor or twitching.
The method for the incision is to separate the ear from the skull first and remove some blood according to its strength, then hold the ear in your hands and turn it upwards. Make a small cut at the base of the ear when it's fatty at the lower part of its location.
The cut should be in a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever tools you can manage, afterwards stitch up the cut as quickly as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the falling thing in the ear is one of the grains that grow and puff up, try to remove it with what we mentioned. If this does not push it out, take a soft, fine tweezers according to this image.
And try to cut off that type of grain that falls in the ear. However, you do this only if you are sure that that grain has become small pieces due to the steam of the ear, then extract it by using a blind sump or a soft spatula or by suction.
As we mentioned, it facilitates its removal, and as for the water entering the ear, it should be expected to use expectoration with a spout first. He fills his ear with some used cotton, which is lying on that wet ear in which there is water. If he removes it in this way.
And if not, take many small pebbles along the fingers and heat them slightly with fire. The sputum from one of these enters his ear hole and is blown on each foot in that direction and hit by another stone on the stone in the ear.
He continues to do this with a grain after another until all the water is removed. Water may be extracted by taking one of the goose down or feather and inserting its end into the ear, then heating the other end so that it burns most of it before repeating the process with another feather.
Do this several times until all the water is removed or suck it out using the tube as explained with the grain. As for removing the animal that has entered it, look if its body size is small like a pin and alike then treat it with what was mentioned in the section.
If it is large and its presence can be felt by touch, try to remove it using forceps and ear pipers. This makes the removal easier than all other operations performed on the ear. And as for removing the wax that has grown in the ear, if you treated it with what we mentioned in the section about purging the body, and if your treatment was not successful.
You should look into the ear in the sunlight. If you see something of wax, try to remove it with forceps or soft pipers. But if there's nothing visible from them, take this tube and capture its picture.
The tube is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the delicate tip of it into the ear as far as what can be tolerated by the patient, then apply strong suction on that spot. Repeat this process until all wax has been removed. If it fails to remove the wax, seal around the tube with beeswax, as we instructed you for the stone case.
If what we've mentioned doesn't work, use the catheters that I have mentioned. They were tried first in killing wax and you will find them explained in the article about the catheters. Your dregs or medicines should be dropped into the ear using this device, as shown here:
Just as you see, it is made from silver or brass. It's narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. You can choose to have a metal piston inside the tube for tighter control, or you could make it softer by wrapping cotton tightly on its tip.
Then, pour the oil or juice or any other medicine you wish into the tube. Place it in the ear. Then, insert the cotton wick from above and gently squeeze your hand to release a moderate pressure. The medicine will then flow into the auditory canal and be felt.
Insert internally in the patient, and let whatever goes into the ear be heated slightly in fire. Be cautious that which moves inside it isn't too cold or too hot; for the ear can't bear this.
The Seventh Chapter.
In the treatment of ear obstruction.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs and ears without being attached [or pierced].
It may also expose some people to obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or newly attached flesh there. This blockage can be deep within an earring hole that is not visible.
It may extend slightly outside the hole and be visible. The one who is deep in the ear, not visible, will usually be difficult to see. The one that can be seen should have the ear of Albucasis placed in the sun. And you should look into it, if I see the obstruction visible, then open it with a gentle pair of forceps; its appearance will be like this:.
One of its ends has a slight projection that is limited by some of the other forceps and both sides are smooth to avoid injuring the ear. If the obstruction consists of flesh that has grown in the ear canal, hold it with a gentle tweezer and cut it off very gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a smooth gentle tool and heat it slightly in fire then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction along with the heaviness of hearing that the deaf person experiences, use a soft force to remove it gently.
And beware not to injure the ear's nerve, then insert a wick into the ear equal in size to the depth of the hole that has been oiled with Egyptian ear wax. Do this for days until you are safe from the wound joining together or else dip a wick into water and rub it with powdered zinc.
If you see the ear has swollen, apply it to it if a hot ember comes out, it should induce pus and then replace it with another wick that was soaked in rose oil until it calms down the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is a bleeding, immerse a sponge or a wick in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all other treatment that stops the mentioned bleeding as described in the article of tanning substances.
The eighth chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses that occur in the cheeks.
These abscesses that appear in the eyelids can be wet or dry. It should be grasped with a scissor or pincers and cut from its root using forceps. Then apply it to the place in powder form.
If it bleeds, squeeze it with a soft spectacles forceps and tie the wound better after cutting; often if there is something left from its root even after cutting, it may recur. If you burn it with fire, those roots will be burned and it will not recur.
The ninth chapter.
In the treatment of cold occurring in the cheeks of the eye.
Very often something similar to cold appears in the cheeks with its intensity and hardness.
And that's why it is called cold, which is the assembly of dense moisture in the upper and lower eyelid. The treatment involves looking to see if the cold lump protrudes from the surface of the eyelid; move it in every direction; this requires little effort. So cut its depth across.
Then, gently slit it from every side until it drains. Hang it with a pincers and cut it. If you can't cut it immediately after the incision penetrates the eyelid, that won't harm the operation. If the incision is large, stitch it together and treat it until it heals.
If it's small, there is no harm in cutting it off. The ointment will force him and stick him together. If the redness leans towards the inside of the eyelid towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid over and hang the redness with a hook without having to make a cut and penetrate her from each side.
If the eyelid is cut off, it will not harm anything. Then, wash the eye with salty water after cutting off the redness and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the pus disappears.
Chapter Ten.
In treating the squint that is exposed in the eyelid.
The squint is a growth that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid. This condition is more common among boys and it makes their eyes heavy, making them prone to night blindness. They are also unable to look directly at the sun's light. In order that their tears hasten to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces always and sleep there. Their foreheads become wet due to tears that are constantly coming out as a result of the inflated and swollen squint which is visible to everyone. When you touch the area with your fingers, you can feel the squint between them. The aim is for the pus (الويليل) to lay its head on your stone (الحجر), meaning it will be squeezed out by pressing against the hard surface.
Then, take a piece of cotton and prepare from it a thread. Make a circle out of that thread as big as possible around the squint from all sides. Then put it on top and squeeze it from every side with your fingers to collect the pus in the middle of the circle.
Then, make a cut in the center of this wetness with a sharp tool diagonally across, and let the length of the cut not be bigger than the one found on the eyelid. As for depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the pus (الويليل).
In most cases, the cataract bulges out of the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. You draw it with a tool that you have wrapped between your fingers from inside to outside as you move your hand left and right until it is freed. Be cautious not to over-stretch the incision, lest the forceps damage the eye.
If the cataract does not appear in the first incision, you should slightly extend the cut gently until the cataract emerges. Then draw it as we said before. Then immerse a tool with vinegar and water and place it on the site and tighten it softly, some people use salt to press it.
Then place it in the cavity of the incision so that it dissolves what remains of this moisture. Then treat it until it clears. If there was a hot spot and an inflammation occurred, cool it down with soothing dressings until it clears.
The eleventh chapter.
In types of eye inflammation.
If a growth appears on the eyelid, an excess above the natural course beneath the normal lashes, and I bind it, this harms the eye and causes various diseases such as constant watering, drooping of the eyelids, whitening and puffiness. To such an extent that this becomes a reason for the failure or destruction of the eye.
Eye inflammation can occur in four ways: either by burning with fire as described under the section of burning, or through using a strong medicine as previously mentioned. Alternatively, it may be caused by cutting and sewing, or by pressing, as I have noted.
You should place the eyelid at your ear, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns over successfully otherwise insert an awl into it from under the lower lid and thrust the awl through the thread from above. This makes contact with the hair root itself. Then pull the thread upwards by the eyelid.
It is then manipulated with the forceps, after that it is cut in the eyelid tissue, not through excess hair. The operation starts from the larger canal to the smaller one using the nicking instrument, then pulls the thread. Then she places a small cotton or pin pad under the eyelid. Finally, it is closed on the eyelid with needle sutures.
Like a sheet of an Ace card, but one must have its shape according to the extent you wish for lifting the eyelid as it may differ between people; some need that you cut from the eyelid a suitable amount according to the extent their eye-lids relax.
And there are those who need to cut less of all that according to the relaxation of the eyelid, then open with the forceps along the two lines you taught and start from the larger canal to the smaller one. The incision is made close to natural hair line as tight as a forcep's grasp.
Then the scissor enters one of the skin corners, then removes it all. The lips are then stitched together with a needle and fine thread, then wipe away any remaining blood. Afterward, anything that was left from the threads can be affixed to the eyebrows using additional items if needed.
You may choose to do it this way, or if you prefer not to, that's fine too. The stitches and threads remain for about three days or four, then treat the wound. If you choose to leave the cut open without stitches, apply treatments that dry and tighten; when the wound heals and closes, the eyelid will lift. Stitches are better.
This is the face of a surgeon, I mentioned it earlier except that there's an inconvenience with it; however, it works well and there's no danger involved. Another aspect in surgery is to make incisions on the eyelid in a shape similar to an Ace card, as described. Then the eyelid is lifted with three needles that are either separated or grouped as shown in this illustration.
Then the preferred part of the eyelid is cut with small scissors as shown in this picture, the cuts are made with moderation:.
If you cannot hold the needles, take a needle with a thread and put it in the middle of the figure as shown, then bring another thread close to the larger opening and a third thread close to the smaller opening. Gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then lift your hand slightly but firmly.
Then lift the taught skin as described, stitch both lips of the wound together and treat it until it heals. If a swollen lump appears when you cut or incise something, apply a salve like carbolic acid or other soothing ointments to that lump.
And the lower eyelid may also have its lashes reversed; it should be treated using cutting, sewing and applying salves as described. Use fire or strong medicine for application on fire or strong medicine which is more effective but less harsh than cutting and sewing, especially in cases of both methods.
The treatment with the cane is performed as follows: you should flip the eyelid, incise from inside on what was described, then create two or three sticks that are thin and long all along the eyelid but narrower than the opening.
And I applied at the tips of both sides from both ends where the threads stick, then gently gather them on the preferred part of the eyelid and pull the sticks on both sides tightly. Leave it for a few days; the tightened skin dies, darkens and rots.
Even if it causes harm, loan her the interest and then treat her until she is healed. If her fever subsides and her eyelids rise without her eyelashes turning white, this is a sign of her good health. The two henna marks are created on her body in such shape and size uniformly both longitudinally and laterally:.
The Second Chapter.
In lifting the dead hair from the eye by using needles.
If it is a hair or two strands working for this task, you should take a fine needle and insert therein a thread of very fine silk that has been smoothly polished. Then gather its ends and tie them in a very delicate knot, with the length of the thread being about a handspan.
Then, in the hollows of your fingers, place another thread that is finer than the first one, shorter and you can tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient lie down on a stone near the sun so it can observe this work closely since it's meticulous detail. Next, insert the needle into the root of the excess hair through the hollows in your fingers.
And perform this procedure on the eyelid with a wheel so that it comes out above the natural hair, then pull the thread up to the hollows and introduce the hair strand back into these hollows if it is one or two or three strands at most.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out along with the hollows in the eyelid, together with the natural hair. If you pulled the hollows but didn't extract the hair with them, the hollows got pulled down by the thread that was inserted into them till they came out from the upper hole.
Then place the hair back in its hollows and pull them. Do this until you see it rise up to the upper hole, making it visible for the eye. Then remove the hollows and thread, extract them, and tighten the eye. Leave it tightened for two or three days so that the hair is held in place, and flesh will grow over it.
If the stitch is short, either you add a long hair from your natural hair which will rise with it, or you leave it until it grows longer, then when that happens you remove it.
The thirteenth chapter.
In treating the stitches that occur in the upper eyelid.
These stitches, which occur in this condition, are called strabismus. The stitches can either be natural or incidental. An incidental stitch arises from a wound, incision, or tear and so on.
The purpose of the treatment is to open up this scar, to separate its edges and create a thread-like opening between them. You then tie it until it heals. It is not advisable to use things that dry out or constrict in her treatment.
If you do this, the strabismus will return more severely than before. Instead, use things that relax like the ring and the tongue with water where I have used a chalk stick, cotton ball extract and perfume that has dissolved with something of fat and you smear it on. Then treat her with it.
And the solution to treating it is to try with every trick that she does not heal in the same form as before. This action we mentioned is a kind of correction for strabismus, not to restore the original location's shape according to what was originally supposed to be.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In treating the strabismus that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This strabismus that occurs at the bottom is what we call a true strabismus, which can be either natural or incidental. The incidental one arises from a wound, incision, tear, and so on.
The method of working in it is to take a needle with two threads within and pierce the flesh, then pass it from the left incision to the right until the thread becomes inside both parts of the meat. Then lift the flesh upwards by the needle and cut it with a wide surgical scissor.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is supposed to be and otherwise you take a thread, place it on the spot of the cut, turn the eyelid with it, make two cuts inside the eyelid, making its ends from the corners of the cut area until they meet, forming an angle. Until if they meet, it becomes similar to this shape:.
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what follows the eyelid. Then gather the separated parts with two threads and sew it with wool thread. Then treat it with the remedies we mentioned for relaxing and healing until it heals.
And if the ulceration was exposed from a cut or stitch, or in accordance with what should be, then make a simple incision without hair removal too as previously mentioned. Then separate between the lips by flossing as we have stated.
And when talking about treating a sore throat, whether it is above or below, the procedure should be according to how the sore throat presents itself. There can be a great variety in appearance, and the surgeon devises his strategy in whatever way he can manage.
Until it returns to or closely resembles its natural shape, and the same disease guides you on what is suitable for him from work and tools in most cases.
The fifteenth chapter.
In suturing the eyelid to the lid stump or to the cornea.
This suturing may show many individuals that the upper lid gets sutured to the white part of the eye, which hinders its ease of movement and interferes with its natural actions. It should be that a thread loop enters under the eyelid.
And lift it up or extend it with a strap, then cut the attachment with a gentle clipper that is not sharp like the clipping tool but rather slightly so to prevent any distress for the patient when working. The clipper should pass through and cut gently as if you are removing that attachment.
And expect until the eyelid returns to its natural state and when all the attachment is healed, you then pour in the eye salty water to wash it or sprinkle it with saline solution from a camel's nostril pipe. Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with cotton thread.
And place on the eye a swab dipped in egg white, and use the removed camel's nostril pipe until it heals after the third day.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and suturing the ulcers.
The nail can be in two forms, either it is nervous and resembles a hard, delicate scab, or it is not nervous and resembles a hardened white moisture if it has been touched by iron or broken off with a strap tool where it would have broken.
If the strap tool did not stick in her, and both types start from the larger horn until it thins gradually to cover the eye and prevent light and eye movement. The work involves having the patient lie down on your rock.
Then he opens his eyes and lifts the lid with your hand, then catches the nail with a small bent instrument and raises it up. Then he takes a needle and inserts a hair from horse or cow's fur or a strong thread, bends the end of the needle slightly and pierces it in the middle of the nail.
And it is done with the needle, binding the nail with thread and raising it up. Then you cut off beside the nail next to the eyelid as if you are spreading it out with the hair until you reach its end, then you cut off the rest at the base of the nail with a gentle pair of scissors or small scissors, leaving the natural nail behind.
So as not to cause a constant flow of tears from cutting, the nail is stretched by the instrument alone or with thread as we said, then it is cut with a smooth pair of scissors whose tip looks like this:.
And she/he must guard against the scissors touching the corneal epithelium, causing a tear and resulting in an infection of the eye. After cutting, insert something into the eye from powdered salt or from fly dust and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and cannot be penetrated by a needle or cannot hold an instrument, it often treats this type of nail with medications which heals as described in the section. If you wish to cut it, open the eye.
Take a smooth pair of scissors with a weak edge, as in this image:. Gently remove the nail above it without scraping. If you notice that it is softening and breaking off, then scrape only with the edge of your finger on the red or blue fly dust in the eye, or powdered salt, and hold back the eyelid for another day.
Then, continue the operation until all is gone except if a hot lump interferes in the eye. In that case, leave it and treat the hot lump until it heals, then resume the operation on her with the balance (of healing time), until she fully recovers, and as for the patient's wound.
If it happens that the patient hurts his/her eye, which is a terrible pain, suspend this part of the patient on a nail and cut off some of it, but do not insist on cutting for fear of causing tears to flow. Then, soak in deep wells with red water or camel urine until he/she heals.
The seventeenth chapter.
In cutting the wounding and what grows from excess flesh in the eye.
It may grow in some people red flesh stacked together, covering the eye or approaching it, perhaps overflowing onto the cheeks and causing the cheeks to turn outwards, resembling an inflamed eyelid.
The procedure involves having the patient place his head in a depression, then opening his eyes and collecting all of that red flesh with forceps that match the size.
Or you may hold it with a spatula or forceps. Then, cut the red flesh one by one until all is cut and removed from the eye to avoid harming it during operation. Your cut should either be made using the file we described in cutting the rib bone, or with a small scalpel. Like those that are used by surgeons as depicted in this following image of the door.
Once your cut is done and all the wounding has been removed, fill the eye with saltwater or soak it with red and similar strong medications. Then place a piece of cotton that's the color of egg white over the eye from the outside to cool down the hot lump.
If there remains of the inflammation, your patient's blood is plentiful and I fear the hot tumor, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the tumor. Then proceed with the operation as required until full recovery occurs. Similarly, deal with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, it is incumbent upon you to avoid treating any weak eye through ligation or by surgery with iron. Do not resort to such practices until you are convinced that this organ can withstand such actions.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the division of the canal of the eye.
The vessels are red threads that interweave on the eye, preventing vision and weakening it with the passage of days. Firstly, you should observe: if the eye containing these vessels is strong and there is no other disease besides the vessels, then proceed.
When this is the case, perform the ligation: instruct the patient to place his head on your knee. Then suspend those vessels with a single thread or two according to your judgment, and ensure that the threads bend gently in this manner:.
or have them form twin double threads inside one body like this:
Then, using a gentle pair of scissors, gently grasp those vessels and wipe away the blood little by little. When you see that the eye is clear of these vessels and that the blood has dissipated, be careful not to injure the eye with the edges of the scissors, let your work take up half of the day when facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work to ensure that you do not cut anything other than those vessels. When finished, pinch the green or red scar in the eye so that it can consume what is left of the canal aggressively. If you cannot ligate all of it at that time, cover the eye with something that relieves the pain of the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and settles, then assure that the hot lump has stabilized. Then, resume working on this method with her using the same item to heal her from this picture of suffering and pain.
Leave it [so that the head of the pupil is in a stone for students, and at the end, one weeps tears and achieves moisture throughout the front part of the eye and its posterior]. The fundamental aspect of the operation is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openings held by the student.
Fixed, so that the head of the patient is in a stone for students and at the end one weeps tears achieving moisture throughout the front part of the eye and its posterior. The fundamental choice is to begin with pinching from above or below the eye; first, pinch two in the highest pouch, one near the back of the cornea and the other near the beginning of it.
Hold it between the median and the saphenous vein, then connect two tubes from under them. Then hold it between the inguinal ligament and the pubic symphysis and lift your hand slightly to see all the veins raised up; if you use a scalpel, cut from the small west side, and if you use a gentle forceps.
Enter the needle into the threads and make sure all veins have risen onto the surface, then do not cut the wetness because tears and blood may smear you.
Then cut with the scalpel from above and below what exceeds the cornea to prevent a stubble remaining in the cornea. If possible, you can lift it off the cornea using the needle; this is better and may be preferred by some people.
And after cutting it, it would cause his beard to hurt for days until the pain subsides and settles in the hot lump. Then resume working on him.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the direction of returning the hair to the nose.
Doctors who treat the hair, referred to as Nasu' or Nasour, use heat or cauterizing medicine applied according to what was previously described. If it doesn't cure, the only solution is to cut into the tumor when it matures, and remove all moisture inside or pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see decay or blackness in it, strip it with this machine as depicted:.
The tool called the "awl" is made of Indian iron, and its tip is cylindrical like a drill with a thin engraving that resembles the cooling or burshing tool. You place it on the decayed area in the bone then you rotate it between your fingers while slightly moving your hand to understand that this decay has been removed.
You perform this process multiple times, then you apply the dried and squeezed medicines to that area. If the place closes up and new flesh grows there, and if the medicine's effect ends after a period of forty days without any relapse or complications occurring.
Know that if it has healed, otherwise the only solution is to return Nasu' (the hair) into the nasal cavity in this manner; this involves exposing the bone again with iron or cauterizing medicine. If the bone is exposed, take out a hair on this image:.
The tip of the tool would be triangular with its shaft conical and tapering towards the tip, as you can see. Then place it on the bone itself. It should be close to your nose and a little further than your eye when using this method. Then move your hand with the tool until the bone is broken and feels by the patient.
That when he holds his hand over his nose, the wind finds its way out from him. At that point, force the place with the pressed dried drugs as you have been taught. When the flesh grows and hardens in that spot, the substance which used to flow outward returns to the nose. This will be less burdensome on the patient if God willing.
The twentieth chapter.
If the eye ball retracts.
If the eye falls out completely without causing any harm or loss in sight, it should be made easier for the patient. Then you should spread it on the eyelid. After that, place a pessary in the socket and remove it gently with great care.
Then, place a poultice made from date pits, flour, milk, and butter on the eye. After that, lift the eyelid with many bandages above it. The description for the bandage is to take a lot of soft incisions which are folded four times each to make many layers.
Then, place one on top of another according to what your eye needs, and tighten it with a hard incision strongly. Then repeat the pessary removal without any issues. After that, remove the pessary and leave the eye tightened for a day and night.
If the ligament relaxes during this period, it should be tightened again gently. Remove the bandage after a day and night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the dressing, bandages, tightening, and pessary application until it does return.
The twenty-first chapter.
In cutting the ankylosis.
If a fistula occurs in the albuwaydiyah layer, then it emerges outside the eyes as if it were a bunch of grapes and spoils the appearance of humans. If you want to remove it, do so according to what I describe.
And that is, to insert a needle from the bottom to the top in the bunch of grapes, then insert another needle with two threads from the inner corner and pass it through. Keep the first needle as it is.
Then cut at the bend of the doubled thread, tie some bunch of grapes around the needle with it and pull tightly. Then remove the needle. Place a piece of wool soaked in egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads along with the grapes drop off. Then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals. The grapes are tightened from every side in a circle made of thread, so that the eye becomes rounder. Then she uses a thin file until it reaches the corner of the eye to drain the egg white fluid and help the eye to reduce its size and settle down again. She tightens it until healing occurs.
The twenty-second chapter.
In treating conjunctivitis.
This condition, which is called conjunctivitis, consists of a collection in the eye that resembles water but without any substance. The treatment involves placing the patient upright on a chair and then holding their head by your hands from both sides.
Move their head until the collection moves to your eye level and remains there, allowing light to pass through as if it was being seen before. If it doesn't move down below, we conclude that it is water. If the condition isn't as described, then it's not a case of conjunctivitis according to what we've mentioned.
Unless, then place the patient before you, take a fine scalpel, and cut slightly above the corneal epithelium membrane in the ciliary region down to the cornea's tissue until the material is removed.
If only a hot water, mixed with milk or boiled in which a sheep's milk has been cooked, comes out of the eye, treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
We have mentioned the types of water in a previous section and which type is suitable for dripping according to explained and clarified instructions. Take it from there considering its suitability, then you should place your patient sitting upright facing the light close to the sun.
And fix the healthy eye firmly, then lift its lid with your left hand if it's the left eye having the water, or with your right hand if it's the right eye.
And place the tip of the syringe near the ciliary body, in the whiteness of the eye from the smaller side. Then push the syringe with strength while you're guiding it with your hand until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye and you feel that the syringe has reached something empty.
It should be that the distance the syringe goes into depth is equal to the length from the child to the end of the blackness, which is the ciliary body. You will see the copper in the same vision as if you were seeing the eye for clarity of the corneal membrane, then guide the syringe upwards until it reaches the position where the water is.
Then press it down again and again, if the water flows out of his bladder, then he will see what was opened in his bladder with his eyes and there is a needle in his eye. Then he stays for a little while, if the water ascends, then he lowers him again without taking the needle out.
And when it stabilizes and does not ascend, remove the needle gently while moving your hand with it a little bit at a time. Then dissolve some fine salt from under myriads of grains in water and use this to wash the inside of the eye. Afterwards, place all of the eyelid or cotton that is saturated inside the eye from the outside.
Apply a paste made of radish and egg white, and tie it to the healthy eye. As for us and those from our time, we place powdered cloves with egg white on top. If the needle does not fit into the eye because of its hardness, some people have eyes that are extremely hard. You should take the pliers which is called 'braid', it looks like this:.
Pierce it only with the tool, do not concentrate on making a hole. Rather, you should gently tap where the needle will be placed and then insert the needle as we have mentioned. After completing your task, prepare for the patient to lie down firmly in a dark room on their back, sleeping comfortably.
Avoid all movements and coughing. Provide him with food that soothes his nature, do not let him move his head right or left in any way. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then he can be released into the dark room and tested for vision.
Show him objects, then tighten the bandage until the seventh day. It is not advisable to do this during treatment or immediately after urination from your bladder. Rather, you should avoid it before water starts rising quickly with intense gaze.
If a tumor appears hot, it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day and this treatment settles the tumor until it has settled. Then one should open his eyes and place on his forehead a veil under which he practices his sight for days while he is in that dark room.
He gradually leaves the house and adapts to its surroundings, know that the learner cannot do without observation in some instances; then proceeds with work. I have heard from some Iraqis that he mentioned making a drinking horn in Iraq which absorbs water.
No one has done this in our country or I have not read about it in any of the first books. Perhaps it might be new, and here is a picture of different types of drinking horns to stand on due to their ignorance:
It is made specifically from copper, and its tip has this particular smoothness with a triangular end that is sharp.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In treating the flowing flesh in the nose.
Certainly, it may grow in the nose different types of flesh that are somewhat similar to two insects with many legs. There is also cancerous tissue, which is stuck like mucus, and there's also soft flesh that doesn't resemble mucus.
If this kind of flesh is soft, not poisonous or cancerous, then it would be advisable for you to place the patient facing the sun with their open mouth and have them blow air into these tissues. Then draw it out after that. Cut what has been recognized from it using a sharp curved blade on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, and if there remains something that you cannot cut, scrape it off with one of the smooth machines gently until nothing is left. If blood overcomes you or an inflamed lump appears.
Against this, if it is necessary or among the malignant tumors, cut it open until the blood stops and all tissues go away. Then after cutting, put in the nostril some fat and water or a drink. If the nose opens up and its moisture passes to the throat.
Know that he is healed, if the moisture does not reach as it should. Know that there is living flesh inside under the soft bones which have decayed and were not reached by the operation; henceforth you are required to take a thread of cotton that has some stiffness in it.
And she makes many knots and places between each knot as much as an inch or less. The wet thread is inserted in his nose with a pinch or whatever can be done after making it like a needle, and he pulls the wind until it reaches the nasal meatus.
And it comes out on his neck, and often the boys who write do this action as well, which is easier for whoever desires it, then gather together each end of the single thread that came out at the mouth and the other one that remained in the nose.
Then she uses the spread of the flesh with the knots in the thread. She does this until she understands that the flesh has been cut by the thread's knots. Then she removes the thread and enters in the nose after wiping off a bit of blood which the Egyptian ointment has sucked. She performs this action for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that is left of the flesh. Then, the last thing in the nose is a lead tube for some days until he is healed. If it required treatment to dry it out, she used this method.
This is an image of the syringe with which the liquids and medications drip in the nose:.
It places a semi-candelabra made of tin or copper open at the top and with its channel similarly treated.
And if you wish, I can make the tube closed like a stalk and smooth out the surface of the spoon that is used for scraping.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, by which one holds it when you heat the fat or anything else you wish from the juices or liquid things.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the thylacine, it is located at the end of the nose.
It often grows in a bony protrusion at the end of the nose which increases and grows over time until it spoils its appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut him at the first appearance and remove all of it. Then, apply either wax or the burned medicine that takes the place of wax. If you miss cutting it until it grows larger, look then if it has hardened and become solid like a shade with little sensitivity.
Do not expose him to iron, for he is a cancerous tumor, and I have seen many cases of cutting this tumor which led to great pain in the owner. If the tumor is soft and does not resemble a shade with little sensitivity, then it is possible to cut it completely. So, drain the pus and cut it without fear or hesitation, then treat the site with what dries and tightens until it heals.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In nose, lips, and ear缝ing. If there is a separation of its connection from the wound or something similar, know that if a connection separation occurs in one of these organs, only some people's work will affect it unless it involves a small area.
When presenting something of this to one, observe if the wound is soft with its blood; then stitch together the edges of the cut and treat it until it heals. If the connection has separated, causing each cut to be sound, it would be necessary to incise each separate wound through the visible skin until it heals.
Then the edges of the wound are stitched together and tightened, with chalk and curd spread over it as a powder. A smear is placed over this using ointment, or another kind of medicated paste, then left tight for two to three days before being released.
The treatment is changed and left until the stitches fall out naturally. The wound is then treated with ointment until it heals. The instructions for stitching are to join together, where if the connection has separated either by thread as we described in stomach surgery or by string as you were taught there.
Chapter Twenty Seven.
In the release of the bandage presented in the two lips.
Many people may present to you lumps inside their mouths that are small and firm, resembling some gooseberry lumps, others being smaller or larger. It would be necessary to turn the lip over, cut through each lump, and attach them with string.
Then cut it from every side. After cutting, you fill the site with a poultice of powder until the bleeding stops. Then it is rinsed with vinegar, salt, and remedies are applied to the sites until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty Four.
In cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums which the ancients called 'Apollos.' It should be attached with a string or held with a scraper and cut off at its base. Allow it to drain or bleed for a while then place over the area a poultice of powder.
Or one of the compressed dried necessities, if that flesh returns after treatment, it often returns lean. Cut it again and stitch it; it will not return after severing.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In counting the teeth with iron.
Cystic, coarse and unpleasant scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth from inside and outside as well as between the gums. They can become dominant, turn yellowish, even greenish. This decay can reach the gum causing erosion of the teeth due to that.
You should have the patient seated in front of you on a stone, head raised. You need to scrape off the tooth and the teeth that are showing the scales or resemble sand until nothing is left from them. Do this also with the blackening, greenery and whitening and other such matters until you clean.
If what is inside the first scraping goes away, otherwise redo the process on another day. Then repeat it secondly and thirdly until you reach your goal of the treatment needed. And know that tooth needs different scrapings in various shapes as many forms based on what becomes suitable for your work.
In order that the tooth scraper which scrapes the inside of the tooth is different from the one which scrapes from outside, and the one which scrapes between teeth in another form. These are multiple scraper shapes you have all prepared:".
The thirtieth chapter.
In拔牙.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with every method and refrain from拔牙because there is no back to it if you pull it, for it is a precious essence. Even if it's necessary to extract it.
If the patient decides to remove it, ensure that it is firmly set until you feel the pain subside. Often, the pain of the pus-filled abscess deceives the patient into believing that it is in the correct, healthy tooth, causing them to remove it. However, even after removal, the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth has been removed, as we have witnessed many times from the actions of barbers-surgeons.
If you feel the pain subside at a particular tooth, then it should be that you cut around the root with an awl, exerting some force in certain places. This allows for the removal of gum from all sides. Then, gently move your fingers or very soft forceps to loosen the tooth little by little until it is ready for extraction.
Then, he enables the two large tweezers to grip well and places the patient's chin between his knees where it has been poked deeply so that it doesn't move. Then, he draws out the tooth straight, lest it breaks. If it does not come out and if it does, take one of those tools and gently slide them under him from all sides with care, moving it like you did before.
If the tooth is deeply embedded or stuck, it should be that you fill that hole with a probe and塞塞it properly with a soft delicate tip so as not to fall out when you pull on it with forceps. It should also pierce gently around the gum from all sides until it feels smooth.
Exert your effort to avoid breaking it, for some will remain and may re-inflect the patient with a pain greater than his first. Do not do what the ignorant barbers do in their bridge by pulling out teeth without using the described methods.
Many people undergo extensive operations where the nail breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Either, it happens that some of the jawbone is extracted as we have seen many times. After its removal, if a drink or a paste made from flour and salt is used for gargling, if there's bleeding from the site, this occurs frequently. In that case, slightly crush something from the za'aj (an ingredient) and use it to fill the area.
Otherwise, if the za'aj doesn't help you, consider using the slender and flexible kind of forceps that moves the nail originally. These have long handles and thick grips so they don't bend when you grasp them with your fingers. And this is the characteristic of large forceps:.
They should be as you see, thick at the handles so they do not bend even when gripping them. They should have short handles, made of Indian iron or strong forged steel with smooth ends and a tip where some of them fit into each other for a tight and secure grip.
The ends can also be made like scissors, being strong for control.
Chapter five and thirteenth.
In extracting the roots of nails and removing broken jaw bones.
If part of the nail root breaks during extraction, it is necessary to place cotton dipped in fat for one or two days so that the area relaxes. Then, you introduce gauze or forceps into the site. They should resemble the ends of a bird's beak called blawija, and this is the characteristic of forceps:.
They should be made like scissors from the inside or like a sickle. If these forceps are not suitable for removing them, it may be necessary to dig around the root and reveal all of the flesh with the pliers, then introduce an instrument that resembles a small mallet, as shown below:.
A short tip, the end is slightly thick and not smooth so as to break. If it leaves in that manner or else use these other tools depicted here, one of which has a triangular end with some thickness.
A nice triangular image:.
And we also rely on this tool with two arms, which is also depicted here:
And also other tools and hammers which are mentioned in the inventory of medical instruments, we also rely on this tool that resembles a large furnace as depicted here:.
The triangular tip is reinforced with some slight thickness so as not to break, and it is not smooth. Know that medical instruments are numerous, as are all other tools which are almost countless. The skilled toolmaker adapts his creations according to the work and diseases themselves, he may invent tools for himself based on what they indicate.
For there are diseases that I did not mention their first principles tools for the variety of their kinds, if a bone from the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, then inspect it in its place with whatever suits him among one of these tools and the hammers that I mentioned in removing the roots.
And we rely on this pair, as depicted:
It will have some slight thickness to adjust the bone so that it doesn't slip until the bone is removed, and we force its place with drugs that are suitable for this, if there is decay in the bone then remove it from its decay and darkness until it becomes clean, then treat it until it is cured.
The second and thirtieth chapter.
In the spreading of germinating roots on another.
If the hair grows out of its natural pathway, it becomes unsightly in appearance. This is especially true if this occurs in women and slaves. One should check if the hair has grown from behind another hair.
And if it cannot be spread or pulled, he will extract it; and if it is adhering to the hair of another, he will cut both with this instrument which you see here.
It resembles a small beak, and it should be made of sharp-pointed Indian iron. Its cutting edge will serve you on many occasions due to the toughness of the hair, without disturbing the rest of the hairs. And if it is one that has grown in securely for its warmth, pull it out with an Indian hair plucker which appearance you see here.
It should be entirely from India and its engraving is extremely fine, like the tweezers you make for hair removal. It cools off the hair gradually over many days gently to avoid disturbing the hair causing it to fall out; then grab it again with a few more threads and remove it with some wax afterwards.
And if a hair has broken off from its root, it can hurt the tongue when speaking. Therefore, one should also pull out this hair until the sharpness of that break disappears and the hair smoothly touches the skin without hurting the tongue or disturbing speech.
The thirty-first chapter.
In combing movable hair with threads of silver or gold.
If shown to the old hair, it wiggles and moves upon a tap or fall. The dog can't eat anything on which treatment has been applied as it would cause the hair to fall out. Despite this, no remedy helped in treating it.
The trick in this is to pull with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver will bend and deteriorate after a few days while gold remains unchanged forever. This does not subject it to such changes, and the thread is medium in hardness and toughness according to what fits between the fingers.
A diagram for meshing: Take the thread and insert it between the two correct fingers, then weave the ends of the thread between one or more moving fingers until you reach the correct finger on the other side by weaving.
Then you repeat the weaving from where you started, pulling your hand gently and wisely so as not to move the string, with your thread's tension at the base of the fingers in order for it not to slip. Then cut off the slack end of the thread with scissors, gather both ends together and tie them with a knot, hiding them between the correct finger and the moving finger.
In order to avoid tongue sores, leave it thus tied. If it dislodges or breaks, tighten it with another thread and you can enjoy it like this forever. Here is a depiction of the fingers and the meshing mechanism in two correct fingers and two moving fingers as seen:
One or both fingers may return to their original position after falling back into place and meshing as described, remaining in this state. It is the saddler's companion who performs this task, he carves bone from cattle bones to create finger-like structures and places them in the location where a finger had been. It is tied as we described, remaining so that one may enjoy it.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the band that is exposed under the tongue, it prevents speaking.
This band that is displayed under the tongue may either be naturally born in humans or be postoperative, resulting from a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the mouth of the patient and placing his head on your lap, lifting his tongue then cutting this nervous band across until the tongue is released from its hold. If there's some stiffness or complexity in it due to a healed wound, insert a needle into it and cut it across until the band dissolves and the knot is resolved.
Be cautious not to cut deep into the flesh, as you might sever a blood vessel causing profuse bleeding. After cutting, rinse the area with rose water or a mixture of lemon juice and cold water. Then place a cotton wick under the tongue which the patient holds in their mouth every night.
To prevent it from reattaching, should there be bleeding, place a powdered plaster on the area. If blood dominates, cover the spot with an eyeglass sapphire stone that is suitable for this purpose. Then treat him with all other remedies until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In removing the fly that is born under the tongue.
A lump resembling a small fly may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function. It might even grow large enough to fill the mouth. The treatment involves opening the mouth of the patient facing the sun and examining the lump.
If you see it as a purple or black, hard mass that the patient does not feel any sensation in, do not touch it as it is cancerous. However, if it appears yellow with moisture, insert a needle into it and gently cut through it with small scissors, freeing it from all sides.
If your blood overwhelms you during your work, apply a powdered plaster to it until the bleeding stops. Then resume your work until its completion and then wash with vinegar and salt.
Then, treat him/her with all the appropriate remedies until he/she recovers.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of breast tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors may expose glands inside the throat that resemble those that appear externally, called breasts. If these are treated with what has been mentioned in the section, they do not recover.
Observe; if the tumor is hard, like a patch of skin with little sensation, it should not be exposed to iron. If it is red in color and its texture is firm, do not expose it to iron either for fear of bleeding. Leave it until it ripens. Either it may soften or explode on itself.
And if it is white in color, long-shaped, and its root is delicate; this should be cut. The procedure for treatment involves observing before the operation whether the heat inside the tumor has fully settled or if there's a slight decrease in warmth compared to what was expected.
And then, place the patient with their feet towards the sun and their head on your stone. Open their mouth and take a servant between your hands; you extract their tongue to the bottom with this tool, which looks like this:.
It is made of silver or brass, being as thin as a knife. When you insert it into the tongue and see where the tumor lies and notice your sight on it, take a tool and pierce through the breast and pull it out from what can be pulled without pulling anything with it from the tissues.
Then cut it using this machine, its appearance resembles a pair of scissors but each of its ends is bent. The mouth of each one has two sharp shoes made entirely from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If you do not prepare this machine, then cut it with a file like this:
It is sharp on one side and not on the other. After cutting one nut, you cut the other in exactly the same way. Then after cutting, it should be rubbed with cold water or soap and water.
If it bleeds when exposed, rub it with water that has been boiled with the peels of tamarinds or banana leaves and so on until bleeding stops. Then treat it accordingly until it heals, and new hair grows in addition to the two nuts which may also have to be cut as described for cutting the nuts.
A woman was treated for a growth that had appeared inside her throat, nearly blocking the sense of smell and making it impossible for her to eat or drink as she could only breathe through a narrow passage.
She was on the brink of death if she had survived another day or two. The growth had grown to a point where it produced two branches, even going through her nostrils. I acted quickly and pierced one of them with a drill. Then by pulling it out, she pulled out a suitable piece.
Then I cut it at the point where it appeared through her nostril, then did the same for what had protruded from the other nostril. Then she opened her mouth and tightened her tongue, then pierced the drill into the tumor itself, cutting off some of it without removing much blood.
The excerpt describes a surgical procedure on a woman. She would have her hair cut and immediately start drinking water, then she would eat. The process continues by repeatedly cutting the tumor for a long period of time until the tumor is replaced rather than being completely removed.
The procedure involved opening and removing a tumor inside the throat. It stopped increasing then I moved away from the situation, not knowing what God did with her afterwards.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing the tumor of the belly.
The one that is called Anaba when it sinks down to the belly and swells up, being white and rectangular. If it is hard at the bottom and tapering off, then it is also called Anaba; if a treatment as described in the section does not heal it, then the healing will not take place.
I saw the hot tumor that had ceased to bother her, it was thin and one should consider cutting it. It did not form a long collection and it did not have length; it was soft or of the same color as blood or black or without sensation; one should avoid cutting it.
In it, there is a treatment for the feeble. If she is seen to have the characteristics that were mentioned of her whiteness and length, then one should advise the feeble to wear sandals in the sun and use the tool described while licking her tongue with it. Then she should insert the needle into the tumor.
And draw it downwards, and cut it with one of the two tools that I mentioned in cutting the two nuts, you should only cut what exceeds natural necessity by no more. Because if you cut any more, you would harm speech and language.
Then after amputation, one uses what we described in the section about the removal of the two nuts and treats it until it heals. If dairy from the pus of its removal is to be expected, it should use the method within it without fear or caution. The reason for this procedure is the rapid medicine, which means to place the head of the pus under your pillow.
Then he presses his tongue with the device we mentioned, then takes of the hot water that was mentioned in the section about kneading and mixes it with unextinguished grain flour while making sure it isn't too thick nor too thin. She fills this device with such mixture, here is its appearance:.
One end of it, where you place the medicine, looks like a spoon's stirrer. The device is placed on the patient's tongue with pus lying on its side so that saliva can drain from inside his/her mouth without anything reaching into their throat and potentially harming them.
Then, hold your hand on the medicine and press it against the tongue for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the sting of the medicine subsides. If desired, take a cotton thread, twist it at one end like a rod, and soak the thread in the medicine.
The cotton thread dipped in the medicine is inserted into a tube from above, causing it to stick onto the tongue. She does this repeatedly until she achieves her desired amount of treatment for the gum. Then, she leaves it as it will soften and shrink after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medication, do it again.
After the gum treatment, clean around the gum with a cotton dipped in oil and wipe away any remaining medicine. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with applicators and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than surgery and avoids unnecessary fear.
The treatment for that also includes the mildest form of cauterization, where excisions are treated with burning on this compound. The ingredients taken include thuja, zov, cistus, saffron, vinegar, poppy seed and similar herbs which are gathered all together or some of them in a pot and soaked in water.
And boil it, the pot being heated inside the wisdom's belly. In the center of the lid, there should be a hole on which the dehydrating machine is placed on this compound, made from silver or copper:
The end containing the cautery is inserted into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the treatment on the tube, until the treatment becomes perfectly hot and then repeat it several times until it disappears. You should not make this treatment at the first sign of a tumor.
Indeed, it often increases the tumor, but you should do this when her hot tumor is subsiding. If this device does not accompany you, take a pipe and place an eggshell on its end so that it does not burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth, this is an effective treatment with its safety.
The thirty-first section.
In removing splinters and anything else that appears in the throat.
It often appears in the throat, bones or thick splinters or other things. It should be removed what was visible and fell into one's view after licking with the device under the sun.
To show you what is in the throat, and what did not appear to you and has hidden in the throat; it should be induced vomiting before his food digests in his stomach. Maybe the thing that appears would come out through vomiting or maybe the patient would swallow a piece of meat or some bones.
Eating a piece of hard bread or taking a piece of the soft sea sponge, tying it with thread, then eating it. If it reaches the place of the sickle, quickly pull the string and do this several times.
Often the sickle or bone sticks to it and comes out, if it doesn't come out as described otherwise use a device made of lead like this.
It is usually a little longer than the swab, at its end there is an applicator that enters into a loop in the throat gently while lifting his head upwards and being careful not to irritate his throat so as not to cause him to cough. He pushes the bone or the sickle with it, or the doctor may enter it with his hand.
And inserting the swab into it is better for him to know the location of the emerging thing and pushes it down or pulls his hand with the device upwards, all of this according to what he has prepared himself until he can remove it.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing the痰 emerging in the throat.
If treatment with what we have instructed in the chapter regarding treatment with medicine did not work, then look at the throat of the swab after squeezing his tongue with the tool you were shown.
If you see the痰, use a small hook or a soft but firm tweezer to grab it. If this doesn't work and otherwise take a curved tube and insert it into the throat of the swab close to the痰 then put a hot rod inside the tube covered with fire.
You do this several times and the swab endures not drinking water all day, then he takes a glass filled with cold water opens his mouth with it and rinses with it without swallowing a drop, and moves the water around in his mouth occasionally with his hand.
If the gallbladder drops onto the table when it senses water, if it does not come out as described, then the throat evaporates with urine and the stomach with the device described in the incense of God. It does this several times; then it falls.
The purpose of the incense is to take a quantity containing fever sweat from heat, and the amount covered by a lid in its center has a hole. Then a part of the apparatus is assembled inside that hole. The incense is then put into the mouth at one end of the tube, and the nozzle is sealed so that no incense comes out until it is known that the incense has reached his throat.
If the gallbladder drops onto the table, if it does not drop out and otherwise, incense is repeated several times, and the bile endures thirst, eats salt and garlic and onion, and does not drink water. Without doubt, this treatment will make it come out, and this is an example of a device that attracts the gallbladder from the throat when it falls under sight.
She resembles the keys as you see, except that she has this suture that enters the throat and its ends resemble the bird's mouth in her roughness of the cold if it touched something without leaving it.
Another device is used to suck the tongue, it's a wide iron ring that can hold the mouth as much as possible above the tongue. It enters the mouth standing on one side, causing the mouth to remain open involuntarily and the bile cannot pull it out until it moves:
The description of the device used to open the mouth at this specific measure is provided here.
Section Forty.
In this, he makes speech about the swelling of the bladder and its division.
Tumors are numerous and diversified in kind, according to what this book lays down one by one, and they differ with respect to their softness and cleavage from two aspects. The first being of the tumor itself and what it contains from moisture.
The second aspect is by the locations where they occur in the body, as a tumor that occurs in the head is different from the tumor that occurs in the abdomen, and the tumor that occurs in an area of muscle不同于 one that occurs in a joint. Each has its own rule for treatment.
Among tumors, some should not be removed until the pus inside has ripened and reached its completeness. Others should be removed without waiting for complete ripening; this is where the pus has not fully matured like those that occur close to joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and prolongs its course until it infects the surrounding areas, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, becoming a cause for paralysis of that limb or because the tumor is close to a major body part.
Because delaying the removal until it ripens harms that major body part, or if it's near the abdomen, remove it as an intention, not waiting. However, a tumor should be removed with intention even though it has not fully ripened when near the abdomen, lest it pus and spread into the abdomen becoming rampant.
There will be cases where it does not heal, and you should know when to remove tumors that have fully ripened. This is when the pain in the tumor subsides, fever disappears, redness decreases, swelling diminishes, and all other signs are present.
It is necessary to make the incision at the bottom of the tumor's location if possible, as this makes it easier for pus to drain downwards or towards the highest point of the tumor and provides a tighter seal. The incision should run along the body length when dealing with tumors in the arms and legs.
In the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries and so on especially in flat areas without curvature. If the tumor is in curved areas, it should be cut according to that location. However, if the lump is in fatty tissue areas, it would be better to leave a margin.
Until it solidifies as we said on completion, if you prick it before that, its secretion will last longer and be abundant with impurities. It might also harden its lips and cavity, and some tumors may need to be pricked across the body's width or according to what the organ needs.
It is necessary to use one incision for small tumors and a wide or multiple incision for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may require skin excision and cutting if they have become like a wound.
It has reached a point where it has become like what is often found in many abscesses and hiding places. Some of them have three angular cuts, while others are cut like an ace card shape, as is the case with the tumor of the arrector pili muscle.
Some of them use the circular cut and the crescent-shaped cut, among other cuts. If it doesn't have a head like the flattened spreading tumor, then only one simple incision is necessary. And if the tumor is large and has been there for a long time with multiple pricks, then it should not rush to remove all pus at once.
But remove some of it, then tighten the tumor to another day, and also remove some pus. Do this repeatedly progressively until you extract all of it.
And especially if the patient's strength is weak, or they are pregnant women or children or elderly people. The animal spirit often dissolves with each removal of pus, and it might be possible that the patient dies without you noticing; so beware of this matter very cautiously.
After the removal of these tumors, it is necessary to clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor's incision was small or if there was a single simple cut, use cotton wadding or old cotton cloth for treatment. However, if the tumor was large and had many cuts, other methods should be employed.
You should insert wadding into each incision so that some of it reaches together. If the tumor has cut into the skin or eroded parts of it, you should stuff it with old cotton or undampened cloth camel wool, then tighten it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs while you're working, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a cotton cloth in them and holding it on the bleeding spot multiple times.
If bleeding persists, you should use the measures, treatments, and procedures that we have described in many parts of this book and its divisions. If you are in winter and the tumor is sensitive to nerves, it may be necessary to warm up the tubes with a hot drink and oil.
Place it on the site, if you are in summer and the places are hot, carry the tubes with a cold drink of water or oil or a cold drink mixed with oil. As we said, until the third day, as the tumor should dissolve and be cleaned.
You should use what is needed until it heals, this is what you need to know about treating tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have explained how to treat each tumor, making summaries accordingly.
The fourth chapter and forty.
In the incision on the tumors that appear in the scalp's skin.
Small tumors are exposed in the scalp skin. These belong to a category of goods that its kinds include hereditary traits like chicken's egg and various types, among which some are fatty others contain moisture similar to the slime.
And some contain moisture that resembles the mud and soup, and so on, while others are stone-hard. All of them do not pose any risk in making an incision and removing them as long as there's no artery obstructing when you make the incision.
When it comes to making the incision, you should first cut it open with the tool that appears after this instruction and is called the probe, in order to determine what's inside. If it contains moisture, make an incision along its length in a simple manner as shown in this diagram:.
Start by making the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~, if moisture spills out, remove the sac that was containing this moisture and cut it completely, leaving not a single piece behind as often more returns when there is something left.
Then, dip a cotton ball in the clarified butter if available, or in salt water, fill the wound with it and leave it for another day. It eats what is left of the sac, then re-dip the wound in the clarified butter again and thirdly if needed.
Until you are sure that nothing is left of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty goods, make an incision in this way:.
Make a hard incision and insert the forceps into both sides of the wound, remove it from all directions and put your utmost effort in extracting the clot that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do as described to you afterwards and also do so if the tumor is hardened by making the incision like this.
The specific treatment is as described, and cutting on the necrotic tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. There may be some of these tumors in the head in certain people that literally have no moisture at all; this is due to cutting onto a tumor there.
I lifted the head of an old woman and found a tumor like a hard, chalky white stone. It couldn't be broken even if one tried to crack it, and no one could shatter it even if they threw it; this was unlike other head tumors that occur in adults as compared to those that may appear on the heads of children.
And when it comes to the ears, cut all of them with a simple incision and make its bend at the bottom so that the material can flow downwards easily. Then treat it according to what suits its treatment.
The second and forty-first section.
In the incision on pigs, which are often found around the neck, these tumors tend to appear in the neck and under the elbows, as well as in the armpits. They may also appear in other parts of the body; it can be one that appears around the neck or multiple ones, with some developing from others.
Every pig from this group has its own special abdominal cavity inside, similar to that found in livestock and head tumors as described. There are many types of pigs ranging from those with hardened tissues, to those containing moisture, and some of them being poisonous which do not respond to treatment.
I observed some of them which were well in condition under touch, their appearance was close to the skin color and they could move towards every direction. They were not attached to the neck nerve, lymph node or artery and did not seem to be infected. It would be necessary to cut them with a simple incision from the top down on the body like this, in line '~a~' to line '~b~':.
Cut her from every side and expand the skin flaps with a scalpel or two, or many if necessary, as we said about head tumours. Remove it little by little and make it on the neck so that it does not cut off sweat or nerves, let the incisor be not extremely sharp.
So as not to increase your hand with cutting or disturb the patient, cut what you do not need to cut. If you cut sweat glands or arteries and they hindered your work, put a poultice of powder in the wound or some walnuts that stop bleeding.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the tumor's pain subsides and the wound relaxes, ready for healing. The bleeding stops then, return to your work until you finish, then use your sensitive finger to check if there is any remaining tissue, remove and clean it further.
If there is a large sweat gland in the root of the pig, it would be best not to cut this part from its root. Instead, you should tie it with a tight double thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without causing harm. After that, stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian rose water, then treat it.
If you cut the pig entirely, it is necessary to gather the wound's edges and sew it up with a thread after ensuring that there is no leftover fat. If I see that there was still leftover bone of the pig.
It is necessary that you refer to cutting its root and trunk, using the stitches and what we mentioned. If pigs contain moisture, soak them in a simple water bath where it will show you their ripening place and make the water go downwards as we said.
Then, after the putrefaction is removed from the wound, apply ointments like the Egyptian one to consume any remaining decay until you see that the wound has healed. Afterward, treat it with herbal astringents for the flesh until it fully recovers.
The forty-third chapter.
In the case of a tumor that occurs within the throat.
I mentioned this method of making a cut in the throat regarding a tumor inside the larynx. I have not seen anyone do it in our country, and that is their way of speaking. However, those who suffer from heartburn should avoid making such a cut as they do not benefit from it.
In order for all the veins and lungs to be moist, while if they have a hot tumor in their mouth or throat or lungs, if there is no cause due to choking, it becomes necessary to use making a cut in the throat to relieve the pain that comes from suffocation.
If we want to do this, we should cut the throat below three circles of the pipe or make four small cuts across in what is between two circles as much as the cut is in the trachea not in the cartilage. This position corresponds to the cut.
Because it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are far away, if the doctor is a coward, he should stretch the larynx skin with gauze. Then cut the skin until he reaches the pipe next to the blood vessels; if he sees something from them.
Then he makes the incision in the trachea as we described, and uses the presence of phlegm coming out from it along with coughing and interruption of sound to guide him; leaving the wound open for a time. Then when the time that made him fear suffocation has passed, he joins the lips of the wound together with the skin.
And one of its parts without the fatty tissue, then medications are used that stimulate wound healing until it heals. He who wrote this book explains this sentence that we narrated, saying: This is when they saw the pus filling his neck with one of these tumors they mentioned.
The pus filled up the dying man's throat and he feared it would lead to his death, so they went to make a slit in the throat for him, so that the pus could relieve some of the pressure at the wound site and save him from death. They were instructed not to close the incision until the course of illness completes its cycle which lasts three days approximately.
Then they were ordered to stitch up the wound and treat it until recovery. The one who witnessed this himself saw a servant taking a knife, sending him to cut her neck; he cut some of the bronchial tube. She was summoned for treatment. I found her choking as she would choke before being slaughtered. The wound was exposed.
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was minimal, which made me realize she hadn't cut too deeply or torn any muscles. The wind was able to pass through the wound and she felt relieved after stitching up the wound and treating it until her recovery. The servant only experienced a strain in his voice with no further complications.
She recovered after some days to her best health, from which we can conclude that making a slit in the throat poses no danger.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the incision on the tumor that presents from outside in the trachea, it is called the tracheal cyst.
This tumor, which is called the tracheal cyst, is a large body in color of the body and it's common in women. It has two types.
Either naturally or supernaturally, if it's natural there is no remedy and if it's supernatural it can be in two ways. The first one is similar to fatty goods and the second way is like a tumor that arises from knotting of veins and danger lies in its fissure. It should not be exposed to iron except what is small among them. If it's pricked and examined with a sword, its fibres resemble fatty goods and are not attached to anything of the veins; it should be cut like cutting on fatty goods. And remove it with what contains the sac if it's in a sac and otherwise, investigate all of them. Then, treat the area with whatever appropriate treatment should be.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the slit for types of fatty goods.
Fatty goods come in many types and I have listed all of them in the previous chapter. It is necessary to explain here the difference between fatty goods (sallah) and discharge, which involves a problem; hence, I say that discharge accompanies fever, inflammation, and alarming pain until the excess of benefit subsides. The pus continues until then the fever and intensity subside. Fatty goods do not accompany it with heat or fever or pain; they have a special bag for themselves, which has the color of the body. It begins like mustard seeds and becomes like a small seedling, varying in size from bigger to smaller ones.
It is of two types, either fatty or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are numerous as mentioned in the previous chapter. When treating fatty goods, you should prick and examine them first with an instrument called the sword as shown in the following section.
The magnitude of the tumor, then remove the probe and observe what comes out from it. If a watery exudate emerges regardless of its color, cut it with a simple incision as mentioned for all tumors in other sections. If no watery exudate comes out from after removing the probe, know that it is oily or shamy.
Cut it with a firm cut as shown in this image, as I taught you, and hang it on the stakes. Gently peel off the skin from every side. Preserve the bag if you can remove it intact along with the product.
If the bag breaks during surgery and you couldn't remove it intact, this happens quite often. Remove it piece by piece until nothing is left. If there's still something from it remaining, whether a little or a lot, the product will return to its original state most of the time.
If you have the upper hand and only a little remains, make the incision large when you finish by using some sharp thick needles and pulling on the wound. Secure it with something that cools down the hot tumor and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the product is large, draw its edges and treat it with what seals it.
If you encounter a harmful or non-harmful sweat that causes bleeding, act promptly by spreading the dust plaster on the area and leave it tightened for two or three days until the wound heals and the blood stops flowing. Then proceed with removing what is left of the product.
The sixtieth chapter.
In images of the machines.
Those which operate in the cut and hardness of it, images of the probes are three types among them the large ones, the medium ones, and the small ones.
A large artery image:.
A mid-point needle image:.
A small needle image:.
Made from iron and steel, quadrangular with tight corners to facilitate entry into tumors. These are tools called cauterizers or 'the hot', consisting of three types: large, medium, and small. A picture of a large file:.
A picture of a medium file:
A picture of a small file:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, bones and other contents inside them. It is made of a smooth, polished drill like a chisel or a steel blade from Chinese steel or Spanish steel, or iron or silver. The best among these are those made from Spanish steel.
Files can also be made from black lead. They are suitable for smoothing out nails that have obstacles within them to guide their curvature along with these obstacles. These too come in three types: some of them are long, others are medium-length, and the others are short.
The size of the hole in each nail is adjusted according to its needs, making it as hard as the width and narrowness of the nail. A picture of a large lead file:.
A picture of an intermediate lead file:.
A picture of a small lead file:.
Images of the pins; there are many types as some have a single file, and they are three kinds: large, medium, and small. There are blind pins which are also divided into three types. There are pins with two files, which are also divided into three types. There are also conical pins with two files, these are also three types. These are three types, and among them are the tubes with three passageways. They are also three types, each one of these needs its place in its respective position; a simple large model of an apparatus. A simple model of an apparatus in the middle. A simple small model of an apparatus.
A large dark model of an apparatus. A dark model of an apparatus in the middle.
A small dark model of an apparatus.
A large model of an apparatus with two handles. A model of an apparatus in the middle with two handles. A small model of an apparatus with two handles.
A large model of an apparatus with three openings.
A model of an apparatus in the middle with three openings. A small model of an apparatus with three openings.
These are the scalpels used for cutting and incising goods and tumors, they come in three types as some are large, some are medium-sized, and some are small. A picture of a large scalpel:.
A picture of an average scalpel:.
A picture of a small scalpel:.
Its blades are limited where it makes cuts, and the rest of its ends are unlimited. It was made this way to rely on it for cutting goods when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, so it reduces the sensation of pain during tumor incision and provides some relief from the burning sensation he feels during tumor excision.
These are illustrations of traps and they come in three types depending on their size, some being large, others medium-sized, and the others small; illustration of a large trap.
It is made of a semi-hard zinc, which has an irregular shape. In each end there is a broad spoon-like object that forms the handle of a pliers in its head; it contains a hidden incision like a bird's tongue, which can be moved inside and outside as desired, just as you see.
The illustrations of the pliers that are placed between the fingers when pressing tumors, which do not bother the patient, come in three types depending on their size, some being large, others medium-sized, and the smaller ones; illustration of a large clamp:.
Illustrations of the clamps used to stop bleeding, which come in three types depending on their size, some being large, others medium-sized, and smaller ones; illustration of a large clamp:.
They are made of bronze or have a slightly tapered Chinese wheel, as you see. It is necessary for these types of clamps to be large and small with you so that you can quickly stop the bleeding when needed, and when medicine isn't available.
However, they are not used for every place in the body when it comes to bloodletting, but rather they are used in muscular areas such as the calf muscle, thigh, arm muscles, breast, abdomen and the prostate area and so on in the moist muscular organs.
And you can make other small devices from it that resemble the shells of the almond like this figure shows.
It is used to stop bleeding if it starts from the place of fracture or when cutting a vein or artery. It can be made like this illustration shows:.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the armpit of men.
The one that resembles the armpit of women can swell up in some people's armpits even to resemble the armpit of women, becoming dirty and unpleasant. If someone dislikes this, it may be advisable to cut through the armpit with a crescent-shaped incision like this.
From line b to line g:. Then, remove all the fat. Afterwards, fill the wound with ointment for healing and then stitch together both edges of the incision properly. Take care to heal it until it is fully recovered. If after that, the armpit sinks down due to its size like in women's case, no further treatment is required.
It may be necessary to make two cuts at the upper sides of it resembling a crescent shape, each one connecting with the other at its ends so that the larger line encompasses the smaller one as shown in this illustration:. From line b to line g, then cut the skin in between the two cuts. Remove all fat from this area and use the stitching and needle techniques as mentioned along with any necessary treatment until it heals properly.
If a larger cut is required due to concern or bleeding, you should stuff the wound with cotton saturated in the ointment and leave it until all remaining fat has been absorbed. Then, take care of its healing until full recovery occurs.
Chapter forty-four.
In the belly of the tumors that appear below the elbow.
These tumors that appear below the elbow are of piggy types contained in a bag. Some of them contain moisture, so if any of them contains moisture, it should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision like this.
From line B to line G. If you have drained all the contents of the tumor over the duration, remove it with cotton wool and leave it until another day, then remove the cotton wool.
And treat with the suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the piggy type that contains a lump, cut it as we described in the cut for pigs; either way. If the wound gets to the point of pus discharge, use the knife in accordance with what we mentioned previously.
Chapter ninety-four.
In the incision of the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, it is called aneurisma.
If the artery is cut and the skin above it heals, it often causes a tumor to appear. Similarly, a vein can also cause a swelling or tumor within it.
And the signs by which one can identify if the tumor or swelling is due to an artery or a vein: If the tumor originates from the artery, it appears elongated and gathered in depth within the body. And when you push on the tumor with your finger, it feels like there's a hollow sound.
The one that comes from the vein is for the tumor to be long and superficial within the body. The incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially in areas like the elbow, axilla, neck, and many other parts of the body. These were very big indeed, it should be avoided treating them with iron.
Also, avoid anything that may harm the limbs or head. If there is an enlargement of the artery, make a cut in the skin longitudinally then open the cut with incisions, then strip the artery and remove the clots from it.
Until it is revealed, then introduce a needle and insert it to the other side, pulling the artery with two threads at the points you have determined in piercing the arteries that are in the grooves. Then pinch the place between the ligaments until all blood comes out from there.
The tumor is then dissolved, and treatment that produces pus is used until the ligaments fall. Then it is treated with ointments suitable for this, until it heals.
If the tumor is from the cut in a vein, it may be necessary to hold as much of the tumor with your hand along with the skin. Then insert a needle below the place where you held with your hand and extend it in a thread until it comes out on the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly as described to you for tying grapes on both ends of the thread, if you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the crossing point of the first needle.
Tighten your threads at four points, then cut the tumor in the middle until what is inside comes out. Cut off some excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil on it. Then treatment with fomentation and ointments is used until complete healing occurs.
Chapter Fifty.
In the tumor that shows nerve entanglement.
Just as a tumor that appears in the artery and vein, so too does a tumor appear in nerves when they are struck or experience extreme fatigue, or something akin. It is more prevalent in areas of bending and curvature.
And wherever joints move, there is a moving tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body and it usually doesn't cause pain. If one presses hard on it, one feels numbness similar to that of anesthetic. The tumor isn't deeply set within the body.
But it's under the skin, moving in every direction but not going forward or backward. Whatever is found near joints should not be exposed to iron as it might cause damage. If found in head areas or forehead, this does not apply.
Cut the skin with scissors. If the tumor is small, hold it with tweezers and cut it off at the root. If it's large, tie it with a string and remove it. Then take it out and stitch up the wound until it heals.
The fifty-first section.
In the excision of swellings that appear in the abdomen.
A number of people have experienced swellings, often called fungal-like swellings because they resemble fungi. Their body is thin at the root but its head is thick and hard, possibly transforming into them, with some being small and others becoming significantly large.
I have seen a man with two things in his abdomen that resembled fungi. They were white and thin at their roots, but thickened near the tips. Their tips cracked continuously, secreting moisture constantly. I removed them; each weighed around 14 ounces or so.
When performing operations on such cuts, one should observe if the pus is present and if the color of the pus when wet and fine-textured is white. In this case, cut it with a broad scalpel and may be kept near the iron in fire as often there is excessive blood discharge during cutting.
If the blood overflow, seal it. If you see pus hard and fear cutting with steel, take a tight lead thread and pull the pus which is its nature, leave it for two days then increase pulling on the lead; it will continue to pull the lead.
Pull the pus until it breaks and falls out by itself without any effort. If the pus is thick, during cutting there will be some shock and suction especially when in the stomach region, but perhaps half of it or some parts could be cut.
Then seal it so that it doesn't recur, then treat the wound until it heals. Beware not to leave pus as it can come back. The appearance of little white pus with a smelly smell might be indicative of cancer, which we will discuss later.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In treating scabies.
Scabies can be caused by many factors, either from the splitting of the umbilical duct on the belly which lets pus or meconium come out, or from blood that leaks from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or it may also result from wind that gets trapped.
If it's due to the splitting of the umbilical duct and pus coming out, then the color of the tumor resembles that of the body and it is soft without pain, and shows different appearances. And if it was due to bleeding before, his condition is the most different when compared to what we described. If you pinch him with your fingers, he disappears then returns. And maybe there's a stone and a lot of enlargement happens upon going to the toilet or intense fatigue. If it was due to moisture before, then it would be greasy.
And it doesn't disappear if you pinch him with your hand, nor increase or decrease. If the reason was bleeding before, then with these signs, the tumor turns black. If the reason was soft flesh before, then the tumor is hard and firm, staying at one point.
And if it was due to wind before, touching him is greasy. The action in this regard is to observe: If the skin condition below originates from blood of the artery or vein or wind, then one should refrain from treating it because there's fear and temptation as I informed you in the chapter that discusses tumors arising from arteries and veins.
And if the condition below originates from the effusion or pus, you should command the patient to hold himself and stand upright, then learn around the area with your finger. Then, command him to lie between your hands on his back. Then cut with a broad scalpel around the area at the spot you learned through probing. Then extend the center of the tumor upwards with a large spatula. Then secure the cut site with strong silk or linen string, tying it tightly.
And the band's knot is elastic. Then open in the middle of the constricted tumor above the band, and insert your index finger into it. If you find that the band has taken the contents, relax the elasticity and push the contents back inside the body. If you find pus, extend it with a spatula.
Remove its fatty cover, if it obstructs a vessel or artery, bind it tightly and continue with your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. Enter the threads into the channel you created around the tumor, which you have already made straight. Then pull on the tumor in four different places using the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the position until the tightened flesh decays and falls off on its own or cut it when it thickens and decays. Then treat it with whatever is appropriate from ointments until it heals. If it was a part of new flesh in the cut, then after healing you should stitch it again.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should excise the tumor as we said and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it. Then treat it with what will heal the place.
The fifty-third chapter.
In treating cancer.
We have mentioned in this section the types of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, warning against treating it with iron as it can cause corrosion. We also talked about cancer that develops in the womb and warned against its treatment.
We mentioned previously that when cancer is in a place that can be completely removed, like breast cancer or thigh tumors and so on, where it can be removed as a whole, especially if it's small at the beginning. However, for large ones, there should not be any attempt to approach them.
I, however, have not been able to heal anyone of it before me and I haven't seen anything like this until now. When the work is possible as we said, you should proceed by alleviating the difficulty from the darkest stage several times then develop it if there's a clear filling within the veins.
Then the doctor establishes a position where he can operate effectively, then receives from the patient the tubes that are suitable for him, and then cuts them from all sides with the skin up to their roots, ensuring no remnants remain. He allows the blood to flow without hastily cutting off anything.
But squeeze the positions and drain all of the thick blood with your hand or through any machines you can utilize. If during surgery, a great gush of blood comes from cutting an artery or vein, stop the bleeding by cooling until it stops, then treat with all remedies until recovery occurs.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of leprosy.
We were informed in the section about types of irrigation and how water assembly occurs, along with signs for each type and treatment using medicines. The one that is treated with iron alone is the tuberculous type. It does not mix with iron the leprosy type or the flesh type at all.
If this treatment has failed, meaning that you have treated the tuberculous type of leprosy with medicines and it did not work, look into whether the patient's weakness was exacerbated or if they had another disease besides leprosy, such as tuberculosis.
If there is coughing or diarrhea, and so on, you should treat it with iron as it can be dangerous. If you see that the patient has abundant strength and does not have any other disease besides leprosy, and they are neither a child nor an old person, then your approach to working in this case should be to stand the patient upright between your hands. And behind the patient, a servant presses his abdomen with their hands and pushes the water downwards towards the elbow area. Then they take on a spinal twist in this position:.
Restrict the cuts to two sides, define the edge like a castrating knife, but there should be some fat left so that it does not injure the organs during surgery. If the pus is generated from the intestines.
You should cut from the groin three fingers downwards to above her ankle, if the pus is produced due to liver disease, your cut should be from the groin down to three fingers. If the pus is due to gallbladder disease, then your cut should be on the right side up to three fingers.
Also, the cut should not be on the side that makes the patient want to lie down, lest the pus spills to that weak area. Then puncture the skin with the instrument completely, then insert the instrument into this cut and raise your hand.
Make the cut with the castrating knife between the skin and the testicle as if you are scraping it, and the amount you scrape should be the size of a thumb or slightly more. Then pierce the scrotum until the castrating knife reaches an empty place which is the water location, then remove it and enter the instrument into this hole which is illustrated.
It is somewhat like a tube made of thin tubing, it's made of silver or copper or polished steel. At its bottom, there's a small hole and on its sides, two holes are made from the left side and one from the right side as you see.
And it may place its tip in a manner resembling the nib of a quill pen, as shown here:.
In the top of it, there is a loop. If the instrument reaches water, it drops from its sheath onto the instrument, draining the water in an average amount of time. For if you drain more than what should be drained within this time, the patient might die due to the breakdown of their animal soul.
If he has a deep coma approaching death, but drain him according to his strength and what indicates his condition of high pulse strength and good color, then remove the apparatus and hold back water, for he would withhold from his regular time.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the chest which I told you to apply this condition on, then remove the apparatus again another day if I see the patient capable for this.
And also remove the small amount of water, do this for days while you are on guard and avoid mistakes so that only a little water remains. If you feel anxious about the patient and leave a significant amount of water, bury it in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the steam room and under the sun, make him endure thirst and treat him with dried medicines until he recovers. Afterward, strengthen his stomach, liver, and gallbladder after removing water as described previously.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In treating children who are born and their places of urination are not clean, or if the hole is narrow, or in an incorrect position.
Some boys may be born from their mother's womb and her pubis without being cut, it should be necessary to have a hole for him at the time of birth.
With an extremely fine awl on this picture:.
Then place a very fine copper pin in the hole and bind it, holding it for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, push it back, then return him. If you do not keep the copper rod, it is possible that the urine, having gotten used to the position, will not leave it and may close.
And if it has a narrow hole, then it is treated with lead as we said before, for many days until it widens. And among them are those whose opening is not in its place, that is, they have their opening at the end of the bladder and can't urinate towards the front.
Until it raises the testicles with its hand above and does not allow them to descend until the menstruation cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very bad reason, and the purpose of this practice is for the one who experiences menstruation to lie on his back.
Then, extend it with your left hand for a very strong duration and cleanse the tip of the penis with a razor or a sharp large penknife as if you were carving something to have its center shaped like a bladder so that the hole should occur in the middle as required.
And when you perform your task, be careful not to cause excessive bleeding, for it often leads to dealing with what cuts the blood and treats the wound until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
In the urine that appears in the bladder, kidney, gallbladder, and decay, and when the bladder adheres to the kidney.
This urine often appears in the penis, which is an inflamed epididymis. It can be putrid or not. The non-putrid one should be attached to a mild string.
Cut it until you clean all of it, then apply a cotton soaked in Egyptian vaseline on it. After that, treat it with almond oil until it heals. If the urine is putrid and dark-colored, you should use kaolin after cutting and removing it.
If the urine is inside a hard clot, it does not mix. Some of the urine is inside the clot and some is outside of it. It should be necessary to extract the urine that's inside first until it dissolves. Then use the one from outside.
Because if you treat them both together, the clot may not rupture, and it could also occur in women and within the clot there might be darkness and putrefaction. It should be necessary to remove all that has darkened and what might spoil or has already spoiled.
Then, after that, apply honey mixed with peel of processed and sifted pomegranate along with carshin. Then treat it with all the remedies until it heals. If there is any bleeding occurrence, use kai (a type of herb) by placing it in a Halali mold as follows:
If kai is useful for both conditions, that is bleeding and wounds when they spoil, if the clot accumulates and goes away completely at some point, it should be necessary to insert a lead pipe in the urinary tract as a catheter to drain the urine on top of it. As for the attachment of the clot to the cloture.
This attachment occurs in those whose urinary tract is healthy and has not been surgically treated, and it may occur due to a wound or tumor before treatment. It should be necessary to remove it with an oiled scalpel until the band dissolves and the cloture can resolve from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them through examination, it should be necessary to remove a bit from the cloture and the clot. This is because the urinary tract is thin, and it might rupture quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the urinary tract from the cloture with a fine piece of cotton that has been dipped in cold water to prevent any other kind of attachment.
Then he treats with a tight drink until it heals.
The 75th Chapter.
In purifying children and treating what they might expose themselves to of error.
Castration is nothing more than the separation of connection as with all surgeries, but since it is an act performed by our will upon children in particular, it should be that we implement the best work there.
And the easiest path leading to safety, I say that circumcision was not mentioned in anything of her writings because it wasn't used in their regulations and it is what we have acquired.
By experience, for I found the public among the surgeons and butchers practicing cleansing with Moses' method and using scissors. They also use the clamp and bandage with string, and cutting with a dagger. I have tried all these methods.
And I found that cleansing with scissors and using bandage with string is better than Moses' method, as the latter often causes skin to stick due to the thickness of the foreskin's layers. It may cut off the outer layer leaving the inner one intact.
He may have to perform another cut and experience renewed pain. Circumcision with a knife doesn't remove the end of the foreskin as it might enter through its slit, whereas circumcision with a dagger could result in loss or bad quality work if the boy's skin is naturally short.
Often, they are born already not needing circumcision which I've seen firsthand. But with cleansing using scissors and bandage through string, experience has shown its advantages as the scissor from above is matched in length to that of one below.
When your hand operates at the time when both saws are used equally for one measure in a single moment, the control of the thread becomes almost like a wall to the skin of the scrotum from every aspect. There will be no fault or error whatsoever in this operation. The first face of work is to mislead the child.
And especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his scrotum and leaving him for another day, then make him happy and pleased with every way possible that suits him and what his mind accepts. Then stop him standing before you, towering.
And don't let him sit, hiding the scissors in your armpit or under your foot, there will be no fault from the child on that or anything of the machines. Then enter your hand into his scrotum and inflate the skin and lift it up until the head of the scrotum comes out.
Then cleanse it from what collects there of dirt. Then tie the taught position with a double thread, then lightly tie below that with a second knot. Then hold it with your thumb and the curved bone of your hand at the bottom knot tightly, and cut between the knots. Then lift the skin up quickly and remove the head of the scrotum. Leave a little blood to flow, it is better for preventing scrotum swelling as it's less likely to cause. Then wipe it with a damp cloth. Dust some unburnt charcoal ash on it. It's also preferable, or cornmeal if you have any, both are very effective.
Then lift the skin up quickly and remove the head of the scrotum. Leave a little blood to flow, it is better for preventing scrotum swelling as it's less likely to cause. Then wipe it with a damp cloth. Dust some unburnt charcoal ash on it. It's also preferable, or cornmeal if you have any, both are very effective. Then treat it from above with a sieve of boiled egg yolk soaked in rose water, beaten with fragrant rose oil. Leave it on until another day then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
This is a description of how this scalpel is suitable for purification:.
To be a completely flat and undented scalpel, with the needle holder in place. The length of the blades should match the length of the handles equally. As for the mistake made during purification, it might have cut all or some of the inner skin when cutting. It is preferable to extend the area by using your thumb nail before the affected site swells.
And cut it evenly, if you can't hold it with your nail, use a scraper and cut it. If it has lasted for three days and the part under the nose swells, throw it away until the hot tumor subsides and remove it gently.
And cut it according to what is suitable for you, and preserve the nose tip. If you cut a part of the nose tip, it does not harm that, treat it with whatever seals wounds as described in our article on "Sealing Materials".
And if you cut more skin than necessary and it retracts above, that also doesn't harm much. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The fifty-eighth section.
In treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage caused by a stone, dried blood, mucus, or fatty tissue, etc. Once this issue is addressed as we have outlined it, apply the various treatments described in that section.
If urine does not start to pass and I've observed that retention due to a stone has affected the neck of the bladder, it might be necessary for him to lie on his elbows with his back straight up. Then one person should ride on top of him while extending his belly towards his back, holding onto him as much as possible.
When then, the neck of the bladder is forced to push out the stone behind, urine will be expelled. If it does not expel as stated and if the situation becomes more difficult for the patient, it might be necessary to use an instrument called catheters, which here is illustrated:
It is made of silver, it's fine and smooth with a hollow shape like a feather pipe in a flute length about a span and half. It has a gentle dome at its head end. There is an attraction mechanism for urine by taking a double-thick thread and tying silk or cotton tightly to its end.
The end of the thread enters at the bottom of the catheter and is supported with a support. If needed, part of the cotton might enter in the pipe to block it like a plug, then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white. The patient sits on a chair.
Her double and the winding rod are lubricated with moist hands, oil or water vapor. The catheter is then gently inserted into the winding until it reaches the root of it. Then the winding is bent upwards towards the pubis, followed by pushing the catheter inside.
Until if the winding is bent then pushing the catheters inside until it's close to the prostate, the male body inclines downwards and the catheters are inside him. Then push until it reaches the bladder making the patient feel that something empty has been reached.
It is made at this level because the urethra, where urine travels, has twists. The thread with cotton is pulled slightly, making the urine follow the cotton. After that, she removes it and flushes the urine, then repeats the catheterization.
Even until the bladder is emptied and he feels relief.
The fortieth chapter.
How to inject the bladder with the reed pipe.
Illustrations of the devices suitable for this, made from silver or from wrought copper, having a long pipe on a bison bone. You want to drain water and medicines through it, making an instrument known as the reed pipe. Here is its depiction:.
They are made of silver or from wrought copper, having a long pipe on a bison bone. It is all hollowed out except for the end which is pointed. There are two holes on one side and one on the other as you can see.
And the hollow part where the gunpowder is placed, it should be filled to a point that it will not exceed. So when you draw some moisture with it, it will suck and when you push it, it will go out as far as needed, like the wick used for pouring oil in naval warfare.
And if you want to pour the moisture into the bladder, you put the end of the reed pipe in the moisture and pull with the gunpowder upwards. The moisture will be drawn into the hollow part of the reed pipe, then it enters through its end into the stomach as we described in the catheters. Then you discharge the moisture with the gunpowder.
And that moisture reaches the bladder at its place until it is felt by the patient, and here is an illustration of a gentle catheter also for using it to flush the bladder:.
They are made of silver or horsehair, with its top resembling a small muzzle and below it is a bag that contains the band. Then you take a goat's bladder and put in there the moisture you want to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two partitions with a double thread.
This excerpt instructs on how to insert a catheter. It says, "That moisture is slightly heated over the fire then, one end of the catheter is inserted into the urethra. Then you pull your hand with force on the bladder through the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If the bladder is not available, take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it. Pierce it through all its parts, then insert a thin thread in that hole as you would rotate it. Then gather the circle like a pot after placing whatever you want of moisture, oils, water, etc., inside.
Then tie it in the device and make it as you made with the bladder, squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the extraction of gravel stones.
We mentioned in the section the types of gravel stones and their treatment with medicines, we highlighted the differences between the gravel stone formed in the kidney and the one formed in the bladder and the signs of all this, also we mentioned the gravel stone where the work is done manually and the split.
And it is the gravel stone formed specifically in the bladder, which develops in the urethra, and I am describing this with a clear explanation and condensation.
I say that the gravel stone formed in the bladder is more prone to occur in boys, and one of its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its consistency.
Rocks appear in it, and it refers to it, plays with it, and often hangs down then spreads, causing the urethra to protrude in many of them. It makes masturbation easier for boys until they reach fourteen years old, and it becomes harder in the elderly. As for adolescents, they are somewhere between these two scenarios.
The one whose stone is larger, his treatment will be easier and the smaller opposes this. If we go to the treatment, it should first be that the pus is injected with an injection that removes all the pus inside him because he may prevent the presence of the stone upon examination.
Then, the pus is taken with his legs being lifted and shaken downwards to make the stone descend into the urethra or it might be made to move from a higher position several times. Then, he is seated between your hands standing upright, his arms under his knees so that all the bladder becomes inclined downwards. Then, you inspect him.
Then, examine him externally. If you feel the stone in the air space, act promptly by making a cut on it during your session. Should it not fall under pressure alone, it may be advisable to smear the index finger (or the middle finger if he is an adult) of the left hand with oil after having lifted the pus.
If he is a full-grown boy, you insert your finger in his anus and search for the stone until it falls under your finger. Then, move it slightly into the urethra step by step. Press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you want to make an incision.
And you command a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and command another servant that he extends his right hand to the women upwards, and with his other hand he extends the skin under the women towards the place where the cut should be. Then, take the sheath of circumcision which this is its form:.
And you make a cut between the anus and the women, not in the middle but towards the left side. The incision should be made on top of the stone and your finger is inside the anus while pressing it outwards with a tool that makes the cut from outside wide and from inside narrow according to what can allow the stone to come out.
Do not press the finger on the kidney stone holder in the fissure, perhaps it might come out without difficulty. Be aware that there may be aspects and angles of the stone making its removal difficult for this reason.
Some of them are smooth like beech wood and have a rolling shape which makes their removal easy. If they have corners and edges, it can make the fissure slightly larger. If they do not come out this way, it is advisable to change strategy by gripping them with a tight tool akin to a plier at its tip similar to that of an iron tool.
To stabilize the stone so it does not escape from him, or else introduce a slightly curved and polished tool under it. If you can't manage it this way, widen the fissure slightly. If there is blood in abundance, cut it with a scalpel.
If there are more than one, first push the largest into the bladder's mouth then cut it. After that, you can push the smaller ones in. Follow this procedure if there are more than two stones. If they are exceptionally large, it is foolish to cut a huge incision for them as it leaves two possible complications.
Either he dies or it will result in constant urinary tract infection because the affected area won't heal properly. Try pushing them out until they come out, or break them using forceps to remove them piece by piece.
When you're done, cleanse the wound with a cloth and apply rest, oil, or a cold compress. This helps cool down the heat from the operation. Let him lie on his side without any bandages until the third day.
Once the inflammation subsides, cleanse the area with a lot of water and oil. Then treat it with naphtha ointment and basil ointment until recovery is achieved. If infection or heat remains in the wound along with swelling and pus-like substances, this indicates that blood has frozen in the bladder and urine is being prevented from passing through, which can be identified by spotting blood when urinating.
Enter your finger into the wound and remove that blood. If it remains, it calls for bladder corruption and its putrefaction. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply to each type of injury what corresponds to its treatment until it heals.
During all periods of treatment, it is necessary to hold the thighs together and unite them so as to ensure that the medicines placed on the area are effective. If there is a small stone inside the urethra causing irritation and preventing urination, treat it with what I described previously before it causes a rupture.
Often, I have been able to avoid the surgery with this treatment. Let me try it; you will see its form:".
A sharp triangular point poked into a reed, then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it doesn't return to the bladder. Then insert the end of the reed into the urethra gently until the reed reaches the same stone.
And guide the reed in your hand slightly on the stone, going back and forth until you puncture it through to the other side. Urine starts to come out from its hole. Then, keep your hand on what is left of the stone outside the penis. It breaks apart and comes out with urine; this will heal the injured area.
If this treatment is not available and there's an obstacle preventing you, tie a thread below the stone and another one above it. Then cut into the stone right in the penis between these two threads, then remove it.
Then remove the band and clean the coagulated blood in the wound. It was necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it doesn't return to the bladder, while the other thread above is for when after removing the stone, the skin returns to its place covering the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin above so that it returns upon your release and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter Sixty.
In the removal of stones in women.
Very little stones are born in women. If one of them has a stone, it makes her treatment difficult and prevents many reasons. One reason might be that the woman could be a virgin, and the second is that you would not find a woman who would allow herself to be treated by a doctor.
If she is a virgin or from those under guardianship, the third reason being that you would not find a woman who would approve of this craft, especially hands-on work. The fourth reason is that the place where the incision on the stone in women occurs is far from the location of the stone itself; hence it requires a subsequent incision.
In that case, there is a risk. If necessity compels this, it should be taken by an experienced female doctor; very few exist. If she doesn't, seek out a virgin and friendly doctor or have someone who has expertise in matters concerning women or bring a woman capable of some indication in this craft.
You should prepare her and command her to perform all that you order her in inspecting the stone first. This involves looking to see if the woman is a virgin. It would be advisable for her to enter her finger into her seat and inspect the stone; if she finds it, she can press it under her finger.
So when then, you command her for the incision. If she is not a virgin and she's a woman who has been married before, the available woman should enter her finger into the recess of the wet nurse and inspect the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it tightly.
If found, it should be indicated going from the mouth of the bladder down to the full extent of its capacity until it reaches the root of the thigh, then make a cut upon her in proximity to half the urethra at the root of the thigh from whichever side she might encounter it and feels the stone in that area.
And her finger does not leave the stone, pressing it down, and let the incision be small first then insert the forceps into this small cut. If she feels the stone, she increases the incision according to how much she realizes that the stone can come out from it, and know that types of stones are numerous.
And there are small and large ones, smooth and rough, long and twisted, branched, and you should know their types to guide yourself according to what you want. If the blood predominates, soak in the swollen place with blood for a moment until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Work and remember with yourself the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men that you can use in your work. If the bleeding predominates, and you know by the pulse of the blood that it comes from a ruptured vessel, place the tongs on the spot.
Pull it with the forceps firmly and leave it without repeating it. Do not remove the stone, as removing it might cause the patient's death, then treat the wound, wait for several days until the bleeding subsides, let the area heal, and return to your work until the stone is removed.
The second chapter and sixty.
In the incision on the waterways.
The waterways are moisture accumulations in the white stratum beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testicle, known as the scaphoid and may be within a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the egg.
Until he thinks it's another egg, and finds itself between the scrotum skin and the white cover (eyeball) which we mentioned, and this is only in rarity. These instances are produced from weakness that affects females leading to this material being exposed onto female anatomy.
This moisture can have various colors, either yellow, or reddish blood-colored, or dark and black, or water-white, the latter being more common. The signs by which it is recognized.
When water accumulates, if it is in the white cover (eyeball) as we described, the tumor becomes somewhat elongated along its length like an egg shape and the testicles do not show because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is within the scrotal sac, then the tumor becomes elongated in one direction of the egg.
For this reason, humans may think it's another egg. If the moisture is between the scrotum skin and the white cover (eyeball), he feels it through touch. And if you want to know the color of the moisture, put a square sponge on the tumor that I previously described, whatever comes out from the sponge determines its content.
If we proceed with iron treatment, you should order the patient to fast if it is possible for him and see his body filled up. Then he should lie on something slightly high on his back. Place many holes underneath him then sit on his left side.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right side, extending the testicles towards one of my sides and towards the abdominal wall. Then take a broad blade, and cut through the scrotal skin from the center lengthwise almost reaching the inner fold.
The incision should be made straight along the line that divides the scrotal skin in half, extending until it reaches the white bag containing the testicles. Then you should cut into the bag and take care not to cut through it. Your incision should be on the side that sticks to the testicle if possible, and your excision should be as thorough as you can manage.
Then you fill the inflated epididymis with water gently and widely, then all the water is drained out. After that, you separate the incision lips by prongs and stretch the epididymis upwards without touching the scrotal skin containing it. You cut the epididymis however you can manage to, either in one piece or in pieces.
Especially its thinner side, you should thoroughly examine each piece. If you fail to do so, water might reappear. Should the testicle be pushed out of its skin while you are working, and upon draining the epididymis, then once done with cutting the epididymis, smooth it out again, and then stitch together the scrotal skin edges.
Then treat it with the treatment of all surgeries until it heals. If the testicle has been affected by a previous illness, it might be necessary to tie the blood vessels in the epididymis to prevent bleeding. Then cut off the penis from the scrotum and remove the testicle. Afterwards, treat it according to what we have mentioned.
If the water is present in both sides equally, know that these are two testicles. Make an incision on the other side as you did with the first one, regardless of whether it suits you to have a single operation or not. Then wipe off the blood.
You insert cotton that has been soaked in oil or rose butter into the incisions. From outside, you place another piece of cotton that has been soaked in wine and oil on it, spread them over both testicles and the abdominal lining. You put it above a folded sheet which is called the mattress. And it is joined from above with the band which has six branches as seen in this picture:
And then two strips are taken, which are combed and filled with the fluffed wool as shown in this example. The ends which it is attached with from cotton or wet wool are made, and they are fastened together by tying them into a belt of the trousers. One end takes hold on the seat to the back.
And the second one is taken towards the elbow, and the two ends are on the thighs from below, while the remaining two ends are on the buttocks. All of this tying is gathered into a belt of trousers. This can also be made with leather instead of cutting with iron.
And this is to take a soft, single-bladed iron awl and cut the scrotal skin with it until the white pouch containing water opens. Then, take another awl as seen in this picture:
And it resembles the Greek eye, then press that pouch with it until all moisture comes out. Then stretch the pouch and sew it, then cut out the membrane containing it as much as you can without touching the egg, while keeping everything else intact to prevent any harm from fire.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than the cutting method. If you encounter resistance in the cut or while sewing, a hot object or blood leakage or any other thing, it should be treated whenever such an obstacle comes up according to what has been provided.
And if the patient is weak and cannot bear this operation due to its harshness, then using cautery according to what I am describing should be used instead. And it should be applied whenever it matches your observations based on our previous evidence.
The vesicles are aqueous. It is necessary for the patient to sit on a high stool, then press the tumor from below with a broad clamp and have the edge of the clamp along the body's length, making the opening wide enough for all water to flow out. Then place cotton on the spot and bind it.
And leave him until all the rest of the water has drained out, then treat it until the wound heals. If water continues to drain while he's being treated by suction, this is due to the fact that the white membrane is blocking at the mouth of the wound and preventing the water from draining out.
And at that point, it may be necessary to enter the wound with an ostrich feather or the device used to remove lovers' water, which has advanced its picture, or increase the opening in the wound slightly.
And remember that water may return and gather after about six months or so. If it gathers, suction him in the same manner and allow the patient his days.
Chapter thirty-six.
In the incision on fatty flesh and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this fatty tissue often leads to destruction, therefore we see leaving it and safeguarding it. I am mindful of the work involved in it and types of tumor.
I say that many tumors may occur in the bodies made up of female components, and this is due to various reasons, either from heat or a blow. The color of the tumor matches the body's color and it does not have water.
The tumor is hard, and perhaps it's hardened with color like mud; it has no feeling. It might be due to the complications of veins and their dilation or from dilation of the vessels. If it's due to dilation of the veins, then this can be identified by the disappearance of the tumor.
If it gets burned by your fingers and does not turn black, but if there is swelling of the veins, then nothing disappears from it upon squeezing with the fingers. This type can be cut through along with other tissues.
And that is to cut the scrotal skin, then guide the testicle upwards and remove it from the white wound. Clean the appendix of blood vessels, tie the blood vessels, and after cleaning them from all sides of the testicle, if the testicle has adhered to such growing tissues.
You should remove and cut the testicle, if there is adhesion between something of the wounds or among the blood vessels. In this case, it's necessary to carefully remove all such adhesions and cut them in a straight line.
If the tissue is growing in a location where adhesion occurs behind, it should be cut completely and the testicle removed as we've described. Once your work is done, cleanse the wound with wet wool dipped in oil and wine, then treat it with other medications until it heals.
Chapter forty-six.
In treating the testicles when there is inflammation.
The dala'alah is a tumor that has tangled, resembling a knot, akin to ovarian cysts but causing difficulty in movement, sports, and walking for the patient. In treating this condition among gynecological issues, it's similar to what was previously discussed.
But we should mention the process with what was initially done. I would say that it is necessary for the patient to sit on a high stool, then push the woman's appendix downwards. Afterward, grasp the scrotal skin with your fingers while keeping the blood vessels close to the penis.
The servant holds your limb and extends it to an extreme length. Then, using a broad sharp blade, they cut deeply into the crease until they expose the veins like a furrow made by the soles of feet over the vessels. Afterward, they slit from each side as you were taught about severing the arteries in the arms then insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
And attach it in the first place where the lymph duct exposed her, and also at the last. Then cut it in the middle with a cut standing along the body length, and remove what gathered there from the bad accumulated fluids.
Then treat the womb with any other surgical treatments you want for a duration until it falls off, which supplies one of the female's organs. There is nothing wrong with that as long as if the lymph duct exposes all the vessels, then at least one of the females should come out along with the vessels so as not to deprive the egg of its food. By cutting off the arteries, it deflates and no longer benefits.
The fifty-fourth chapter.
In treating inflammatory diarrhea.
The occurrence of this diarrhea results from a cut that appears in the extended chest cavity towards the ovaries, causing the intestinal contents to flow through that swelling into one of the females.
This hernia can either be from a tear in the chest cavity or an extension of it. Both types are among many causes, such as being hit, getting scratched, giving birth, lifting something heavy, etc. Its sign is that if it results from an extension of the chest cavity, then it will occur slightly and gradually over a long time.
It doesn't occur suddenly; instead, the tumor rises about halfway from where the chest cavity presses on the intestine. Its sign is that if it results from a tear in the chest cavity, then it causes a severe pain with each burst and makes the lump noticeable under the skin near the start.
That is, the removal of the internal matter and its direction towards outside through the scrotum. The disease may come out along with the internal matter; this kind of discharge is called pusy and stony due to the accompanying inflammation. It can also occur together with wind, or it might cause blockage of feces within the intestine leading to malabsorption.
Because it causes severe pain and grating, especially when squeezed. The treatment for such cases can be dangerous due to iron use, so caution should be advised against falling into this trap. The remedy involves commanding the patient to push back any returning internal matter with their hand if it tries to return inside their body.
Then, he lies between your hands with his legs raised. Stretch the skin above the scrotum and cut the entire scrotal skin lengthwise. Then insert needles into the incision on both sides according to the need for widening it.
The incision should be as long as it can allow the egg to pass through. Then, peel away the pouches under the scrotal skin until you can see the firm white membrane on both sides from inside. At this point, insert your pinky finger below the egg.
In the space between the white scrotal membrane underneath the testicle skin and the second scrotum, you will release any adhesion behind the testicles. Then, bend your right hand into the scrotal skin, while simultaneously stretching the white scrotal membrane with your left hand. Lift the testicle along with the scrotum towards the incision area.
You command the servant to lift the egg upwards, and you completely release any adhesion behind it. You use your finger to search thoroughly so there is nothing left of the enclosed internal matter in the firm white scrotum; if you find something, push it back into the abdomen downwards.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, which is thinned by ten threads, and insert it at the end of the incision located under the skin behind the testicles. Then cut both ends of the bent thread so that there will be four threads. Then she combines some of them, intertwining them tightly together. She ties this incision that we mentioned, being below the testicles' skin, with a tight band from both sides. Then she also wraps the ends of the threads and ties them firmly so that nothing can reach any of the vessels nourishing it. So that no heat is exposed from that tumor, and it also forms a second band outside the first one by less than an inch. After these two bands, she leaves enough of this incision under the skin behind the testicles according to the size of the finger.
So that no heat is exposed from that tumor, and it also forms a second band outside the first one by less than an inch. After these two bands, she leaves enough of this incision under the skin behind the testicles according to the size of the finger. Then she cuts the rest all around and removes the testicle with it. Then, she makes a cut under the skin behind the testicles that allows blood to flow out as described earlier. Afterwards, she uses the oiled wool which was mentioned before and places it in the wound. She then uses the bandage we have described.
And the white incision, which we have said is cut carefully to prevent excessive blood loss. This happens often and leaves it vulnerable. The bandage should be left until it falls off on its own; if it doesn't fall off promptly, soak it in hot water and apply more heat to it until it does.
Then treat the wound with all other treatments for wounds until it heals,
Chapter Sixty and Forty.
In this condition, the windpipe I have not seen anyone attempt to treat it with iron. The initial steps are as follows: To carefully tie up the vessels above the incision below.
Then cut through the center and treat the tumor by what opens it until the vessels fall out, then treat the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
The seventy-first chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the abdomen.
Hernia in the abdomen, as we have mentioned, may present at its place without descending into the females a part of the intestine, and if it does descend, this is a matter that occurs easily and returns always.
However, if time prolongs this condition, the incision in the navel increases until it causes the intestine and the anus to descend into the pelvis. This phenomenon is a result of extending the navel which we mentioned occurs with hernia in the abdomen. That is because the navel extends, then relaxes and pushes back to its place causing it to descend, and its treatment would be as I previously described.
It can also be treated using iron in this way: the patient lies on their back between your hands, then you make an incision at the warm area of the hernia longitudinally to a length of three fingers. After that, you flatten out the ligaments underneath the skin.
Until if the white cord behind it opens, you take a thread and place it on the resulting position of the ligament then push it deep into the abdomen. Then, you sew the resulting positions at both ends of the thread from the ligament and stitch them together.
Then pull the end of the thread, do not cut the ligament entirely or touch the testicles as I taught you in treating intestinal obstructions. Then treat it with surgical wound care.
If the threads have stopped, cleanse the wound and let it heal until it disappears. The hernia ligament will tighten without increasing in descent.
The cat is better in this position because it is closer to safety.
Chapter eighty-six.
In the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
Often, the scrotal skin relaxes in some people without relaxing the muscles inside it, making its appearance unattractive. Those who wish to treat it should lie on their back.
And cut all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then bring the lips together. If you wish, you can stitch first, sewing the relaxed skin with three or four stitches and checking the stitching before cutting between the stitches.
And then treat it with other surgical remedies until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter ninety-six.
In circumcision.
Circumcision is prohibited in our religion.
And that is why I should not mention it in my book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: the first being that it would be useful for a doctor if someone asked him about it and they know how to treat those affected by it; the second reason is that we often need circumcision of some animals for our benefit.
Circumcision is done in two ways, either by drawing blood or by cutting and severing. When it's done by bleeding, the method involves placing the animal in hot water until her udders relax, soften, and hang down.
Then you squeeze it with your hand until it dissolves and is not distinguishable upon touch. As for circumcision by cutting and severing, you should grasp the animal and squeeze its scrotum with your left hand, then tie the weights and make one cut across each testicle.
Even if the two testicles emerge, cut them after stripping them and do not leave anything on them except for the fine scrotal skin that is on the vessels. This kind of excision is better than leaving them as they are.
Because if any of the females remain, it might please the animal for copulation, then treat the wound until it heals.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
In treating feminization surgery.
Feminization in men is of two types; one where it appears in the space or between the female genitals, shaped like a woman's vagina with hair, and urine may leak from this man who has it in his scrotal skin.
And in women, there is one type which is above the vagina on the thigh like a little penis from both of them as if it was a man's penis, and two others resemble females, treating all three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women should have that excess flesh cut off until its effects disappear, then treat them with treatments for other surgeries until they heal. As for the second type of male who urinates from his scrotal skin, it has no function and no harm.
The eighty-seventh chapter.
In removing the testicles and tissue from female vaginas.
The testicles might grow beyond the normal amount, becoming hardened and disfiguring their appearance. They could also increase in some women to spread like men, leading to copulation.
It should be cut off by holding the testicle in your hand or with forceps and cutting it, without being overly careful about the cut nor particularly deep at the base to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then he treats it with surgical remedies until healing occurs, and the新生 flesh grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And perhaps it might protrude outside like the case of a tail. And that is why some of the early physicians call this disease "the tail illness". It should be cut like the testicle, whether it is inside or outside, and then treated until healing occurs.
The second section and the seventieth chapter.
In treating humpback.
A humpback is when a woman's vulva is not entirely penetrated or the opening is small. It can either be naturally present since birth, or it can be acquired due to some reason that has progressed, and in this latter case, it could be due to excess flesh growing.
Or it could be thin or thick, and it can either be deep within the womb, or on its sides, above or below. It prevents intercourse, menstruation, childbirth, and possibly urination. Knowing this comes from observing the gynecologist.
If the obstruction is visible nearby, if it's not then examine it with your fingers or a speculum. If it's from thin tissue and near the lips of the vagina, start to puncture it. This means place on the lips of the vagina something resembling a catheter tip, then put all your fingers together of both hands.
The woman is on her back, her legs are spread out. Then she pushes the lips forcefully until she punctures the thin tissue and the obstruction opens up. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it at the spot. The woman should have intercourse every day so that the spot doesn't heal again.
If the stricture is thick and dense, it may be necessary to cut through it with a broad scalpel resembling an asp's skin. If the blockage is caused by fresh tissue, sew it with thread and cut it off, and have medications ready for clot control that are not too painful such as kaqya, shian, milk mixed with egg white.
Then, you use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly. Secure it for several days and then use dry cotton wool. Continue with all treatments for adhesion until healed. There may be another type of meat plant in the womb, which might require this kind of cutting treatment.
If it is not a cancerous tumor, then a cancerous tumor in the womb should not be treated with iron alone.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, fistulas, and red warts that appear on women's thighs.
As for hemorrhoids, it is swelling of the veins until blood flows out in large quantities continuously. If hemorrhoids occur, they turn into fistulas. I have mentioned their types and symptoms under the division; we will now discuss them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated. I would say that hemorrhoids and fistulas, if they are deep within the womb and not perceptible by touch, do not have a treatment with iron. The one that is affected by touch, which occurs at the mouth of the womb, is the one that should be treated.
It may be necessary for the woman to enter a cold room, then extend the fistulas with a rag or coarse needle and cut them from their roots. Then she should leave it when bleeding occurs from one of the closed blood vessels without cauterization.
Like cutting the testicles, ovaries, and milk gland and similar parts. Then lift her legs to the wall for an hour, then let them hang in cold water. If there is still bleeding, sit her in a mixture of snail secretion, almond peels, and clove, and similar items. Take the flour of wheat, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Support her with it on her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise bind the grafted bone and the nipples without any condition. Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of thornapple, or the tongue's juice from a pregnant animal, or the juice of branches of alligator weed mixed with clove wine, then bind the position.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pus, it resembles the heads of hyssop, it looks coarse. It would be best to cut what has appeared from it as mentioned in the compilations, then treat it until it heals.
The forty-seventh chapter.
In the womb, when it displays in the uterus.
Various types of tumors may appear in the womb, such as cancer, calcified tumors, ulcers, pus-filled lesions, eating tumors, hernias, hemorrhoids, fissures, and compilations. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in this section.
We should mention in this article the feverous tumor that may appear in the womb among tumors that have been present for a long time. The hardness of its surface might be like iron, you should observe if the pain it causes at the beginning is sharp accompanied by twinges, inflammation and fever.
And I saw it red, if you feel sensation on it, do not hurry with its treatment and treat it with what promotes maturity until these symptoms subside. Then when this happens, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean against her back.
She brings her legs to the lower abdomen area, making her thighs spread out and her arms under her knees, then ties them with a belt that fits.
So, the gynecologist sits on the right side and uses the instrument that she will open the womb's mouth with, which appears later in the picture. If you want to use this instrument, you should estimate the depth of the woman's womb so that what enters through the machine is not deeper than the womb.
If the apparatus is deeper than the womb, it should be that tubes are placed on the cervix's lips to prevent the whole apparatus from entering the womb too deeply. The coil running in the apparatus should be from the top side.
You hold the instrument while the servant guides the coil until it opens the cervix. If the discharges appear and you can touch them with your hand, feeling a thin fluid, it should be that you cut him across his head using a wide pair of scissors until all the time has passed.
It should be that there is a soft wick immersed in rose oil or green oil containing some grip. The wick should extend out of the cut from the cervix, and it should have pure wool wrapped in boiling water on the womb and on the thigh from the outside.
Then, it is treated with the ointment suitable for that purpose until it heals.
The womb and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water that has boiled with ambergris or a long wormwood root. Then return to the ointment; if the discharge is hidden inside the womb.
It should be avoided treating it with iron, rather it should be treated as mentioned in this section.
The Seventy-Fourth Section.
In teaching how to treat living horns that have come out in an unnatural shape.
The midwife should first know the natural birth. It is a characteristic of this that when she sees a woman get pregnant, she lowers herself and craves to breathe fresh air; and what she experiences during delivery makes her feel relieved.
The baby comes out quickly, know that this birth is in the natural shape. It exits with its head and placenta together or hanging from its back. If you see these signs, it would be advisable to compress her abdomen so that the baby can come out quickly.
If it descends onto his head, the placenta comes with him and cleanses from that moisture properly. Apart from this birth, it is unnatural and reprehensible, as he may give birth to the baby on its feet with its hands coming out before its head and feet.
One of its hands or a leg may come out, or it might give birth to the head and hand or have them folded, perhaps even turning on its forehead, like many other reprehensible forms. The midwife should be cautious about all these matters and avoid errors and mishaps.
And I clarify all of its forms and how to deal with each one so that you can apply this knowledge, should a baby come out on its head which is the natural birth. The woman becomes strained by it and finds it difficult to push; I notice her strength has weakened. I ask for chairs to be brought in for her to sit on and instruct the women on how to assist her correctly.
She extends her womb with cooked liver and moist ointment, then the midwife pushes in between her fingers a small implement to separate or cut off the placenta using its edge. She cuts away any moisture from within it until she can release the baby by compressing the woman's abdomen.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with saliva of the tongue along with ointment for the rectum. Then command her after the injection to exfoliate and clean herself using soap, keep her mouth closed, and her nose covered. If the fetus comes out from its place, then if the first hand of the fetus comes out, it should be gently pushed back a little at a time.
If she does not enter, put the woman on a stool and lift her legs above. Then shake the stool on the ground, and the woman should hold on so that she doesn't fall when it shakes. If the hands do not enter and if the fetus dies, cut off both hands and draw out the remaining part of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a reed and draw them evenly; he comes out, the birth of the fetus on its legs. If the fetus comes out on its legs, it should be pushed upwards, then slowly turn the fetus until it is straightened. Then take one of its legs and extend it slowly.
If they have gone to the thighs, command her to exfoliate and clean herself using soap; he comes out, if it does not come out as described and otherwise, gently turn the fetus until it becomes natural; then he comes out smoothly when it is turned in that way. If none of what was described is effective completely.
Take saliva from the sperm whale, saliva of the tongue, ointment for the rectum and dissolved gallstones; strike all on the ladle well. Then pour it over the woman's vagina and lower abdomen. Then have her sit in hot water until the effects are felt.
If you notice that it cannot be underneath her, make her a mattress of reed and she should carry it. If she holds the mattress for an hour, have her sit on the chair then clean her and cover her mouth and nose. Squeeze gently under her abdomen; if the fetus comes out from its place, it will come out with its knees and hands.
If this condition appears, let her limbs be slightly raised by his hands, then the woman lies on her back and lowers her buttocks downwards while she is lying on a bed holding her hands together, then gently squeeze above her abdomen. Then remove what is under her feet with the cushions until they are tilted downwards. If the baby does not come out, take both of her legs and move them violently. Then gently squeeze above her thighs until the baby ascends to the top. Then the midwife will enter her hands and slightly adjust the position of the baby.
And instruct the woman to squat until the baby is born. The birth of the baby is obstructed and held by one of her hands, hold back his hand. If she cannot hold it back herself, make the woman stand and keep her walking. If she cannot walk, have her lie down again.
And have her lie on the bed, vigorously shake her legs. Then use the suction device described with saliva if it takes effect, then seat her on a chair. Proceed to hold and adjust the birth position of the baby naturally, instructing her to squat until it is born.
The baby should come out with its head flat, its hands extended and its face towards the back of its mother. The midwife should then hold onto the baby's hand and gently turn it slightly and adjust it carefully. Once adjusted properly, she should carry it on her shoulder as described earlier using the grease and saliva we've outlined.
Then make her move slightly. If she does this, seat her on the chair and instruct her to tilt towards the right side. Then have her squat and blow raspberries with a fan. It should be evident that the baby is being born, coming out upright on one side.
If it falls into the woman's womb in this state with the mucus, cut the mucus with your nail until all moisture drains out. If it is attached to the baby's face or neck, cut it from its source so that it does not strangle and die. Then push the baby inside until it becomes as it should.
And order the woman to fast several times, for it will give birth easily, as with twins or many fetuses. Know that often multiple births occur and children may be born as three or four of them survive only; however, this is rare. As for five babies, they are outside nature's norms and do not really live.
And surround them, and if they increase, there is one mucus sac that separates them with a barrier in each of their sources. They might come out as the single fetus would naturally and smoothly, or they might emerge in an unfortunate manner as we described.
If some of them have difficulty at birth and turn to the shapes we described that are not natural, act as we described, let the woman be gentle and do what she does with care and skill. She must adapt herself to each shape according to the trick or plan that is suitable for her, leading to safety.
Describe what is imagined in the womb of fetuses, they may fall out. It might be imagined that there is one or two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten inside the womb. I have heard that a woman gave birth to seven, another to fifteen; all were imagined like this.
Considering the respected knowledge, all of this should be in a gynecologist's expertise. It might happen to her someday and she should face it properly.
The Sixty-seventh Chapter.
In delivering the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with what was mentioned in this section of treatment, and it did not produce results, forcing you to act manually. You should check if the woman is physically strong and free from any symptoms that might cause damage. If the woman is physically healthy, you should lie her down on a bed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised. A slave should adjust it from both sides or tie it to the bed so that when the fetus is being pulled out, her body will not get caught.
Then, he moistens her womb with wet cloths and saliva of the donkey's tongue and the snail. Then she applies these substances on her hands and the saliva. She enters them gently into the womb. She then seeks a place for the tools to pierce the fetus. The spots corresponding to this are sought as well.
Check if the fetus is descending onto its head; then, you should pierce it through its eyes or its forehead, or its mouth, or through its neck, under its beard, or at its growing areas, or near the ribs, or beneath the armpits.
If the fetus descends onto its legs, then it should be in the elbow area and middle back. It's necessary to hold the tool with the right hand and place your thumb between your left fingers. Proceed gently with the insertion of the tool into some of those places that we've mentioned.
Until she reaches a hollow part, then insert another tool or a third one if needed to ensure an equal pull and not bias it in any direction. Then extend for as long as necessary; the extension should not just be straight but also move in all directions.
It is not easy to remove like the tooth when it's being extracted and there should be relaxation between this procedure. If it is held by one side, it might be beneficial that some fingers are rubbed with grease and introduced from that side for rotation of what is held. If part of the fetus comes out, move the forceps to another position.
You should lift this slightly until the fetus comes out completely, if only one hand protrudes and can't be pulled back due to being pressed by another part, it might be necessary to loop a tie around it then pull it until all of it has come out, and then cut it.
Otherwise in the elbow joint or in the shoulder girdle, like this you should do in the other hand and both legs, if the fetus' head is large and wide causing pressure during its exit or if there's collected water on its head, it might be necessary to insert a curved hook between the fingers.
And use it to cut through the head so that the water comes out or use a device called the "shadakh" which is shown with other machines in the next section following this.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, you should cut or puncture the skull with the shadakh as we said. Then remove the bones with the clamps. If the head is protruding and is pressed during effort, cut it to allow drainage of the fluid in the chest.
If the chest joins then, if the chest does not join and there is no way for it to come out, cut as much as you can. If it's in the lower abdomen and it's heavy or has a lump, it might be necessary to flatten it until the fluid flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it will be easy and settling it into the womb's mouth here. If it is pressed near the abdomen or chest, you should pull it with a hook wrapped around your hand and cut the abdomen or chest until the contents flow from them.
If you have extracted all the organs and the head returns, it gets stuck. Therefore, if you can reach it with your left hand, enter it when the womb's mouth is open; put your hand in the neck of the womb, take hold of the head, and pull it using your fingers into the womb's mouth. Then, enter a forceps or two forceps and pull it with them.
If the womb's mouth has fused with a hot tumor spanning across it, it should not be subjected to force. In that case, it is advisable to use wet, oily things and the cloths (of the gynecological instrument) are used. It sits in water which relaxes and moisturizes.
And if the fetus is on its side and it can be flattened, then use what we mentioned in the case of a living fetus. If this isn't possible, cut it off and remove it, ensuring that nothing remains of the placenta inside completely. Once you have completed your treatment, apply the remedy we mentioned for treating tumors that are hot and exposed within the womb.
If there is a gush of blood, you should dip in the pooled water and use other remedies. I have seen a woman who had miscarried but her fetus died inside her womb; she then miscarried again.
Then, the other fetus also died. It took a long time for this to occur; there was a tumor in her abdomen that swelled until it burst and started releasing pus. I was called upon to treat her and treated her for a long time; however, the wound did not heal properly. So, I applied some strong remedies with suctioning.
Then, a bone came out of the place; then, days passed and another bone came out. I was surprised by this since her abdomen is not a place that contains bones; she must have been having dead fetus bones in her. Upon examining the wound, I found and extracted many bones from the skull bones of the dead fetus.
I continued following this until I extracted a large number of bones from it, and the woman was in her best condition, and she had lived like this for some time. It is what led me to bring this rare case here.
Because in her there is knowledge and assistance for what the doctor tries to do with his treatment.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
There are images of the machines needed for delivering the baby.
A picture of a tool that opens the cervix:.
This apparatus that balances the books whether it has two spindles at both ends of the wood, but this spindle should be softer than the balance and either made of bone or from the wood of boxwood. The width of each piece of wood should be as thick as a finger.
And its ends towards a finger, and their length is about a span and half. In the middle of the sticks are two braces made from the same wood that are fixed in them, so their length is half a span or more slightly. And these braces should be around a finger's width or more slightly.
These two, which enter the cervix and open the spindles when you guide them, is an apparatus another one softer and lighter for this purpose:.
It is made of bone wood or boxwood in the shape of clamps, but it has two braces at its end as you see. The length of each brace is about a span and their width is a finger's width. If you wish to open the cervix with this.
Then, have the woman lie on a padded bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs. Then, insert these two braces into the cervix as far as possible and hold one end of the apparatus at the bottom between her buttocks. Next, open the apparatus like you would clamps to whatever extent you desire for opening the cervix. Until the midwife accomplishes what she desires, an illustration of another instrument mentioned by the pioneers:".
A picture of the gun that pushes the baby:
A picture of the rammer used to drive the baby's head:
It resembles a scissor with teeth at the tip as you see, and it can be made rectangular like this image with teeth like saw teeth that cut and divide:
A picture of a gun also:
A picture of an incision:
This incision has a slight thickness so that it doesn't break when pulling the baby through, picture of an incision with two horns:".
A picture of broad forceps for cutting the baby:
All these instruments, the more types there are and the better prepared they are by the maker, the faster it makes his work and the higher he is esteemed for its capability. There should not be any instrument that you do not have a provision for, because there will always be a need for it.
The eighty-seventh chapter.
In delivering the placenta.
If the placenta becomes stuck after childbirth, you should instruct the midwife to hold herself and then sneeze it out with a floss, gripping her mouth and ears. If it comes out this way, otherwise take some amount.
And make a hole in the cover, place there an opened herbal medicine like fennel, dill, coriander, peppermint, parsley, basil and oregano of all these medicines or some of them, immerse it in water, carry it over fire, then put a silver tube on the hole of the pot lid and the other end into the opening of the womb.
It binds until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then she sneezes as we said before. The placenta will come out quickly. If it remained after this treatment and didn't come out, the physician was instructed to immerse her left hand in camel fat or saliva of a dog.
Then she enters it and searches with her hand for the placenta, if it touches it she grabs it and extends it slightly until it comes out. If it was stuck deep in the womb, enter the hand as described until she finds the placenta, then gently pull it towards the cervix.
So that the womb does not fall due to strong pulling, it should be gently moved to the right and left sides. Then increase the amount of pulling, as she will respond at that time and get rid of the stickiness. If the opening of the womb is closed, then we have described treatment by sneezing and treating with herbs.
If it doesn't come out as described, you should apply force in repeating the pulling process. But you should tie what has come out from her to the woman's thigh, then bathe her with the four-oil mixture; it will cleanse her after a few days.
It dissolves and comes out, except that when she is cleansed, there is a bad smell coming from her to the stomach and head, which harms the pregnant woman. It should be used then the appropriate incense.
Therefore, some early experiments have tried the incense of camphor and dried dates, an image of the machine that evaporates a woman when she is retaining menses and placenta, etc.
It is made of lead that resembles a mask, or it can be made of tin where the delicate tip is placed in the cervix and the wide end on the fire. The incense is made to stick until this incense goes away and then renew it, until it is finished.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In treating the hernia that is not descended.
Many young boys are born with their testicles not descended; they may be stopped by a delicate fold of the skin. It might be able to penetrate this fold with her finger, or else she should use a sharp clamp and beware not to touch the muscle.
Then, cover it with moist wool dipped in water and oil. Treat him with ointments until he heals. If you fear it might close up, put a lead pipe inside the opening for many days, and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
Hernia obstruction may also occur due to wound or tumor, it should be cut through this confluence then treated with the remedies we have mentioned for treatment and scarring.
Chapter Eighty.
In treating the hernias that occur below.
The hernias that occur below are obstructions and tightnesses that happen close to the testicles from outside or in one of the spaces from one side, and the hernia can be one or more.
If this obstruction is removed, it opens and there is a moist wetness with white water or thin pus coming out of it. It might be originating from this hernia to the intestine and then to the stomach, while the non-originating ones can be recognized by what comes out along with their defecation and smell when one performs bowel movement.
It might also come out from parasites, and it could be a hernia if it's originating from the space that reaches to the bladder and the penis passage; or reaching to knee joint and buttock tip. It should also know about those hernias that reach to testicles not originating ones.
To insert your ring finger into the stirrup and to insert a thin needle through the nares, made of copper or iron. If there is no passage in the nares, then if there is one make an insertion with a very fine lead needle or a hair from horse's mane.
Until you feel the needle or the hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing protrudes from the hole, nor smell nor worm as we said, know that it is not inserted properly. Therefore, proceed with treatment.
If the nares is inserted to the bladder or to the urethra, its sign is urine coming out of it and preventing it from being joined by medicines. As for if it is inserted to the knee joint or to the tip of the tailbone, its indication is reaching the needle there.
If there is no passage to the bone and pain is present near this area, along with continuous pus discharge from it, not responding to any treatment nor healing upon removal. All these inserted nares have none of them lead to complete recovery.
Treating it becomes a futile effort for those who resort to unlearned physicians, as for the ones that are not inserted and do not have chronic symptoms, I hope for her complete recovery with iron treatment as I am describing and what I have tried, which is having the patient lie down on their back between your hands.
He raises his legs up and tips his buttocks towards his belly. Then a lead or tin needle should be inserted into the nares if there is a passage, until you understand where the needle ends. If the patient feels it near the stirrup, then it becomes necessary to insert your ring finger into the stirrup.
If you feel that the needle has penetrated through your finger on its own without feeling any obstruction between your finger and the needle, then be sure that it is deeply inserted. Do not bother with it as there will be no relief from it as we said.
And they have said that in some rare cases, and when the treatment hoped for yields benefits, it is to use a fine nail according to the size of the bullet as previously mentioned, and insert it into the bullet until it reaches the seat. Then remove it two or three times.
Until you learn that it has burned all the excess, hardened tissues resembling bird's feather tubes. Then treat it with a wad dipped in fat until those burned tissues come out. Then treat it with salt ointments if it is cured.
Otherwise, it will never be cured by anything else. As for the case where the needle was inserted but did not penetrate into the finger in the seat, there being a thick barrier of flesh or pleura between the needle and the finger, you saw that the bullet lies below the skin surface. Then cut the skin from the first bullet. And you pass through the cut with the needle which is in the bullet until the cut reaches where the end of the needle ends, and then discards the needle which falls off. Then clean those hardened tissues resembling bird's feather tubes from it, leaving nothing behind.
And treat it with salt ointments until it heals. If bleeding overpowers you and hinders your work of cutting out those tissues, the best thing to do is to cauterize or apply a strong medicine to it since cauterizing gathers two good states: burning off those excess tissues.
Cutting off the blood flow and draining moisture, then treating it with impregnated lint in oil or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until pus emerges from the wound. Then treat the injury with ointments made from herbs for hard flesh when this occurs.
And these are the medicines that cause constriction and drainage. If it gets stuck, then it is cured and does not recur. If the navel has sunk deeply into the cavity and passed below the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the cavity and explore with it.
If you feel the obstruction and there is a barrier of cartilage or flesh between you and it, and if it's close to penetration, then all action in this case is only on the path of desire and hope. This means that you should use one of three methods: either sealing it as we described.
Or else cut through it until you reach its bottom, allowing you to insert the lint and treat it closely without prolonging the cut so as not to sever the surrounding muscle, resulting in unintentional defecation. Then treat it with what we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or else remove that barrier and pierce it after cutting through to the cavity as we described, either with a probe or with another sharp-edged device. Then clean out all the accumulated flesh within the cut from where you can explore.
Then remove all the gauze from the wound along with the cut and upper mouth until they close. The navel will remain open inside the cavity, making it easier for defecation, and the navel may become narrower in this form.
And if you insert the probe into the navel and it's in one side of the cavity towards the body surface with skin and the rim of the cavity, then take this moment to use a sharpened-ended probe like an acupuncture needle as depicted here:.
Insert a woven thread of five or about this threads then insert the scalpel with the thread into the fold until it reaches the bottom, if it is sucked in from inside near the base.
Then remove the thread from that hole by putting your finger in the socket and pulling out one end of the thread. Collect both ends together, tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Each time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it tightly until those pieces of flesh between the ends of the threads are cut off and fall down. Then treat the wound until it heals completely.
If the mouth of the fold is not sucked in, force it out as much as you can, but there will be a lot of depth involved, so don't do this for the muscle to avoid cutting it. Then proceed with what we have instructed until it heals.
The scissored forceps that cuts through the folds has a very sharp edge on one side for trimming, while the other side is not as sharp to avoid cutting unnecessary parts as you can see.
The fifty-first chapter and eightieth section.
In the case of hemorrhoids that bleed and their removal, as well as treating fissures.
Hemorrhoids occur in two types, either they are inside the anus resembling blood veins or like raisins from them; there are small and large ones, and blood constantly seeps from them.
They can be single or numerous, and they can be inside or outside the anus. However, those that are outside the anus are less well moisturized; water turns yellowish or has a little blood in it, which constantly flows out of them, and they have the same color as the body.
Treating what is inside the bed, instruct the patient to urinate and defecate until the bed comes out and the stools appear before you. Quickly bind them with reeds or grasp them with your fingers, then cut them at their roots; if the reeds do not stay due to moisture and relaxation.
Pull it with a coarse reed or part of a sharpened stick, or pull it with your fingers. Then cut it and after cutting apply some sharp needles to replace the thread or cut it as described in the section about threads.
Then treat it with all other treatments until recovery occurs. If the patient does not want to evacuate, insert a needle in him containing a bit of cold vinegar for him to wash what is inside the bed and to quickly evacuate when he gets moistened. As for the stools coming out of the bed, you should order them easily.
It is to take it with your finger or bind it and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until recovery occurs. If you dislike cutting with iron, it might be better to use its (iron's) slag in this manner: Take a twisted thread and put it into a needle.
Then draw the stool up and expel it with a needle from its origin on the other side. Wrap both ends of the string below the needle which is blocking, pulling the stool tightly. Then tie the string together and remove the needle. Do this for all the stools, leaving one undisturbed.
To drain it of blood residues, then place on the stool a reed soaked in grease and resin or quill oil, placing it on the stool and ordering the patient to rest. Then leave him until he falls. When the stools fall, treat them with ointments and all other treatments until recovery occurs.
And as for treating constipation, it often happens due to the dryness of the faeces and blocking of the intestinal tract. If it persists without resolving, medication should be prescribed. It might be necessary to incise him with the surgeon's scalpel or your fingernail until it becomes moist and removes the top layer of skin that prevents its adhesion.
And treat him until it heals as needed, if it does not heal, repeat with a stronger incision until it heals properly and scabs. Then treat him, for he will recover.
The Second Chapter, the Eighty.
In treating inverted and non-inverted pins, dry blisters, and bedbug bites.
A pin is nothing but a looped thread of the body color, resembling a pin's head, found throughout the body, particularly in the ankles and toes. It causes pain when walking.
You should incise around the pin, hold it with a file or pliers and remove it from its root. Then treat it, if you wish to strengthen it as described in its section. As for dry blisters, each one of them is a small rough knot that is looped and circular on the body surface.
It often appears in the hands of boys, and its treatment is to stretch out the string and cut it or twist it with silk thread or hair until it falls. You may wish to strengthen it as described previously by fire or medicine.
Dry blisters, both inverted and non-inverted, can be removed using the device I mentioned for treating bedbugs. As for bedbugs themselves, they are also small, sticky knots that go deep into the body surface; if they get cold, one might feel them as if stung by a bedbug.
And it is in the entire body, and more so in the hands; its remedy is to take a tube from an opossum's hair or a strong eagle's feather. The tube should be placed around the ant until it surrounds the circumference of the tube. Then move your hand with the tube until you cut what surrounds the ant.
And make it deep inside the flesh, causing the ant to emerge from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube as shown in this image.
The upper part of the tube reaches the gallbladder; it is curved and flexible to facilitate control and manipulation with fingers. If you wish, place the ant as previously instructed within a loop in a method similar to that found in the section on loops under the heading 'knots'.
The thirty-eighth chapter.
In diagrams of the instruments used for injection in conditions such as stricture, diarrhea, and constipation.
The syringe may be made of silver, porcelain, or brass. It can also be finely drawn or hammered brass. The size of this instrument is made small or large according to the users. The one used for treating small children will be smaller, and for those whose seats are narrow or constricted, the syringes will be very gentle. Here is a picture of a large syringe:".
The upper part of the nozzle that connects to the penis should be wide like this, having a barrier where it connects to the penis as you see. The lower end that enters the seat is smoothly hollowed out until it reaches the gallbladder on one side and has two holes on one side, and another single hole on the opposite side.
The size of the hole should be as thick as the thickness of the mucus or a little thinner. The penis in which you make the medicine from an animal bladder or sheep gallbladder is made into the shape of a small spoon, its diameter being one span.
It involves making a large number of incisions, as it rotates and has something hard in between each incision. Then, a thin thread from the yarn of ten threads or approximately that enters those holes. The twisting is gathered like a bundle. If medicine is placed in it, pull firmly on the plunger's head between the two stones with a tight and firm pull, then inject it. This is an image of the twisting hole: a circle.
And the method of inhaling it: fill the bladder or a pouch with medicine while it is warmed as much as possible without allowing it to become too hot or too cold. Then, the patient should lie on his back and raise his legs upwards.
He is placed under a pad or blanket. Then, the end of the plunger is greased with grease or chicken white or saliva or similar substances. It then enters the pouch gently. The handler of the twisting device holds both its ends and squeezes it tightly until all contents of the plunger are expelled into the intestines.
Then, the plunger is removed and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medicine stimulates him to urinate, he will expel what he can. If he slept through the night, it was more effective in relieving pain. If it was administered to those with diarrhea and its expulsion was hastened, then repeat the injection until relief occurs.
If there are painful ulcers or tumors in the pouch, make sure that the plunger is very smooth and soft compared to those used for boys, as this is a picture of a gentle plunger with its skin tightened on it:.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the section about treating conditions similar to tumors, and I am now detailing here their treatment through handwork and medication at perfection. Therefore, operations differ depending on what the operation involves and based on where the wound is located.
The things by which operations occur are many, such as breaking a stone, cutting with a sword or knife, thrusting with an arrow or spear and so on, amongst various other things.
As for operations based on the location of the body, they include wounds that occur on the head or neck, chest, abdomen, liver and so on, amongst other bodily organs.
And I am describing the treatment for some operations to serve as standards and rules for all surgeries, particularly beginning with simple head injuries. This is because their explanation will be provided in the initial sections of chapter three of this book.
I say that if there was a simple wound on the head, not involving fracture of bones, and it involved just tearing of skin with no bone injury but resulted in large injury, fearing tumor formation due to hotness inside, I would immediately proceed with removal of the affected area. Do not delay this; bleed him according to the strength of his blood if it does not hinder bleeding and especially if the blood coming out from the wound is little, allowing for bleeding from opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking and heavy foods; if it prevents bleeding, limit food intake, avoid meat and liquids. Apply cold cotton soaked in rose oil or mixed with drinking water on the wound if a hot tumor has appeared.
If the hot tumor has subsided, apply bleeding to the tender wound with its own blood without changing it by the essential oil I will describe shortly. If it was changed due to wind, apply some ointments on him.
Until the pus discharges, then treat it until recovery, if the wound is large and was made by a sword or something similar and its edges didn't meet with reattachment stitches, sew them together using what I describe in stitching surgical wounds.
If the skin covers bone and adheres, but its retention was only in a gently applied stickiness, cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines that harden within, replacing the skin tissue. Instruct the patient to eat foods containing toughness like heads, horns, and similar items, so as to facilitate healing.
If there is a fungus in the skin that doesn't stick to the bone, cut away all the affected area and discard it. Then treat the wound. If in these injuries, a vessel or sweat gland bleeds without stopping with medicine, search for the vessel.
If it hasn't healed, scrape the infection with a scalpel and bind it. If necessity demands and what we have mentioned doesn't work, incise until the bleeding stops. For these small and straightforward injuries, simple care is sufficient; leaving this on her suffices in treatment with only her blood.
Before it is altered by the air, the poultice of ghee takes a part and two parts from saffron and three parts from extinguished or unextinguished tallow. Crush all of them together, sift them, apply them to the wound, pull tightly until they stick well on its surface with a strong pull.
It then clings to the blood, and it is pulled from above with reattachment stitches. It is left without being removed until he doesn't swell; for the medicine does not leave him until he recovers. And sometimes this tallow alone can achieve that if ghee and saffron are not available.
And this action can also be performed with two pieces in many major surgeries if it is properly placed and tightened, and the surgeries bleed easily due to their blood but do not change without being altered by wind. As for when they are somewhat changed or particularly when it's summer time.
There is no effective meaning in placing this poultice on what we have mentioned, whether it carries some ripe ointment or a paste made from the flour of wheat grain with water and honey until pus is produced, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
And if there is a break in the wound that occurred in the bone and it was mild, pull it with glue. I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures as described elsewhere, in neck surgery, if the injury occurs in the neck, then there's no difference between treating wounds and head injuries if they are simple.
And if it is that a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it's a nerve then there's no trick other than avoiding treating it with very tight clamps like pliers and similar as they harm the nerve and irritate it.
And nothing cold is placed on the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection with the brain, which is the finest of organs. The medicine you treat it with should be gentle like the butter dipped in pure water or basted with oil or rose ointment and tamarix root.
And it is also washed with pure water and other metallic stones in this manner and wet ointments. As for when the wound is large, use stitching or join its lips with ligatures then treat it until it heals.
And if the wound has a hole and there is something hidden in its bottom that produces pus, wet it at the lowest point. If an artery was torn in the wound and you've noticed its bleeding, stop it or tie it or knock it out if necessity calls for this action.
If the wound has severed some of the testicles or all of them and they have been removed, sew together the edges of the skin with stitches on the groove of the scrotum. Do not touch the scrotum but smooth it out, then return it to its natural shape after pulling tight with precise tension for several days.
Then, treat him with antiseptic ointments that promote clotting and drying until he recovers. If the wound has affected the bone, drill into it. If there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them or whatever can be extracted. Leave what cannot be removed as long as the wound heals and recovers, making its removal easier.
If the wound is soft, sprinkle it with the tar we described. If it causes bone to grow and turns into ossified tissue, treat it using what's mentioned in its section, concerning chest surgery and between the shoulders.
If it's a wound from a spear or sword and you see an open wound, look closely. If air is coming out of the wound when the patient breathes, know that this is a fatal wound. If there is no opening in the wound and it's soft with blood, do not apply any tar immediately or tighten it up for fear that the blood might be trapped in its opening.
He is summoned to the heart and kills the patient, but make a sticky paste from tar and apply it twice during the day. If this does not affect him, insert a small cloth in the wound mouth to absorb any moisture that comes out of it and ensure the patient lies on his side for the wound.
It does not affect what meets it, and if three days or more have passed since the wound and there is no sweating, poor heart beat, or difficulty in breathing, and you see that all his conditions are good, know that the wound is safe. Treat him with bleeding and other treatments until he recovers.
If you cannot see it or always extend the needle, know that he has become a surgeon's tool through his door. The needle, being on the wound, will not slide what is gathered there, even if it has moved to the chest or back injury; its usefulness is with the advancement of stitching techniques.
If it is large or, indeed, if it is small, if it has affected the bone and broken pieces off from it, examine the wound and act quickly to remove those fragments. If they are clean, leave them alone; if not, let them be until necessary.
It is necessary to cleanse the wound, as it facilitates its removal. As for other acute injuries in other organs, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
The eighty-first chapter.
In abdominal surgeries, the removal of internal organs and their stitching.
A perforation that exposes the abdomen can be large, small or medium-sized. A larger one might cause the excretion of intestines or several segments of intestine, making its reintroduction and stitching more challenging.
A small perforation can also present difficulties from another perspective; it requires that the return of the intestines be harder. If you do not immediately reintroduce them to their place, they may inflate and become thick, making their insertion more difficult. For this reason, among the perforations, the intermediate one is better because it does not make as much difficulty in returning the intestines compared to these two types.
Know that stitching the abdomen involves four aspects. The two stitches used are suitable for stitching the abdomen and other bodily surgeries. The remaining two are specifically designed for all types of injuries, except they specialize in stitching the abdomen.
And I will describe to you one case with explanation and demonstration, saying that if the wound is small and something of the intestines has come out and it is difficult to return it, this occurs for two reasons: either due to the small tear as we said or due to the fact that before cold air expansion was caused in him.
And if this is the case, it should be heated by immersing a sponge or moistened incision in boiling water alone or after having cooked it with basil and saffron and cinnamon until the gas dissolves.
And it can be done using the drink that has been cooked, which is better than water alone in dissolving gas. Once you see that the gas has dissolved, drain the intestines with water that has been cooked with garlic or baker's yeast; thus he easily goes into it.
And if he cannot return after this treatment, cut the tear slightly with the tool that cuts nails. The first surgery works better than cutting when possible. This is out of necessity and inability to find a solution, and this is an example of the instrument:.
It has one side that is bent and limited, while the other side is unlimited. The delicate end should not have a sharp blade but should be slightly rounded. This tool resembles a small soldering iron as you see. If the wound widens and the intestines enter, it should be returned in its natural form.
It has its own place if you can do it, which is better. If the tear is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head. If it's in the upper abdomen, he should have his head and chest raised above his feet.
And similarly, if the breach is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, make your aim and intention always the side where the surgery operation is higher than the other side. Thus, it ought to be used in great surgeries as well as in moderate ones.
And for small surgeries, place it according to what you can manage. Then have a servant or companion at hand who holds the breach with both hands and closes his lips together before revealing something one by one to those involved in sewing.
And this is the common property of singular sewing, which is that you should take one or several needles depending on the size of the wound. Then leave from either side of the breach a portion as hard as a knuckle. Insert only one needle without putting any thread in the edges of the skin. With the margins of my chest beneath the skin from inside until I pierce it from that side. Having gathered together the margins of my skin and the margins of my chest, there are now four threads. Then pull the double thread around the needle many times on both sides so that the edges of the wound meet tightly.
Then leave a portion as hard as an inch nail, and insert another needle. Connect it with the thread in the same way you did with the first needle. You will continue this process for however many needles you need to sew all of the wound. Let them be medium-sized between stiffness and softness.
Because very soft needles cut the flesh and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin. Therefore, it is best for them to be neither too soft nor too thick. Also, do not insert the needle near the edge of the wound if it's tightly done.
So that the flesh does not cut too quickly and the wound does not open before it has closed, nor should you sew too far apart to prevent the wound from healing. Then trim the ends of the needles so they don't harm the patient when sleeping. And provide him with bandages made of cloth from each side that will hold the ends of the needle.
And she leaves it like that until she learns that the wound has healed. This kind of needle sewing is thus more suitable for minor surgeries, as it may suffice to sew them with one or two needles or about that.
And for the second stitch of common sewing, it is to gather by sewing the four edges meaning the edge of the skin and the edge of the wound in one go with a needle containing twisted thread that is neither too thick nor too thin. Then, after pulling this single stitch through these four edges, she will reinsert the needle from where she started herself.
And the thread should be tangled from above the wound, making the sewing according to the stitch of the bag that is tightened by the harness and puts a small space between each stitch and each stitch after tightening the little finger. This stitch is known by all people.
And with this stitch, I performed a surgery presented to a man in his abdomen who was stabbed by a sword. The incision in the surgery exceeded one foot and it came out from his intestines about two feet of the middle intestine. The cut was in the center of the belly.
And I reinserted it after he held his intestines outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived for many years afterwards, conducting himself normally. The doctors judged that he would never fully recover.
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with medicine because there was no medication available in my place. Instead, I would change the used cotton on his wound twice a day and promised to wash it with honey water until he recovered.
And as for the two types of special sewing, I remember Galen's word on this which is to start sewing from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When you pull out the needle in the skin and through the muscle that runs straight across the whole belly.
It leaves the margin of the canthus in the side where the needle was inserted and performed its passage through the other margin from inside to outside. If it has been done so, then do it again within this same margin from outside to inside in the bladder.
And make the margin of the canthus in this side, and pass the needle through its other margin from inside to outside. And execute it through the canthus to the margin of the bladder on its side until all of it is passed through.
Then begin also from the same side and align it with the margin of the canthus that is on the other side, and remove the needle from the skin near him, then return it to this skin and align the margin of the canthus on the other side with this margin in the bladder.
And remove it from the skin on its side, do this again and repeat until you suture all of the surgery according to that example. And in essence, this suturing method is like sewing the hair follicles of the fur.
That is to suture the canthus in one direction with the margin of the skin and leave it from the other side until emptying, while the second type of special suturing that Galen also mentioned is his exact word.
He refers to the method where some of the practitioners sew it in a pattern similar to that which they apply to their patients, by bringing together every part with its counterpart issue naturally. This results in joining the margin of the canthus to its other margin, and the margin of the bladder to its other margin. This is exactly how I describe it for you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle in the bladder margin close to you from outside and carry it inside only her, then let my canthus alone. Then return the needle and carry it from outside to inside in both margins of the canthus, then also return it again.
The execution is from inside to outside within the margin of the other bladders on the opposite side, which are on the side opposite. This method of sewing is better than the common easy sewing that he mentions, this is Galen's statement in text form, and some have said that stomach sewing can be done with two needles. And that is to insert one thread into them and start by inserting the needle from your side, then executing it to the other side and inserting another needle from the opposite side, performing this according to the way of sewing loops either way.
And know that if the puncture is in the middle of the abdomen, its sewing is harder than any other part of the abdomen. As for healing the wound, its treatment rule is like that of other wounds: when you see the wound moistened with blood before it changes due to air and by applying the salve and stitching it firmly, make sure to apply the necessary antiseptic.
And if the wound has changed due to air, apply some ointments that you prepare until it discharges and the threads fall out, then it heals properly. Then treat it like any other wound until it is cured.
And if no medicine prepares, apply it since it begins to discharge old cottony pus and replace it twice during the day as I taught you until it heals. In most cases, you do not need another treatment if the wounds are simple, because you fear that the wound will share the main organs in pain.
It is necessary to immerse a small piece of wool in moderately heated oil or rose butter, and place it around the areas between the armpits and elbows. If you feel pain or itching with its application, this often occurs; so, you can alleviate it by drinking a strong black fuming water.
And indeed, if the gangrene has reached the intestines and become an open wound into its cavity, know that what was hard in them is easier to heal, and what was delicate in them is harder to heal.
And as for the intestines known by the term of fasting, they do not accept healing through surgery where there is an essential defect, due to their abundance of veins and bones, and softness of their wall, and proximity to nerve nature. And as for if what emerged from the wound was a hole that has been found smoothly, return it according to your intestinal response, whether or not it's like your intestines' response.
If it has passed some time and turned green or black, it should be desirable to tighten a thread over the area that is darkened from him so as not to expose bleeding. There are veins and arteries in the hole, then cut what is beneath this ligament.
And make both ends of the thread attached from below outside the surgery, making it easier for you to pull and remove them when the hole drops and the wound heals. Remember the wound that appears in the intestines, but if there was a breach in the intestines and it was small.
It is possible that some people may be forced because I have seen a person who was bleeding inside his abdomen from an arrow wound, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. I left the wound and it became red and was discharging feces and gas from it, so I raised him on bed and did not hope for his healing. And I continued to care for him until he recovered and the area healed. When I saw that the area had healed, I feared that something bad might happen to his abdomen, so there was no incident of a serious defect for him, and he remained in the best condition. He who is true can eat, drink, copulate, enter the bath and serve in his duty. It has been mentioned by some of those with experience that when it was shown a tear during surgery and if it was small, it should be treated according to this description.
He instructs that the larger ants should be taken by their heads, then both sides of the wound are gathered together. An ant is placed there with its mouth open on both sides of the wound. When it grabs onto it and tightens its mouth, its head gets cut off, for it sticks and does not dissolve. Then another ant is placed near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then reverse it and suture the wound. Those heads remain stuck inside during the healing until the tissue heals completely without causing any harm in the process. It's possible that the organ can also be stitched with a fine thread.
The one who removes the sticky animal from Egypt after it enters an iron rod, which is that he takes a tip of this thread from the Egyptian, then pulls smoothly and ties a thin cotton thread to its end. Then he puts that thread into the needle. There is an Egyptian thread that passes through the organ, then it returns to the abdomen. This type of sewing with ants and Egyptian threads is on the path of greed and hope.
And if the tear is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the thin intestines, there's no trick and no permanent cure.
The sixty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of sore throat and laryngitis.
Know that every wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic and progresses, turns into a ulcer without healing, always discharging pus which never stops. It is called phlegmonous in any body part. We call this condition a sore throat, and the term "nauctor" is used.
It is indeed a complex intertwined solid white lump without pain, having a cavity like that of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some of them call it a feather, and at times it can be wet discharging phlegm constantly. There might be periods where the wetness stops. The wetness could sometimes be abundant, sometimes scarce, thick, or thin.
In the section discussing surgeries, it is mentioned that every wound that does not heal and does not regenerate tissue could be attributed to one of nine causes. One of these reasons might be due to a lack of blood in the body, or perhaps it's sluggishness, or possibly because there is hard tissue inside and on its edges which prevents the growth of healthy flesh. Alternatively, it could be due to excessive pus and contamination, or perhaps the wound itself is infected with a poor quality substance causing deterioration. It might also be because the treatment for her isn't suitable, or there was an infection in the locality of bubonic plague, or it may have a specific characteristic related to that area.
Alternatively, it could be due to excessive pus and contamination, or perhaps the wound itself is infected with a poor quality substance causing deterioration. It might also be because the treatment for her isn't suitable, or there was an infection in the locality of bubonic plague, or it may have a specific characteristic related to that area. As was displayed in the city of Sargastra where it is difficult for diseases to mature and natural recovery from tumors proceeds slowly, or perhaps because there is one or several bones within. All these reasons and their symptoms along with their treatment using medicine have been illustrated in this section.
And here, I should inform you about the treatment of syphilis and scrofula which is performed by hand operation. Know that ulcers can occur in all parts of the body; some of them end up in large arteries or veins or nerves.
Or to the chest, or to the spleen, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a joint in many composed joints like the hand and foot, and some lead to proximity of an organ such as the main member and so on.
What belongs to these procedures in this manner they are from the easy diseases that cannot accept treatment and the concern about them is a hassle and ignorance, if what belongs to these procedures did not reach these places I mentioned, hoped for, and desired the treatment of.
And I wanted to gain knowledge of that, take a copper or iron probe, if the nacour passes in straightness, pierce it with it. If there is a curvature in the nacour, inspect it with a thin lead probe because lead is soft on its body.
It smooths upon entry and bends towards the curvature, if the nacour has many mouths you cannot rely on with the probe inspect one of them. The moisture that it injects flows toward the other mouths and drains.
From there, proceed with the examination in any way you can to determine if there is bone or nerve, or whether the nacour has a far or near base, or if it has one nacour with many mouths; assess all of this within your capacity to effectively use your insufficient experience in feeling the pain at your hand's touch on that area.
Such are the indications and reasons for the tumor, if you stand upon all of this with truthful standing and truthfulness, then proceed with treatment with confidence; assuming it is (the condition).
The nacour seems near or in a healthy place away from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places mentioned to you; cut the nacour based on my previous description and remove the necrotic tissue and excess flesh within it.
What grows in its mouth from flesh or ulcers etcetera, treat it until it heals. If the nacour is far into the base and straight; it should be cut deep as possible then clean it of all of its necrotic flesh.
Then use the ground pellet in the strong medicines and insert it into the bottom of the stomach, which you reach with iron. Do this several times until that strong medicine consumes all that remains of decay at the bottom of the stomach.
Then force him with the nourishments that promote true healing until he recovers. If he does not recover in this way, treat him according to what was previously described. If the cause of the stomach disorder is large and it's appropriate for you, puncture and open it as you were told. If there is an obstacle preventing you from doing so, do whatever necessary treatment.
If it is a bone or nerve or major organ as we said, if you find the bone has some decay and darkness inside, scrape it until all the decay disappears. Then treat it with what promotes healing so that he recovers. If it doesn't help and his sickness continues like before, do what necessary treatments.
Remember that you haven't removed all the decay yet, so uncover everything on it again and thoroughly inquire and cleanse it with your utmost effort. Then force him, if he recovers. Otherwise, know that this decay is from a deeper area of the body, so uncover everything on it again.
Thoroughly inquire, and cleanse it with your utmost effort. If the decayed bone is a small one and you can extract it, then use gentle hooks suitable for this purpose to pull out the decayed bone.
If the bones are numerous, thoroughly inquire and extract all of them, leaving nothing. Your effort should not be spared in this process. If something from the ligaments obstructs you without posing a risk during cutting, cut those ligaments as well as any surrounding flesh and free up the bones.
If it does not allow you to extract the bones due to time constraints, cover the wound with what cleanses it and leave it for a few days until it clears around those bones of flesh and ligaments. Take care not to let the wound close over the cut you made during your work.
Place on him, if you fear it, a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur and oil or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian balsam or one of the green balms. Once these bands have disinfected and healed the bones, they make the removal and attraction easier.
If it is a large bone such as the thigh bone or that kind, and if only its surface was affected by decay, then strip it completely down to the marrow until the blackness and decay go away. Then set the wound under pressure. If the decay has reached inside the bone itself for a major part, spreading the bone will be inevitable.
Cut it all up until you reach where the decay ends. Then, apply treatment until it heals. I will tell you about an old man who was given a case of lameness in his leg as an example for your remedy and guidance on how to treat you. This man had aged.
Somewhere around the age of thirty, he was presented with pain in his leg due to irritation from inside the body until the materials reached the leg causing swelling and the formation of a large tumor. There was no external cause. As time passed with medical mistakes, the tumor eventually opened.
Many materials came out and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became infected with numerous mouths all producing pus and bodily moisture. A group of doctors treated him for around two years, but there was no one among them skilled in hand surgery.
Until I saw his leg and the materials seeping from those mouths, a torrential stream, and the man had deteriorated in his body and turned yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those mouths; it led to the bone through the probe. Then, I fished out all the mouths.
I found that some of them connect to each other from all directions of the leg, so I probed one of these cavities until I revealed a part of the bone. I found it hollow, blackened, corroded and gnawed until the hole reached the marrow, spreading what was disclosed to me.
I removed the rotten bone, thinking that there is no other corruption in the bone which I have cut and spread. Then I had it cauterized with ointments for a longer period but it did not heal. So I went back and revealed the bone again over the first exposure.
I found that the corruption was connected to the bone, spreading even what had appeared to me of this corruption. I then forced it but it did not heal and did not adhere again. So, I exposed it once more. And as long as I continued cutting parts of the bone while applying the cauterization treatment, it would not adhere, until I cut about a foot of the bone.
I removed his knee joint, then applied ointments for cauterization. It healed very quickly and he was cured. Such repetition in his case required due to the weakness of his condition, and his low resistance, with my fear that he might die as he experienced excessive loss at all times due to over-exhaustion which became severe, being fully healed from this complete cure.
A solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and her health was restored within his body. His strength diminished and he behaved according to his conditions without any harm from walking which could fundamentally affect him, if the bone had broken at a part of the body.
You should apply this method which involves taking a band and tightening it at the end of the formed bone, instruct someone to extend it upwards, then another band made from thicker wool than the first one.
Then connect it to the flesh under the bone and extend its end so that it attracts the flesh downwards while you expose the flesh from where you want to spread it in order not to harm the flesh. Then place a board or plank firmly underneath the bone from below.
Because if you do this, the file does not cut off the decayed bone. It should be advisable for spreading a little above the site of decay to prevent any disease from occurring inside the bone which would not appear externally causing you to spread it again.
If the bone is decayed and not naturally occurring but connects to itself, with disease in its center or in some parts of it, expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the plank from below, then spread it from the first side where the decay occurs.
After spreading it from one side, spread it from the other side as well. Keep the spreading a little distance away from the decay following what we said earlier. If the decay is in an articulation, cut out the decayed part of the joint itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in a connection between two joints, there's no trick other than amputation. If the decay is in the hand or foot fork, the matter of its treatment is extremely difficult, but it should be peeled off however much you can see and stripped and cleaned to whatever extent you can.
And with what trick do you align yourself when you are not obstructed by sweat or nerve, and know that the cuts and joints for these bones vary greatly depending on the position of the bones, their orientation, hardness, porosity, size, smallness, stiffness, and fragility. Therefore, it should be prepared for each type of work a tool tailored to that work.
Know that the works themselves can guide you on the type of instrument you need if you have a long way to go and knowledge in the arts of this trade, because skill in the trade and witnessing various diseases is important. He can deduce what instruments are suitable for each disease for himself, and I will show you several instruments at the end of this chapter.
Make them examples to follow and criteria by which you measure others if God willing, an example of a scalpel:.
Another saw image:.
A small saw image:.
A large saw image:.
This simple tool has a head in the shape of an awl and its design is like that of an engraving on a horse bit. If joints become rotten or have large bones, it can be used to carve them. Another smaller simple tool:
A wide simple tool image:.
Its upper arc and teeth are made of iron, its handle is made of well-polished wood, and it has a hole in the simple tool image.
A gentle simple tool image:.
A simple tool image with a curved end:.
A small simple tool image resembling an awl:.
A small cutout image:.
Its tip is like a hook, it operates in many places on the skeleton's surface. A simple tool image suitable for removing parts of bones that have broken off:.
A triangular sharp-edged tool is made of Indian iron, and it should be made as we have described all the instruments and cutting pieces. An illustration will suffice.
The seventy-eighth chapter.
In the chapter of amputations and dislocation of bones.
Limbs may putrefy either from a cause external or internal. If this evil is treated with medicines and the cure fails, and if you observe that the putrefaction advances in the limb resisting nothing, then amputation becomes necessary.
It is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the putrefaction has spread, so that death or a great suffering due to it would be preferable to losing the limb. A sign of someone having experienced this is when the limb persists until you think that fire had burnt it.
Or if it putrefies after the blackness spreads, and if this fungus advances to the region below that limb and enters into a whole part of the body, then proceed with amputation. Similarly, if the cause of putrefaction is due to stings from sea snakes or snakes or leeches and such, take action accordingly.
If putrefaction or swelling affects a finger, amputate the finger immediately. Do not allow the disease to spread to the hand. Similarly, if it invades the hand, cut off the hand from its base to the wrist, and do not wait until it advances to the elbow.
Likewise, if it invades the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the disease spreads further down towards the knee, do not just amputate the knee; this can lead to death of the patient. Instead, use other remedies based on your capabilities until you are able to move forward with amputation if necessary.
And likewise, if the decay reaches the finger, amputate the finger at the first joint. If it reaches the penis shaft, amputate the entire organ. If it advances to the thigh, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the decay has reached above the knee, there is no solution other than to leave it and allow the patient to die. To amputate or spread the disease, tie a bandage at the place you want to cut and another one above that area.
The attendant stretches the lower band to below and the attendant for the upper band stretches it above. You then remove the flesh between the two bands with a wide scythe until all the flesh is revealed, after which you cut or spread it out. It should be ensured that there are small cuts in all directions with the cotton thread.
So that the blade doesn't cut the correct spot and cause unnecessary pain or a hot boil, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cover the area or place it on some clotting agents for blood then proceed to treating until you have finished.
Then, bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And let me provide you with an example of this particular case I am describing to you, which occurred in a man's leg with a darkness that resembles fire burns.
And that decay was the first occurrence in his finger, until he lost all of it. When the man saw that the decay was advancing within the body with extreme pain and burning, he cut off at the joint when it became necessary. And he healed.
And after a long time, that same decay appeared in his ring finger of his left hand. He came to me and I treated it with the medicines I had carried on my hands after cleaning him up. The improvement did not stop, and instead, it continued advancing into the other finger.
Until the corruption took hold, he called me to cut off his hand, I refused him my insistence on avoiding such a loss and was also afraid of his death when cutting his hand off because his strength seemed to be collapsing. When he failed with me, he returned to his homeland.
I heard from him that he cut off his hand completely because of it, and this story is told to be a guide when such incidents occur for this type of disease, and to serve as a reference to follow.
The eightieth chapter.
In treatment of abscesses and the method of administering medications to them.
If a tumor occurs in some of the fleshly organs and grows to such an extent that it accumulates for a period until it explodes or bursts, and all that was inside it from the duration comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were a container.
The skin on it is like a breach, having become loose and was not extensively corrupted to affect bone or nerve or muscle. This is why it's named an abscess; it didn't qualify as necrosis until its duration allowed for corruption of parts of these organs.
Then, it is called a necrosis or scarring. Its treatment involves cutting out that skin completely as it normally turns and most importantly if it has become loose like a breach and you've confirmed it doesn't stick to the site due to its corruption.
If you hope for the skin to stick, and its corruption didn't reach this extent in it, and there is a thickening of flesh within the skin, treat him with an injection. This involves examining the abscess; if it's large and the pus from which it discharges has an unpleasant smell, then medicate it with Egyptian medicine.
This is a recipe for preparing a medicinal compound. The ingredients are honey, oil, sugar syrup, and jalap (a type of pepper). They are mixed together in a pot and cooked over fire until the mixture thickens, similar to the consistency of thickened honey. Then, one takes some of it according to need and mixes it with water and honey. It is then poured into the opening of something that needs treatment, its mouth is tied shut, and the medicine is left inside for about two hours.
Then, it is squeezed through pressing for several days until the contents of what needs treatment is cleansed and the scum disappears. If this medicine isn't available, you can use ash water. You take the charcoal from olive wood or oakwood, and pour water over it.
Then, clean it out until you are sure that what needs treatment is cleaned. If there isn't enough water for it, use Egyptian medicine or ash water. In case neither of these options is available, pour in water mixed with honey, and add a bit of ground jalap to the mixture.
Or you can use honey and wine mixed together, as the honey tends to cleanse and wash away dirt. The wine sticks to what needs treatment, especially if there is a preference for its grip quality which dries out the wound. After doing this several times until you are sure that the wound has been cleansed of its foulness, you should pour in fluids that promote tissue growth.
For example, you might take the snake venom ointment and mix it with rose oil or a sticky drink, or inject it using some other ointments or medicines whose properties we have proven in our article on ointments. If the opening of what needs treatment is narrow and does not allow for a syringe tube to fit inside.
Gently expand it with iron or place a twisted thread in the Egyptian ointment or the serpentine's ointment so that it widens. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, stitch its lips together and leave it to an extent where there's no excess room for the syringe to enter when injecting the medicine.
And similarly, if the place from which pus flows out of his mouth is elevated above the level of the jaw bone, it cuts through at the lowest point there where pus can flow down because pus when obstructed in the hollow chamber of its hiding spot prevents meat from growing there.
And if you are unable to cut towards the bottom of the hollow chamber as desired, then position the organ so that pus flows out of it easily according to what becomes available. And let there be nothing left in the hollow chamber that could contain any pus at all.
And as for the plasters made of salt that are placed on the hollow chamber from outside and how to place them on it, you should take one of the salt plasters prepared according to what is desired and spread it over a cotton wick, so that the wick covers the entire hollow chamber. Then, using the scissors in front of the hollow chamber's mouth, make a hole slightly larger than the mouth of the hollow chamber. Next, spread another layer of soft plaster on another wick to match the size of the hole and place it on top, spaced away from the mouth of the hollow chamber so that pus can easily flow out. Do not remove the large wick until later.
For several days, and as for the one at the mouth of the hollow chamber, it is the one you remove whenever needed to let out whatever pus has accumulated, and to know if what flows out is much or little, ripe or not ripe.
And yet, you should also examine the location of the hollow chamber itself to see if its owner feels pain or not and whether there is a tumor in it or not. If your treatment progresses like this and you notice that the substance coming out is small at the mouth of the hollow chamber.
'Know that if the hollow chamber has stuck together or is close to sticking, then on the morrow or on the third day you will need to remove it. And when the wound has healed, replace the wick with another and renew the plaster. If pus comes out of the hollow chamber after a long period, do not despair that it might stick again.'
Healing varies among people, for some delay the growth of flesh in their surgeries while others oppose this. If pus appeared long after their operation instead of ripe healing, it means that whatever was hidden inside did not stick to the wound. Therefore, if the reattachment of what was hidden inside is delayed, know that it didn't adhere properly.
And in his endeavor, he increased the drying of medicines. Let it be that some medicines have their essence wet and their strength dry; for example, the camelina pastile if it has been added more, a preference increases for adding more of the ghee (a type of fat). And among what is most effective for treatment, take the camelina pastile.
It can be solved by using a mixture of red onion juice and adding to it a moderate amount of old, diluted vinegar. Then mix this concoction together and use it. If the camelina pastile does not have honey even after being cooked until it becomes white and then used or if you take vinegar, patience and kenador (a type of herb), crush all these ingredients with them and leave them on top of the honey while it's heated. Then apply it onto a thin layer, tighten on the bandage or apply it with honey that was cooked until it thickens and then add medications and place the cloth and tighten it.
And it can be used in such cases as the long zinc rod, and the stem of the black walnut tree, and wheat flour from the garlic chives and the cantaloupe, whether they are used individually or mixed together then crushed, sifted, and placed on top of the honey I described and used. If the healing process of the bandage lasts longer than expected using this treatment, it means there is decay in its root.
And it has affected bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, the treatment of nacoura (a type of herb) will be applied as previously stated.
The ninety-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of inflammation and abscesses under nails, excision of the extra finger, and incisions between fingers.
The abscess is flesh that grows abundantly under the thumb nail or foot, and perhaps in other fingers. If left untreated, it inflates and becomes hot.
Or, if it corrupts the nail bed until it eats away at the nail and possibly destroys it entirely. It might reach corruption to the bone to have a stench coming from him. The end of the finger would become wide and change its color like redness. If you treat it with what we mentioned in this section and your treatment did not work.
You should cut with iron all the excess that grows from the nail, then dress the wound. This is very effective with cutting. If the bone and nail are healthy.
The folding part of the nail had pushed the flesh inwards and was causing it to shrink and become inflamed. It is necessary to place a thin bandage under the folding part of the nail that causes the flesh to shrink, lift it upwards, and gently cut away that piece of flesh.
You should apply medicine that is burned to the remaining flesh until it disappears completely. Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If decay has affected the bone, you should cut out that bone and remove it. For as long as there is decayed bone within, it will not heal at all.
If you see the thickening and decay advancing in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as described before, then treat it until it heals. If a blow or sting affected the nail bed and caused intense pain, it is necessary to split out the pus first.
Then the blade of the scalpel is cut with a sharp incision, which deviates from above to below. It is preserved not to reach the flesh beneath the nail because this causes severe pain and becomes a cause for extra flesh growth at that spot. Then, the affected area is treated with what calms pains.
And as for the extra finger that is born in some people's hands, it might be all flesh, or it might have bones in some parts of it. It could also contain a nail and have some of its growth at the base of a joint in some fingers.
Or, her growth could be in some parts of the phalanx that grows in some parts of the finger and does not move. The one growing at the joint of the finger might have moved, but what was from it being only flesh has been cut off easily. This is because you cut it off from its base with a wide scalpel.
And as for the one that grows at the base of the joint, her treatment is difficult because it resists being cut off. As for the one that grows in a finger near one of the phalanges, it should be necessary to first cut off its flesh in a straight slice towards the bone. Then, expand the bone with any of those levers suitable for this case.
Then he treats it until it heals. And as for the adhesion that occurs between some of the fingers, it often happens and comes from what humans produce, causing during closure or burning with fire and such situations, so it should be to cut through this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place between them a strip or perforation in rose oil so that it does not heal quickly and separates between them or leaves a thin sheet of lead between them until it disappears as necessary.
And similarly, if the union of some fingers with the back of the hand is presented, then cut that union according to what becomes ready and fits with the shape of the limb.
The ninety-first chapter.
In cutting ligaments.
The ligaments are twisted, thickened blood vessels filled with blackish fluid that occur in most body parts and more frequently in the legs. Notably in the femoral artery, popliteal veins, saphenous veins, and tibial veins. It should be noted that initially you should empty the body from the black urine several times vigorously.
Then cut her basilic vein. As for treating it with iron, there are two ways: one involves cutting and removing the black blood and its appearance, and the other involves sweating out the sweat with everything else. With regard to cutting, the leg should first be immersed in hot water for a long time.
Until the thick, viscous blood dissolves. Then lift the leg of the patient from above his thigh to below his knee with an apron. Then sweat out in one place or in two places or in three wide cuts.
Then, using your hand, drain the black blood from the bottom of the leg to above and from above to below until you remove as much blood as you consider sufficient or what you can tolerate according to the strength of the patient. Then bandage him/her and order him/her to avoid foods that produce black urine. The process of sweating out and cutting is repeated.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for sweating, it should be done in this manner: shave the leg if there is a lot of hair. Then let him take hot baths and immerse his leg in hot water until it reddens and starts to sweat or he engages in vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available for the body to heat, then cut the skin along until the sweat, either at its end in the knee or at the bottom at the ankle. Then open the skin with grooves and scrape out the sweat from each side until it appears to touch.
When it appears, you see it red and swollen. Once removed from the skin, you'll notice it resembles a ligament, then insert beneath it until it rises out of the skin; hang it by a dark smooth string. Then make another cut near that one about three finger widths away.
Then, scrape the skin above the sweat until it shows. Lift it with a tool as you did before and hang it by another dark smooth string like the first one. Then, make another cut or many cuts if needed.
Then, soak it and cut it at the end of this incision near the ankle. Pull it and soak it again until it comes out of the second cut. Then pull it towards the cut above and do that until you pull it from the third hole high up all cuts; once everything has come out, cut it.
If you cannot pull and soak it, insert a needle with strong thread doubled and tie it. Pull the tied thread and push through it with your fingers until it comes out, make sure not to let it break. If it breaks, it will become very difficult for you to soak it again.
A poultice is applied to it. After it has soaked through, place on the site of the wounds wool soaked in a mixture of wine and ointment or oil, and treat until he heals. If the ulcer is irregular with grooves that tend towards sides,
It is necessary that it be straight as we said earlier. When cutting at every part and location of its folds and soft areas, then attach to the sutures until it adheres to them all, and when cutting exercise caution not to cut or damage sweat glands since this will make opening difficult for you. Try to avoid such actions.
The picture of the nail groove through which you would cut.
The image of the dark suture:.
It should not have a plating like the other sutures, nor should it be sharp at its tip lest it cuts sweat glands. It must bend smoothly and be firm because if it is thin it may cut by its sharpness; however, it has an advantage of being firm as we said.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In opening the common sweat glands.
This sweat gland originates in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, as well as in other hot regions with low sweating, and it might originate elsewhere on the body besides the legs. It is produced due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
Similar to what happens inside living organisms, the fat, pus, bubbling, and formed pus between the skin and flesh. A sign of the beginning of this sweat production is an intense reddening in the leg followed by the area puffing out, then sweat starts to emerge from that puffed-up spot.
It behaves like the root of a plant or an animal; when one part appears, it should wrap around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams. Tie it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Every time something comes out to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it lasts for a long time, cut off some of it and wrap the rest; do not cut it from its root before all of it has come out, because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing inflammation and pus formation at the site, resulting in a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be moved and drawn gradually until it comes out of the other end and nothing remains in the body. It may produce exudate in some people that is five spans long and ten spans in length.
I have heard that for a man it could come out twenty spans long. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a thread into the hole and pull it slowly and gently with the body until everything inside has drained out. Try to treat the wound by applying ointments for days.
Then, he treated it with the treatment for tumors. This exudate might have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint or body of the leg, causing multiple mouths to open and a branch to come out from each mouth. He treated it as we mentioned earlier in the sections and what was previously explained.
The second and ninety-first chapter.
In the cut made on the worm that is produced under the gallbladder, it is called the cow's cause.
This disease is called "the cow's cause" in some of our countries because it happens frequently to cows, and it's a small single worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and it spreads throughout the body both upwards and downwards.
It is noticeable when touched, spreading from one organ to another until it breaches the skin at a point and comes out. It forms through inflammation of some mixtures as happens with worms and ticks in the belly, causing pus.
If it occurs in her, one expects that if she proliferates within the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, then perhaps it might open there and come out, which could render the eye useless. This happens frequently. If you want to treat her or remove her, this can only be done by a surgeon when they appear to the touch.
You should tighten the area above and below it with a strong tourniquet. Then cut it open and remove her, if she has sunk into the flesh and not found her, carry on to that place with fire until you burn her, and avoid causing damage to the eye as we have said.
If you see that she has become near the eye in the head, tighten under it on the forehead with a strong tourniquet. Then cut her open and remove her. The diseased person should cleanse his body with medications that ease the mixing of bad mucus and be cautious about food that may cause infection.
The Third Chapter, Ninety.
In cutting the disease known as nafir.
This disease, which in our country is called nafir, is pain that manifests in some organs then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as described for you.
I was called to attend a diseased woman in some rural areas. I exposed her arm and there was a slight swelling in the sweat of her elbow's vein, which after an hour, I saw that this swelling increased with each movement like a worm rising up towards its head as fast as it could, like lead.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain leaves that area and settles in the elbow. After an hour, it flows throughout the entire body until it reaches the other arm. It was told to me that her whole body rotates like what I saw.
I was amazed by the speed of its transfer from one member to another, and I had never seen this disease so clearly in this form before. Indeed, I have observed a group who found the pain spreading from one member to another, but I saw it with my eyes as I do in this woman.
I only understood this to be due to the fact that the woman was from nomadic desert dwellers with exposed bodies, hence it became clear to feel that moving breeze and it was bound not to appear under these conditions in those who are wealthy and have their bodies covered by clothes.
If you want to treat him and he feels pain, it will appear to you clearly as we have mentioned. Then apply pressure above and below him with the wheel and cut him until that trapped wind comes out and clean the area.
If you do not see it with your eyes, treat him by sweating out his body and what drives away the winds like henna paste and bleeding like that of bloodletting and similar medications.

In the removal of arrows.
Arrows can vary according to their types and the positions they occur in the body. As for the variation by type, some are large and small, others have hollow glass or etched glass, while there are those with three angles and four angles.
Some arrows have tongues and others have fragments. As for those that occur according to the organs they are in, there are two types: organs of primary importance like brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, stomach and bladder etc., which tend to be hollow. When a dart hits one of these organs and you observe the signs of death that I am about to describe, it should be avoided to remove the dart from there. Death will often befall its owner regardless. When these bad signs do not appear and the dart is not buried deep in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the symptoms of the brain, if a dart hits it and pierces through the bones causing injury to the skull above the brain, one will experience intense headache, nausea, and dizziness due to this.
When these bad signs do not appear and the dart is not buried deep in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the symptoms of the brain, if a dart hits it and pierces through the bones causing injury to the skull above the brain, one will experience intense headache, nausea, and dizziness due to this. A redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, confusion, vomiting might occur. Sometimes blood could come out from the nostrils or ears, speech may be lost and sound disappears. White moist discharge resembling dough might appear from the wound, which flows like a meaty liquid.
If you observe these signs, do not attempt to treat or remove the dart. If the symptoms relate to the heart and it is near the left breast, feeling as if it's stuck in a solid thing rather than an empty space.
Perhaps the dart moves like a heartbeat and blood flows from the wound that is black. Following this, limbs weaken, cold sweat appears and confusion occurs; know that death is imminent. If the dart wounds the lung, blood with a greasy consistency might come out from the wound.
The veins around the neck swell, the pus changes color and has a loud breathing pattern, seeking to inhale cold air. If the dart hits the pericardium in the chest, it's near the smaller ribs, having heavy breathing with intense pain.
Heaving and all pelvic organs move, if the dart hits the liver it follows with intense pain and blood coming out of the wound that resembles its color. If the dart hits the stomach, perhaps food-like substance comes out of the wound which is not absorbed.
If it is evident that the arrow has penetrated the abdomen and caused bleeding, or if something from the feces comes out of the wound or abscess or perforation, there is no hope for its treatment nor in removing the arrow. If the arrow had penetrated the bladder and urine was being discharged.
Something came out from it to the outside and the pain intensified for the patient. Know that he is dead. As for other organs such as the face, eye, neck, shoulder, back, vertebral column, forearm, leg and so on, they have accepted the worst of situations.
If the arrow did not hit a vessel or nerve, and the arrow was not poisoned, I will inform you about some of what I have seen regarding these arrows to help you in your treatment. Specifically, an arrow had struck a man in his eye's socket near the root of his nose.
I removed it for him from the other side, under his earlobe and he was clear, nothing unpleasant happened to his eye, I removed another arrow which hit a Jew in the eyelid below his lower eyelash. The arrow had disappeared and only its small tip stuck into the wood remained.
An arrow was large, one of the composite arrows of the Cossacks, square iron, smooth with no eyes. It cleared the Jew and nothing bad happened to his eye. I removed another arrow from the neck of a Samaritan. The arrow was Arab-made.
There is one who has two eyes, he split him between the scrotal sacs and had penetrated his neck. He was able to remove it gently until he extracted it from him, thus sparing the Samaritan and leaving him unharmed. I removed another arrow for a man who had hit his abdomen with it, we estimated that he would die from it.
After thirty days or about that time, when nothing changed in his condition and he remained the same, I extracted the arrow from him. I made him healthy and free of any complications, without suffering any bad events afterwards. Then I saw a man hit by an arrow on his back; I treated the wound.
After seven years, the arrow reappeared at its original point in his heel. I saw a woman who had an arrow hit her in her abdomen; it got stuck and remained there without any change in her condition or experiencing anything unusual, nor did she find any harm in her natural actions.
I saw another man hit in the face by an arrow; it healed without causing much pain. There are many like this, and I extracted an arrow from a soldier of the Sultan who had been struck in the middle of his nose leaning slightly to the right.
The arrow disappeared completely. I was summoned to treat him three days after the arrow fell, and I found a very narrow wound from the arrow. I probed it with a fine probe but did not feel anything; he had tissue damage and pain under his right ear due to the wound's opening.
I concluded that the tissue was torn by the arrow. I treated the wound with a dressing containing a strong adhesive and encouraged it to swell, hoping for an indication of improvement or showing of the arrow's presence. However, when I punctured him again, there were no occurrences suggesting that the arrow had reached its destination.
I continued the dressing for many days, but no event occurred. It sealed within that wound and remained a nuisance until I felt the arrow inside his nose one day. Upon hearing this news, I applied strong medication to the wound for several days.
Until it was opened and pricked, I felt the sharp end of the arrow which sticks in the wood. Then I increased this treatment with that strong medicine until we could see the tip of the arrow clearly and it took me a period of time around four months.
Then, as the wound expanded and enabled me to insert needles into it which were pulling at it, they didn't respond to coming out. So I kept treating them and changed my position towards them with different types of devices until one day I held them together with tight needles as their image will be shown in the last page of this chapter.
And the doctors used to judge that his nasal cartilage does not harden, so they made it hard and healed the wound completely; nothing will ever harm him again. I am telling you how some arrows are removed for comparison and as an example which is equivalent to what I have not yet mentioned.
Because parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped through description, nor can they fully encompass a book. It is only the skilled craftsman who measures little by much, using what he has at hand to infer what is missing, and devises new actions and new machines when faced with unusual circumstances.
If I were to leave this craft, I would say that the arrows only exit from the organs in which they took root in two ways: either by being pulled out from the place where they entered or from the opposite side of the organ, and it exits from the point of entry.
Either the arrow is protruding in a piece of flesh, pulling and exiting if it does not resist your efforts to remove it within its proper time. In which case you should leave it for days until the flesh around it decays, making it easier to pull out and remove it similarly, if it took root in bone.
If it doesn't force you to leave, leave it also for days and return it each day with pulling and moving every day; if it leaves, then after some days there should be a small puncture around the arrow in the same bone from each side until widening around the arrow then pulling and removing it.
If the arrow is deeply lodged in a bone of the head and has penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, causing some of those symptoms I mentioned to you, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until it heals its situation after a few days.
When you are engaging in pulling out the arrow, if it is deeply embedded and doesn't force you to pull, use the small holes around the arrow as described. Then treat the affected area until it heals. If the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body. And if you lost your sense of touch, poke it with a probe. If he feels it, pull him with some tools that are suitable for pulling. If you cannot do it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow in the hole, without any bone or nerve or sweat gland.
Cut him until the wound widens and you can get to the arrow, in order to remove it. If he has two ears, hold them. Extract the deeply embedded flesh from both sides of each ear with all your tricks, as long as you are unable to extract the flesh without breaking the ears, cut them open until you do.
And when you try to remove the arrow in any place, use your fingers by sliding them to all sides until you extract it. Be as gentle as possible so that the arrow does not break and make it harder for you to pull it out and remove it. If you cannot do this within your time limit.
Leave it for days until the surrounding tissues decay, then continue. It becomes easier at that point. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its section and exercise caution when cutting a vein, nerve or tendon. Instead, employ the trick.
You can release the arrow in every way you want, do it gently and carefully as I instructed. It should be advisable to adopt your stance to that which was in place when the arrow hit you, as this is more effective. When pulling back the arrow, make sure your posture resembles the position before the impact of the arrow; this technique yields better results.
If you can't do that, use whatever posture you can manage. As for the arrow coming out from the opposite side, either it may have something protruding outside or you might find a part of the arrow by touch above the skin nearby and see it sticking out.
Cut it open, making the cut as wide as you can bear to expose the bones. Then pull it out. If it gets stuck in bone, try turning your hand so that the arrow impacts on the bone and expands a bit, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for days until you can continue. If the arrow is still inside after its retrieval, push it back in if possible. If you have lost the retriever and want to use force instead, insert the expander tool into the tip of the fish's backbone and drive it forward through that hole.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with a tool that enters that hole; this makes removing the arrow easier. If the arrow has poison, you should cut away all of the flesh in which the poison was absorbed if possible, then treat it with what is suitable for this situation.
If the arrow is located in the chest or abdomen or bladder or flank, and if it is close to what can be severed with a scalpel, and if you are able to incise it, then make the incision and take care not to cut off any veins or nerves before removing it.
Then the wound stitch if needed, then treat until recovery occurs, picture of the calibers that attract the arrows:.
Its ends are nearly tubular like a bird's beak made to resemble a file if you grasp the arrow or something that was left unharmed. It can be made in various sizes, from large to small and medium, all of which depend on the size of the arrow, its weight, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Image of the hollow cannon:.
Image of the grooved cannon:.
This is like a groove at the end of the projectile, making it easier to enter into the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In the section of the veins.
The veins that were traditionally split within the body were thirty, of which there are twenty-one in the head, sixteen. The pulsating veins behind the two ears, known as the hisis (or hisis vein), and the two veins in the corners of the mouth, known as the shayban (or maxillary veins). Also, the two veins at the back of the eyes, known as nazar (or optic veins).
The central vein in the forehead, the vein in one end of the nose, and the two veins on the neck. The upper lip veins from the mouth, the lower lip veins, these are known as ghajar (or cheek) veins and the two veins under the tongue.
And if there are severed arteries in the arm and hand, they are five. One of them is the cephalic vein which comes from the anterior side and is commonly called the head and ochus artery, being a middle blood vessel made up of the basilic branch and a branch from the cephalic vein; it is generally known as body vein.
And the basilic vein, which comes from the posterior side and is also known as the axillary; it's generally called belly artery and arm cord. It's positioned on the zygodont and is the one that adheres and appears clearly above the wrist when seen from behind.
And this is the artery that's located between the elbow and the wrist, having two branches. In the leg and foot there are three arteries: one below the kneecap from the anterior side; the second, the calfed, its position being on the heel from the posterior side; and the third, the cissile, its location being behind the heel on the anterior side.
And in the other leg there are also three arteries like these. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is for relieving chronic discharges, colic pains and diarrhea, as well as chronic severe headaches. And how to relieve them will be explained.
And it involves shaving off the back of the skull and using a sharp blade to cut deeply into the place where the veins are. Then, strangle the person by tying a cloth around their neck until the veins become visible. You would then feel for their pulse under your finger. The places are behind the ears in the low points on the head; you can teach yourself through practice.
Then you take a sharp blade, known as the nasl, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the handle reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin above you and cut the vein along with the skin in small, neatly cut pieces, with each piece being approximately two inches long.
Or a method where you send the amount of blood you want, then tie them with ligatures and leave them until they heal. In the first book, cutting and tying were also mentioned. As for the two veins in the axillae, their ligation is beneficial for the chronic sister (or sibling) condition, hard headache, constant dizziness, and severe, continuous discharge to the eyes.
And how to ligate them as I describe, it tightens the elderly person's neck with a cloak until the veins become clearly visible and their pulsation becomes apparent under your finger. At that point, you learn by touch then lift the skin from above the vein up to its end using your index finger.
And the incision is made from below, lifting the vein upwards and treating it as you did with the other veins. You send out blood according to your need, then relieve the constriction of the elderly person and place your finger on the vein while holding it.
Then place a cotton and ligature on it, tightening it tightly from above until it heals. In the first book, you were mentioned to have done both cutting and treating (the veins), and also washing them. As for ligation of the frontal vein, its benefit is after the ligation of the temporal vein, for conditions like baldness, acne, and red spots on the face.
And the method of ligating it as I describe tightens the neck of the elderly person with a cloak until the vein becomes visible, then you take the tool known as the scalpel and this is its picture:.
And you place the resulting handle of the scalpel on the same vein, then strike from above with a comb or something else in that direction. You allow the blood to flow at the amount you want, then relieve the constriction of the elderly person and tighten him until he heals.
Opening with a broad incision is permissible, however, it should not be sharp like other cuts but rather slightly wide at the end and detailed for variation because the bone is close; thus, the forceps might break if it's too thin.
If we talk about the two eardrops located in the eye sockets, their benefits may help with illnesses such as measles, redness and discharge, as well as facial diseases. As for how to perform them, it is by having the patient stand on his head after tying a scarf around his neck, then separating these drops while you are standing at his head, making sure that the separation goes slightly longer in length using a small forceps that is slightly wide.
If there is no flesh in the spot, then if the forceps has a thin tip it might break. Then blood will flow and satisfy your need, and you put cotton on top of them and tighten them for one night, then release them. As for separating the nose eardrops, they are beneficial during severe fevers.
And the intense headache, and other facial diseases like red nose eruptions, especially if they are chronic. As for how to perform it, have the patient stand on his head and then hold his nose with your left hand while taking a narrow long forceps.
You insert it in the middle of the nostril between the nasal bones on a straight line because the eardrop does not exist there, blood flows from its place. It is necessary for you to hold your forceps slightly and release your need with blood flow, then bind him overnight as he digests quickly.
And as for the nasal conchae, their benefit is in separating them to ease breath and the beginning of leprosy and dark diseases that appear on the skin like black pus, boils, infected sores and ulcers. As for how to separate them, have the patient stand under it's neck with a belt around him and the operator standing at his head.
The reason is based on sitting down, then the sweat spreads to length, a wide but slight smear. Then remove as much blood as needed or according to your judgment of necessity for that, and do similarly with the other sweat. Then apply the ligature.
You should pull the sweat ducts moderately to prevent suffocation of the patient and leave him for tomorrow, as he will recover from the wound. As for the sweat glands in the armpit, it's beneficial to separate them after separating the axillary ducts because it benefits from removing the clefts in the mouth and decay of the gums and bad ulcers, as well as cracking of the lips and bad ulcers.
Those which are in the nose and around it, and how to separate them, that when the patient is standing in front of you, you pull his neck with a scarf then turn his lips and look at the two sweat ducts which you can see one on the right side of his lip and the other on the left. You will distinguish them by their darkness.
And also, there are small, dark sweat ducts around them; you should cut these in a jagged cut. If they confuse you and you're unsure about what they are, aim for cutting more of the larger one and show it to you. Similarly, do this with the two sweat glands located in the lower lip's area as well.
And as for the two sweat glands under the tongue, it's beneficial to separate them after separating the axillary ducts from the neck cavities that occur due to diseases of leprosy and mouth diseases. The process involves sitting in front of the patient with one foot on his knee light (sun boot), raising his tongue, looking under each side of his tongue for a gland and examining their color which should be dark.
You should separate these two sweat glands and take note, do not overdo cutting them. As there are arteries under them, it may result in bleeding from those arteries. For the three sweat ducts that are found on the axilla, this is the usual practice for all people, to separate them, which can be done on two faces.
Either by stitching with narrow fig-thorns or olive pits in the wound, or by incision with a small surgical knife, which is called "neshel" [and this is its depiction], the image of the narrow thorn-stitching instrument.
It will be as wide as you see, suitable for opening collapsed, full and raised pustules characterized by thick blood, like pus. And this is the image of the olive-stitching instrument:
This is the needle which has less width and sharper ends, suitable for pricking pustules with thin, watery blood. And this is the depiction of the instrument 'neshel'.
This is the 'neshel' which is used for incisions, and there are various types of it depending on the size of the wounds. As such, they vary from narrow to wider ones; this can be identified by its shape in other tools as well, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basalec, one of these three channels, its utility in making incisions is that it draws blood from the conditions located beneath the throat and neck, which lead to the chest and abdomen. The surgeon should be cautious when making incisions and ensure they are above his/her neck; if there's a vessel below him/her, and he/she goes wrong by adding to the stitches with the instrument, that can cut this vessel.
A bleeding occurs, thus it is necessary not to make incisions using the stitching instrument but with the 'neshel' incision tool. If the basalec doesn't show clearly, it should be avoided and another method should be preferred or a sample from its community sought.
Or in the place of an arm's rope if it is clearly visible, you should make the incision with a 'neshel' (type) of surgical knife as we have mentioned. If you want to make that specific incision, it would be advisable before pulling the arm to localize its position until one understands the pulse location and then practice on it with a metal tool.
Then the arm is tied and a cut is made along its length, as we described, so that when you pull on the ligature there's air inflation in the place where I instructed to use the needle. And if there is an inflation at the point of tension in the position I taught with the needle, then this inflation is due to the artery and avoid it.
If you see the blood flowing strongly when cutting, like urine from a child, and it is thin, red; then you should know that this is arterial blood. In that case, immediately take action, keep your finger on it for a long time, then remove it. If the blood flow stops significantly, it often stops completely. Tightly hold the arm.
Leave it, warn the patient against neglecting it and let him wear a neckbrace that does not move him for days until he recovers. If blood flow persists without stopping despite your presence, then if you see the artery, its ends will constrict and stop the blood flow.
Or take a thread, cut it and take half of it. Tie it tightly with the ligature and straps on the place where you are cutting, doing this every day until another day. If the blood flow stops, otherwise treat it according to what was mentioned earlier about placing the tightening points to stop bleeding. It's not difficult to cut his blood in most cases.
For a small wound where the ligature can be placed on the arm, inform him. As for the darker veins, it's beneficial to cut them so that they pull blood from above the head and below the body, because it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and branches of the cephalic as we said.
It is necessary for the surgeon to be on his neck from cutting, because there is a nerve below it; if he increases in tying the ligature and hits the nerve, pain occurred that makes him unable to see and perhaps it never heals. This nerve often shows up through touch.
If it is hidden in some people, being delicate and not visible, it would be necessary to make a cut on them that follows the natural lines and avoid the ridge of bones. If sweat is between two ridges, the advantage of making a long incision is beneficial, but for the sweat gland, the use of cutting allows drawing blood from the head.
And it benefits in eye diseases, and it would be necessary especially for this type of sweat if you wanted to expand;lt;expand;gt; by using the olive pincer or the broad thorn thistle pincer, because all veins are safest under it since there is no artery nor nerve underneath.
However, when making the cut, you should avoid hitting only the muscle head with the pincer and seek out a soft area. It might not harm him if he is struck in the first blow, but to be cut several times; however, it may swell in some people if they are not cut in the first blow.
But this tumor does not harm him in any way, as for the method of making the cut and its effects and what should progress in fixing it, first you need to know that making the cut is either done solely for preserving health.
And either it is used in diseases, which uses making the cut for preserving health and maintaining its continuity and preventing disease occurrence. It should be made in one of the three veins in the arm: sweat gland, bile duct, and basilic vein. And it should be done in the first pulse when signs of congestion appear.
The cut would be made on Sunday or Tuesday after spending three hours of day. As for the cut used in diseases, it doesn't have a limited time but can be done at night or day whenever necessity and need call for it.
In every hour and in every time, it should not be allowed to castrate boys until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should old men who have surpassed sixty years undergo castration. If anyone desires to perform castration for any reason.
It is necessary that he cleanse his gut before castration by a gentle injection if there is much stagnant feces, so as not to be attracted to the veins during castration from the gut, causing unpleasant inflammation that damages the main organs. It should not be performed on those who are bloated or diabetic or have colic until this disappears.
Also, caution is advised for castration also in cases of menstruation, vomiting, diarrhea, over-fertility, sex, fatigue, sports, staying awake and fasting, and everything that weakens physical or mental ability. Then look at the mixing process before that if the blood is thick.
With food, drink and medications if possible, then he should enter the bathhouse or resort to some sports in order to purify blood and make his castration during the day as we said. He should also refrain from all unpleasant mental symptoms throughout this day on his chest.
Like worries, anger, fear, and all physical symptoms such as fatigue, over-excitement, sex and the like, he should prepare his mind for matters that have become customary among people to use from varieties of pleasant things, scents, diversions and so forth each person according to what is feasible for him.
Then the castrator sits on a cushion which is higher than the one the castrate sits on, then he extends his arm and the castrator touches it with his hand two or three times. Then he tightens the ligature with the thong, doing this two or three times. The tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tension is not moderate, either by over-stretching which prevents blood flow or by relaxing also prevents blood flow. Then after the tension, it should be necessary to wipe his hands with two towels together.
Until the veins puff up and can be felt by touch, then the surgeon rubs his instrument with old oil. Next, he places his index finger of his left hand under the same vein as he wants to partially cut it, so that the vein doesn't bulge and avoids the blow. Because there are veins that you find like the ulnar nerve, which bulges when cut. And some of them are full of air. When the instrument is placed on it, it sinks under the instrument and deceives the surgeon so he doesn't open the vein. If he does open it, then his opening is narrow.
For this reason, the surgeon should be aware of these matters. Then, he should lower the instrument if the vein opens on its first attempt and otherwise repeat it slightly below or above the area with the wheel until the place doesn't swell.
If the incision swells or burns, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage. Perhaps it attracted a hot worm which might have caused fever, and don't take a bath. Then he may continue cutting if he wishes, as if the blade was inserted and the opening was small with a thin flow of blood.
And I feared that the amount of blood you want won't come out, so adjust the blade in the same hole it's on with straightness and increase a little bit in the opening. Do this adjustment using the wheel before the area swells up because many people do experience swelling at small openings during cutting.
If you see that it has swollen, do not operate on it immediately. It will not help you in any way; instead, place something from the extract of camphor on it. This helps to release blood flow and is better in this position than oil itself or other unguents.
Use camphor extract in all parts of your body for scabs when blood flow cannot occur, and it might help if the hot bath or the mustard poultice is applied to the spot; this allows blood to move and dissolve when it's thick.
If there is a large lump in the scab area, it often happens, especially for those who don't sweat much only that time or had a small opening of the skin. Act quickly, place a sponge soaked in warm water with a little salt on the lump and hold it for an hour; this will dissolve it.
You should do this after the blood has completely come out from its own sweat or from another sweat. If there remains something of blackness or greenness in that spot for a few days, it doesn't harm, and if you wish, apply some camphor and dissolved mercury to it.
Or something from the juice of foding and similar, often a lump and nodule occur under the scab of the bacillus, put your hand on it; if you find that it softens upon rubbing it, then this is bad nodule and be careful not to apply anything as we mentioned.
It may perhaps bleed from a blood vessel, and then you should bind it with what is in there to harden the spot. Then treat him with other treatments until he recovers. It's necessary for each person to have blood according to their strength and what appears prominent about the color of blood.
If the blood is black, let it bleed out until it turns red. Likewise, if it seems thick, make it flow until it thins. Even if it's sharp, let its sharpness diminish. It is desirable for someone who is full and strong needing to have a single release of blood.
One should widen the sweat pore and ensure the incision is wide, whereas for one who is weak, it's opposite; it's better to remove it in stages with a narrow hole. The best thing used to split the sweat pore is an engraved and polished groove without a corner.
This method of splitting is effective for bleeding and cutting nerves; it's reliable, straightforward and preferable to the split along length and width when performing surgery. It's advisable that if someone tends to faint during surgery, they should be fed a little of soaked bread in water mixed with date juice or saqjab (a type of honey) before the operation.
If it's a clean split and he bled him in three or four times, then if his temperament is cold, let him take before the operation soaked bread in a drink made of myrobalan wine or honey water mixed with fauwai (a type of spice) or a good mint tea.
If fainting occurs during surgery and its cause is excessive blood loss, it may be necessary to drink meat water and a mild mint tea. Gypsum tincture should be used for chest massage with it. All the methods mentioned in our section on fainting should be applied here as well.
The one who experiences discharge, whereas if someone wants to alleviate their arm and relieve their blood circulation again, it's necessary for the one whose split is for excessive discharge and their strength is weak that blood be released gradually according to their ability in consecutive days.
If someone wishes to relax his arm and relieve his blood, and he has a strong body, let him do this on the first cut of seven or nine hours. As for those who wish to draw blood from their body towards the opposite direction that it bent, they should expect relief in the second or third day.
And if there is much blood in his body that has heated up and become inflamed causing fever, it may be necessary for the blood to be expelled in one burst and a large quantity of it. You should widen the opening until you see the redness after making sure all conditions of the cut are met. And place your hand on their pulse while the blood is flowing so as not to cause death in that spot often, this happens when the surgeon lacks experience and makes a mistake, it should not happen if you wish to relax his arm and relieve his blood again.
And if the sweat gland's mouth has closed and it's hard for blood to come out, don't press on him too strongly or force it heavily. This is very bad. Either leave it until it opens again or tilt with the plunger what is congealed of blood in the sweat gland's mouth.
Or place on him something that has dissolved in water or something of the farsan or shahzunaya, and press gently on him until the blood comes out. If the sweat gland is swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch him until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for relieving his blood again and it's required, either do another incision above this spot or in the other arm or sweat gland.
And if it is a cut in the arm, he may substitute for the axillary and basilic veins if they are not present or hidden as they are composed of them. The method of making this cut involves having the operator immerse their hand in hot water until the vein turns red and the sweat gland becomes visible. Then apply pressure with the ligature slightly above him moderately tight.
Then the sweat is taken by a slight deviation, not for visibility or extension, let the opening be wide and have your incision slightly above the wrist joint. If blood does not come out, place your hand in the container of hot water and allow the blood to flow in the water.
Until it satisfies your need, if you are in summer days, you might be able to do without placing your hand in the hot water. More often than not, making blood flow in hot water is easier during winter time, and this type of sweat is safer than all other types. Because it does not contain harmful sweat or nerves, however, having the asilm (a type of sweat) from the right hand is beneficial for liver conditions and how to induce it involves pulling the wrist with a bracelet or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the sweat inflates.
Because it does not contain harmful sweat or nerves, however, having the asilm (a type of sweat) from the right hand is beneficial for liver conditions and how to induce it involves pulling the wrist with a bracelet or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the sweat inflates. It becomes very clear to the touch, then it can be further spread by a slight deviation. Even if you remove it completely, it will not harm him and be careful, do not overpress your fingers because there is a nerve under them, and the area is bare from the flesh. Then return your hand to hot water.
And let him make the blood flow in it, if you don't keep it in hot water, the blood will solidify in the sweat gland and stop flowing. Avoid this situation; when you remove it after the bleeding, according to your need, put oil and salt on the sweat gland so that it won't heal quickly.
And similarly, you should perform this with every narrow section. As for the benefit of inducing it from the left hand, it is beneficial for liver issues as well. Do this in the same way that you did with the second one. And as for Saffan's sweat, its benefit is for diseases located at the lower part of the body such as gynecological conditions.
Retention of urine and kidney diseases, as well as chronic sores on the thighs and legs and similar illnesses, including how to have a man immerse his leg in hot water and carry out rubbing until sweat is induced. Then tighten above the joint of the leg, with the sweat being placed at the heel area towards the base of the thumb.
And it branches out on the face of a person into many tributaries. If you expand your application to its widest branch or at the ankle where his feet meet, that would be better and more permissible. If you spread it over the face of a person, beware of harming the nerves under it on the face.
Have your excision so that it appears as if you are about to amputate him, making the surgeon's cut slanted downwards. If blood does not come out, have him immerse his leg in hot water and let the blood flow until it drains away. If the practitioner incorrectly causes perspiration at the first attempt of excision.
He should return the excision slightly above, as it is safe and there is no fear of coldness if precautions are taken against nerves like we said. The same applies to the other flap from the man's leg. As for women's perspiration, its location is as we have explained near the heel on the side of the foot.
The benefit of this kind of excision is to relieve the thigh pain if it's due to hot blood, and how to perform such an excision: having the patient enter the hot bath with the steamy vapor, quickly stretching his leg from the hip up towards the ankle using four fingers on a fine long glove. It can only be done this way.
If it appears, excise it on any condition. Either you keep it at the slant which is preferable or you amputate it or cut it with a cut. Its location is safe and in most people it's very subtle. If you can't find it.
For it is not evident at first, so I dissect some of their people. The one that appears on the back of the foot towards the thigh and shin, protecting nerves and vessels with a certain amount of blood which you desire.
Then, a ligature was applied to the location of the cut, and tightening the area, it would heal quickly.
The sixtieth and ninth chapter.
In bloodletting and how to use it.
The lancets for bloodletting could be made of metal, wood, copper or glass. Bloodletting has two forms: one is the traditional lancet method which involves bleeding and the other is bloodletting without a condition.
And this type of bloodletting without a specific condition, it has two aspects.
And the lancets for the inner elbows, they are both pages on each side of the neck. The lancet for the jaw is under the lower jaw in the mouth, the lancets for the shoulders, and the 'palm knuckles' lancet at the base of the tailbone, and the 'upper elbow' lancets which are in the middle of the arms, the lancets for the legs, and the 'pubis' lancets.
And bloodletting draws blood from the scattered capillaries in the flesh. Therefore, it is not necessary to sever what would be severed with a cut and bloodletting should not be performed, whether by fire or without heat, on any disease that leads to accumulation until the body expels all of its contents.
If the need for bloodletting arises due to illness or as a custom, we use it at every time in the first week and last week of each month and in the middle and any other time that occurs.
And there are people who, due to an excess of blood in their body, even need the removal of blood through bloodletting and they find heaviness and headache on their head. There are also those among them who find a fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck. Some have marks on their faces and cheeks, dark shadows under their eyes, and others have a blemish at the place of bloodletting.
And there are those among them who laugh excessively, and there are others who find the taste of blood in their mouth, they foam at the mouth, and their saliva turns red; some sleep more than usual, and see in their dreams blood, redness, injuries, surgeries, and things similar to that. Whenever we notice anything like this.
And especially if it's in the middle third of the month, we would order bloodletting after passing two or three hours into the day. As for the benefit of bloodletting by pinprick, it relieves heaviness on the head and excess water that can flow to the eyes.
However, it should be done after exhausting the body's energy. This bloodletting can replace fasting and one should beware not to use it on those with cold brains or those who have a cold (condition), as it can severely harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly or those who have cold illnesses in their head; it has led to forgetfulness for them.
Therefore, it is necessary to instruct the one performing bloodletting that their hand should slightly descend during the procedure in order to avoid causing forgetfulness, and as for jugular bloodletting, it replaces fasting on Khall and Pasil.
Therefore, it benefits from bronchial asthma and constriction of the airway, coughing and congestion, and there should be a slight elevation in the collarbone because if it became downwards, it would cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
And as for the jugular incisions, they benefit from sudden pains in the head, dizziness, fever, congestion, and discomfort at the roots of teeth; they are substitutes for a tracheotomy. It is necessary that the surgeon not deeply penetrate with his hand to avoid cutting through a blood vessel which could cause bleeding.
And as for the puncture haematoma, it benefits from toothaches and gum diseases and similar illnesses in the mouth. It can replace a tracheotomy that occurs between the lips. As for back haematomas, they benefit from pleurisy caused by congestion and fever.
And as for the inguinal abdominal suction, it benefits from a tracheotomy of the three major vessels (basilic, axillary, and cephalic veins) because it attracts blood from all those minute capillary vessels in the flesh. It also draws these minute capillaries from thicker ones until the attraction reaches the three large veins.
It is necessary that the surgeon not deeply penetrate with his hand because it's skin-covered and underneath are nerves and blood vessels. As for the patient who has had a colostomy, suction on the anus benefits from the stoma wounds and bottom rashes.
It is necessary that the surgeon ensures that the suction cup is large and made of metal, as the area requires a strong suction which might break glass suction cups and require deep cuts. As for calf suctioning, it significantly reduces swelling.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and relieves chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, bladder, promotes urine production, alleviates boils and nodules, replaces the function of the fallopian tubes and epididymis, yet it severely weakens the body and causes confusion among many people, the treatment for the epididymis has a close benefit to the bleeding of the legs.
The method for applying the pads is as follows: you first place the pad empty and absorb gently, but do not keep it in place too long. You quickly apply the pad and remove it immediately to allow the heat to evenly rise to the spot until you see that area has turned red and opened.
Redness from the blood appeared, and at that point you would moisten (the pad) slowly and reapply the moisture to the affected area. Then, you would observe the condition of the body: if it was rare for the meat to be thin and its pores were loose, then it is advisable to apply a single treatment without repetition so as not to irritate the affected area.
The instructions for applying the bleeding method are as follows: You should increase the time of application and slightly deepen it, doing so gently with a light movement. If there is thick blood in it, it is necessary to apply twice. In the first application, you open a way for the passage of blood and moisture. In the second application, you look for the extraction of the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, repeat the application a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a little blood, one application will suffice. If we want to remove much blood, we should increase the duration of the application. And if we judge that the blood is thick.
It is necessary to apply a deep application, but the moderate depth in the application should only reach the depth of the skin. It is not appropriate to use oils when placing pads and water, nor what concerns the person who applies bleeding, except for if one's skin is thick, hard, leathery with narrow pores.
In the places where baths were to be taken, it is necessary that they are rubbed with ointments that have open pores and have been finely ground. If it's during summer time, then it can be like almond oil or orange oil or sweet walnut oil or fig juice.
And if it's winter, then it can be like narcissus oil or apricot kernel oil or chamomile oil or onion and so on. If the purulent matter is thick and cold, then the ointment should be wormwood oil or nammam oil or bann oil or sparrow oil and so forth.
If the person undergoing bleeding has large pores, it is necessary to avoid rubbing with ointments. Those who do have excess perspiration should wash their baths after bleeding with rose water or cold water or grapevine water or fig juice or cucumber water and so forth. And for those whose blood is abundantly moist.
He should wash his baths with vinegar or water of asafetida and senna, etc. If the pus is thick then he should wash his baths with old wine or wormwood water or concoction of sparrow's oil or chamomile water, etc. One must beware of bleeding in the bathhouse and immediately after bathing.
However, it is necessary to use them an hour or two after leaving the bath. No one should take a nap after bleeding, and certain matters must not be done by the bleedee and fecal matter discharger before and after bleeding.
Firstly, one should consider whether the bleedee or fecal matter discharger is of a yellow type and has intense heat and inflammation. If so, they may benefit from cooling remedies such as ginger, cucumber, watercress, coriander, etc., and their diet should consist of thin broths, camel meat, and similar items.
Whoever has a cold disposition, it is advisable to drink honey water and mead or the wine of bazaar grapes. They should also consume fragrant medium wine which is between old and new style wines. He should be instructed to eat sparingly and make his food rabbit, pigeons and small birds. He should keep away from eggs of fowl in bad condition. During bloodletting and fasting, it would be advisable to drink more fluids than eating food.
It may be advisable in certain times for some people to drink strong ginger tea or apply musk or thyme oil before bloodletting and before fasting, or after it, to strengthen the main organs and purify the blood. It is not advisable for those who are abstaining from drinking.
As for the bloodletting procedures without a condition, these are those that are placed on the liver, gallbladder, breasts, abdomen and groin, as well as the kidney position. And above the knee, because these organs cannot bear to be pricked. Rather, they aim merely to draw blood from one organ to another.
Like placing the bloodletting tool on the breasts for the sake of healing, or we use it to relieve an organ from a cold breeze that may have irritated the organ like when placing the bloodletting tool on the abdomen and groin; they shake the organ and heat it up and alleviate pain through that cold breeze.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone in them, and with the force of drawing it might open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place. Likewise, when you place it on the liver and gallbladder in response to a chaotic breeze that exists between them. These bloodletting tools can be used only with an empty tube.
It can be used with fire and it can also be filled with steaming water for purposes of bleeding. This is because you fill the bloodletting tool to make it large in hot water alone, or with water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then it is placed filled at the site and held until it is removed, repeating this process as needed, and this is an illustration of a 'mamjama' which is used with fire.
The width of her mouth is two fingers spread out as depicted, and its depth measures half a span. There is a small hole about halfway down on the side, with an opening suitable for inserting needles; this is made from Chinese or yellow copper, having thick edges.
A flat, smooth surface is used to avoid injuring the organ when it is placed upon it. It has a thin slit in its center made of copper or iron for placing the candle on fire; this 'mamjama' can be large exceeding what we described or smaller depending on the illness.
We will use a candlestick, for the 'mamjamas' of infants and females are not suitable for men or older males. As to how this 'mamjama' is placed on fire in relation to the organ, you should light a wick made from tightly woven cotton or a small wax candle and place it at the center of the hardened penis which is inside the 'mamjama'.
So that the flame rises upwards towards below the 'mamjama', so as not to burn the urethra, then it should be placed on the organ and the finger is held over the hole mentioned until if we hold the 'mamjama' what we need was to remove the finger.
The steam exits through that hole and the 'mamjama' dissolves in place, then one should light the wick according to this method and redo it if needed. As for the 'mamjama' used for a disease with water, it does not have a hardened stick or hole.
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ alone, this is its image:.
This excerpt translates to: "This siphon, whenever it was large and could handle much water, was better.
The translation for this is: "Chapter seventy-nine.
In an explanation of the blockage.
The explanation (العلق) is only used in most cases in the organs where it's impossible to use siphons either due to their small size like the mouth, gums and such or because the organ is naked from flesh as with fingers, nose, etc.
And how to use it refers to the process of using water that is pure and free from diseases, then leaving it for a day and night in fresh water until it settles and nothing remains in its interior. Then, the body is first cleansed by vomiting or by bleeding, and then the affected organ is rubbed.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on. If it fills up, it falls off; if it can be covered with the siphon, this provides greater benefit; otherwise, wash the area with borax and then water abundantly, rubbing and squeezing. If the bleeding continued after the fall of the sputum and it was a dry cough, then soak a cotton wick in cold water.
Place it from above until the cough stops. If there is much blood, sprinkle it with a poultice or garlic juice or similar substances from the remedies to stop the bleeding; or put on the affected area half a squeezed lemon.
Leave it until the lemon sticks to the place, at which point the bleeding stops. Should you need to use sputum again, don't hang that sputum if another can be used. If sputum doesn't stick, rub the area with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle at the location until some blood emerges, then place it. If she feels something of blood, she sticks to her position. If you want to remove her, sprinkle her with something from patience, salt or ashes. She will fall off from her position.
The Third Door.
In Algebra.
This door also contains traps that one needs in the practice of medicine, specifically the algebra of fractions and the dissection of bones.
Know this, my sons, that many doctors and the common people would claim to understand this door, but they have never bothered to read through an old book on it or even read a single word from it.
For this reason, this art of knowledge in our country has become extinct and I have never encountered an expert who truly understands it. And it was only through my long reading of the early books and my diligence in understanding them that I was able to extract knowledge from them. Then, throughout my life, I adhered to practice and experience.
And in this door, I have outlined for you everything that encompasses my knowledge. And I developed my experience after presenting it to you, distilling it from the overuse of verbosity and reducing it to the extreme of brevity. I clarified it thoroughly and depicted many images of the machines used in it for you.
This is an increase in explanation as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no power but in Allah the Great.
The First Section.
In this section, we will neglect and summarize aspects of breaking bones, requiring their presentation. Before we start mentioning each broken or dislocated body part one by one, it is necessary to mention a few general statements and sections in the beginning of this chapter. It compels you firstly to understand them and appreciate their truthfulness, both you and anyone eager to learn this noble craft, unlike others.
And I say that if anyone experiences a fracture or dislocation or laceration or drop, it is necessary to first address fixing the break, managing any internal issues, or both. If there is no obstacle like weakness preventing it, or if what happened to him was something affecting a child or an old person, both genders, or if the time was extremely hot or cold.
Then, in his diet, he focuses on cold legumes, bird meat, and thin soups, avoiding drinks, thick meats, full meals, and any food that can fill the veins with blood until the tumor subsides and you do not anticipate a material gathering at the site.
And then, the patient should return to his usual treatment. When a broken bone is set with traction, it's necessary for the patient to eat foods that are nutritious and filling like lentils, rice, chickpeas, lentil beans, and beef bones. And eggs, tender fish, thick drinks and so on are good. By following this treatment, the healing of fractures happens faster and more efficiently. Remember, broken bones in elderly and strong men never heal naturally like they did before.
To dry their bones and harden them, it can connect what was bone of children's soft bones in the utmost tenderness. However, nature grows on broken bones from all directions like glue that sticks together and tightens them until they bind each other together.
They connect some to others until they reach the peak of strength and efficiency as was originally, so that nothing impedes his actions.
For this reason, the food for the patient should be foods that have strength, stickiness and hardness as we explained before. Be aware that fractures can vary in types according to the difference between body parts since a fracture of the leg bone is different from the fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the rib bone is different from the fracture of the back bone.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from each other. We will provide a detailed explanation of each type of fracture in its own separate chapter without overlap with others. Also, the type of bone fracture can also vary within itself.
Because it could be a crush fracture without fragments occurring, and his fracture could run along the bone to have fragments and clean or contaminated debris. The fracture could come with skin cuts and punctures. And there could also be a simple compression fracture.
Each type has its own special trick in correcting it, which will be explained separately in the appropriate place. What is understood by bone fractures are their deformations, dullness, appearance through touch and vibrations when you tap them with your hand.
If there is no apparent deformation or vibration, and you do not feel any discomfort when touching your bone, and if it doesn't bother you much when you feel pain, then there is likely no fracture. Instead, it might be a soft fracture or a slight compression fracture. It would not be appropriate to disturb this kind of injury by stretching or vibrating it forcefully.
However, carry out the medications that will be mentioned later according to where it's appropriate. Then gently pull on him with a mild strain. And know that if a bone is broken and squeezed by two things without the formation of fragments, yet each part has been removed from its owner.
You should promptly attend to his examination and correction before he develops a hot tumor. If he does develop one, let it be for several days until the heat of the tumor subsides then correct it in any way you can with consideration and ingenuity.
Know that immobilizing and setting it is easier with bone than when there are fragments involved, then move on to what will be mentioned, if the bone has fragments, you must extend the broken member from both sides, whether by hand or leg.
Either with your hands if the member is small, or with two ropes, or together with the rope and hand, make sure to place your member on a flat surface in its natural shape until the broken part of the bone extends. Then return those excesses to their places in any way you can using ingenuity and care.
Make sure that in your efforts, you do not cause any pain or discomfort to the patient. Strive to unite both bones with their companions as beautifully as possible. At this time, touch and manipulate them with your hands; if you notice anything out of place, correct and adjust it within your capability.
And be cautious of extreme pressure and strong pricking, as many ignorant people do. They often cause burns or temporary damage to the body, which I have seen them repeat multiple times.
Then, after the adjustment and mastery of the setting, immobilize that member with rest and heat regulation. Warn the patient to avoid moving it during their wakefulness and sleep, when they are agitated or restless, during bowel movements, and in all their actions. The aim is to ensure that no pain occurs when the body is in a position of safety.
And that is when he feels, upon placing his organ in a position of pain or discomfort, the desire to move it from this position to another where he does not feel pain and yet ensures that its position is level and straight.
So as not to cause deformity in the organ if forced, and regarding how to pull on the broken organ it's as I am describing to you. Know that broken organs vary in size and shape; what was smaller among them like the arm, fingers, tongs, etc., would make the job more challenging.
The bandages for the wound should be soft and not abrasive, whereas those that are rough like the thigh, back, and chest should have firm straps as the broad ligament needs to encase the larger organ uniformly from all sides with equal tension without causing it to stretch unevenly.
Then, after you have completed setting everything in place, you start applying the appropriate plaster. In a gentle stretch over the break area, then start wrapping the bandage around the exact spot of the break in three or four rounds depending on what organ it is and gently pull the bandage by your hand towards the upper part of the break area.
With a pull less than what you would apply to the broken area, then slightly spread your wraps from the break area and gradually relax the tension until it conforms correctly to the proper position. Then take another bandage and wrap it also around the broken area.
Then, wrap it down to the bottom of the break. Perform your pull and looseness actions as we described in wrapping the first one above. Place between the bandages a gentle stretch or a wound that suits the curvature of the break.
If there are deformities and otherwise, do not make anything on it, then wrap it with another bandage. Then apply the accurate parts of your dressing over this wrapping if there is no inflation or hot tumor in the member.
If there is inflation or a hot tumor, place something on it that calms the tumor and removes the inflation. Leave it for some days, then tighten the bandages at that time. Let the bandages be made of half canes polished and carved with wisdom, or let them be made of fir wood.
They are made from cedar, date palm leaves or strips of palm wood, and so on that is available. Each bandage should be as large in this shape and size.
Except for the bandage that is placed on the fracture itself, which should be a bit wider and thicker than other bandages. As for the length of the bandage, it is made according to what suits the size of the broken member whether large or small. The shape of the bandage:".
Then, tighten the bandages with another bandage according to your initial tightness. Then, tie it from above with tightly woven threads as we have mentioned about tightening; which is that you should tighten more on the place of fracture. The more far away it was from the fracture, the less tightness.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and softness, they should be made of wet camel wool especially. Because if the threads are too thick as what the ignorant people do, making them from rolled camel wool sheets, that is a huge mistake.
Because it causes over-tightness, and the soft threads do not allow you to reach the desired tightness. Also, there should not be less than a finger between bandages.
If the testicles are injured by the extremities of the penis in the correct places, make under them something soft or fluffy like cotton to prevent anything from harming him. And if there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and skin rupture occurs, we will address it separately.
And know that not every broken member should be bound with the ligatures from the first day, for if the member is large, it should not be subjected to ligature bindings until five days or seven or more depending on your concern about the occurrence of the hot tumor.
And this is the quality of the bandages that were used to fix the fractures, breaks and sutures. It's a general short bandage that fixes the break, suitable for most gels especially for babies and women since it doesn't get hot nor cold.
It is to take the dust of barley, which sticks to the walls of the millstone when the mill moves. Mix it as it is without washing it with egg white and make sure the mixture is neither too thick nor too thin then spread it.
It is another type of bandage that fixes fractures, dislocations and sutures. It's made from sheep wool, camel hair, mohair, horsehair, and a kind of clay called 'al-'ath' which costs ten dirhams each with an additional five dirhams for mercury, and twenty dirhams for Armenian or Roman soil. Everyone uses it and mixes it with water from 'al-'ath' or egg white if the sperm of the injured person is free-flowing. Then, this bandage is used; it's well composed, quickly fixes broken bones, and suits most people for its moderation.
Description of another dressing also useful for fractures and dislocations, it is taken from the first aid material and one-third of a dozen coins of each kind, five coins of Egyptian brass per each kind, six coins of Armenian clay per twenty coins. All are pounded finely and smoothly, then sifted and mixed with water or the white part of an egg, and used.
Description of a dressing for joints and bones that are dislocated from their places, which relieves excessive pain and fractures. It takes treated wool, which is dipped in vinegar and cooked oil and placed on the affected area. This dressing lacks the force of reduction.
However, it is excellent for calming the hot swelling and relieving pain. Description of another dressing that can reduce broken bones, take the pomegranate skin and wild strawberry leaves, pound them all together, and apply to two moist cloths with them. Another brief description of a dressing used in cases of bone breakage.
And you want to analyze the rest of the tumor, take from the white poppy and borage and lavender oil, pound all parts equally, mix them with the gum Arabic if the organ is not relaxed; if it's already relaxed, mix it with cucumber water or water and use it.
Description of another dressing, stronger for analysis than the first one, to be used when a hard tumor appears in cases of bone fracture. It is prepared from the root of white poppy, date seed, coriander and king's crown, rosemary leaves and lavender oil from each ingredient taken separately.
All are pounded and mixed with either water of cinnamon or pure water or gum, the choice depends on the temperature of the organ and its stability. As for Ecbatan, he did not mention in his book to apply it on the broken member when it is being reduced.
Only the cerate made from wax and oil, and nothing else, should be used. It must be of a medium consistency between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he thought that when setting broken parts with leverage, things that are dry should be placed on the broken member along with something hot like mint, honey, milk and similar to what we have mentioned.
A plaster recipe that helps with weakness and pain, it is made by gathering mint leaves, human hair or bird feathers, garlic and salt. It should be taken through pounding and sifting them before being mixed together and applied as a plaster. As for the amount of mixture to keep in the bandage.
Then you examine it: if there is no cause for the pain and the splinter isn't moving from its place after a long time, don't let him rest for too many days. If he experiences severe splinters or unbearable pain or swelling in that spot.
Act quickly to relieve him, don't delay this matter at all and remove the plaster. Then take a soft thread or a wet sea sponge, immerse it in warm water, wash the area with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, cover him with the matted wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose butter, bind it on for a night until the hot swelling subsides, reduces the puffiness of the limb, and relieves his pain. Then return to gentle traction and mild plaster without applying too much pressure.
Continue to treat him until he is cured. If I observe that the swelling, redness, pain and puffiness, as well as all other symptoms have completely disappeared and need a plaster and tension, renew it in the same way as before. If nothing of what we mentioned happens within the limb.
Do not treat it except after three days or four, or five, or seven, and sometimes it may be left for twenty days. All this depends on what you observe of the condition of the member as we said, even if the fracture requires proximity of the edges.
And increase in the traction more than your first effort, also increase in thickening of the diet according to what has been mentioned. If I see that the fracture site has dried and become soft more than it should, know that food cannot reach there.
And moisten it with lukewarm water every time you treat it, and do this every three days. Lightly reduce the tension a little; in such action, food moves towards the organ and heals quickly. As for what the fools do by using stimulants to break the member again after it has broken once.
For if it is not compelled as should be and it is compelled due to pain, then it is an error in their doing and a great deception. Even if it was correct once according to their books and they followed that method, I have not seen any effect from this at all among them. And the right thing is not to use it,.
The Second Chapter.
In the unilateral fracture in the head.
The types of unilateral fracture in the head are numerous, its forms vary and its causes are diverse. Some fractures occur due to a sword blow and they either cause complete healing of the bone up until the sphincter under the bone. Similarly, it occurs in wood as well,
Therefore, this type of fracture is called 'coming' and it may be that the sword cuts some parts of the bone and heals only one side of its edge without completing the cut. This type of fracture is then called 'cut in wood', and the wounds caused by these fractures can either be large or small.
This is a fracture that might be soft or hard, and its cause could be being hit by a stone or falling onto a stone or something similar. This type of fracture can either expose the tissue underneath the bone or occur in the surface of the bone itself.
These types of fractures can also either be large or small. There are also hidden fractures within the bone, occurring in hairline cracks, which involve a gradual break.
That's why this type of fracture is called 'hairline' fractures. It includes fractures resulting from falling or striking with a stone and such, which go inside the bone page and make the location become distorted; it can resemble gold if struck by a blow, causing part of it to penetrate inward.
This is more common in the wet bone head like those of infants. All these types of fractures can have either detached or not detached fragments, and we will provide treatment details for all of that in their respective sections. We will also identify all these types of fractures through examination.
It involves inspecting the fracture site with probes, removing decayed flesh from it. In hairline fractures, one can identify them by exposing and cleaning the bone, then rubbing it with ink; the fracture will show up as black. When treating a fracture, first look at its symptoms.
If I see symptoms that clearly indicate fear such as recurrent vomiting, extension and loss of consciousness, cessation of voice, fever, severe eye redness and darkening, and similar symptoms, do not attend to or treat the patient. Death will occur in most cases when these symptoms are present for sure.
And if you see symptoms that do not worry you and hope for his safety, then take him into treatment. For if the injured person was hit in the first moments of injury, especially during winter.
You should strive to remove the bone by the fourteenth day at least, and if it is in summer days, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day to avoid spoilage of what is under the bone from the membrane, thus exposing those symptoms which we described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is a comminuted fracture along with laceration, then it should be necessary to cut off the broken part of the fractured bone as described. This means that you should shave off the head of the fractured bone that is injured.
And expose the bone in any way that you can do it and according to the wound's shape and what appears on the injured person, if a bleeding or hot tumor is exposed when examined under the bone, then respond to it as necessary.
And that is to fill the site with a puncture soaked in wine and grease, and to clean the wound until the tumor subsides and bleeding stops. Then take measures for bone setting and removal. This can be done in two ways of action.
And the first way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow saw blade. This is how it appears:
Then you use another cut after this one, leaving a little more space from it. This is how it appears:.
Then you also use another cut that is further apart from the second one. It should be your duty to have various cuts, some of them being more spaced out than others and some of them being shorter than others, all having sharp edges. They should be made of Indian iron or good quality steel.
Use gentleness when striking the cut to avoid disturbing the head and causing injury. If the bone is strong and hard, it should be necessary to pierce around it before using your tool called non-submerged drills on the cuts. They are not submerged but called non-submerged drills.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the skull bone to beyond it, so that the hole has a straight line under his sharp head resembling a ring or small circle preventing him from drowning and crossing the thickness of the bone.
You should take several of these holes, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that every pierced skull has a tip of its sharpness in length and width according to the thickness of that skull. This shows three types. Among the holes, there is one large, medium, and small:
And as for the way of piercing around the broken bone, you should make the hole on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has pierced through, then move the hole to another place and leave a hardness or something like that between each hole.
Then cut with the cuts between each two holes, and do this as much as you can in tenderness as we said until the bone is broken either by your hand or by something else from some of the tools you prepared for this.
Like the saw and the gentle pliers. You should be extremely careful that no part of the skin is touched by the hole or cut. If you have worked on bone sticking to the skin, removed it, then it is necessary to clean.
And smooth the roughness left in the bone with another tool resembling a cut, but it should be finer and gentler than all other cuts. If there is still some small bones or fragments left, take them gently with any tools you have.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with the salves and ointments that are mentioned. As for the other side of the work, it is a simple one far from complications; Galen mentioned this and praised it highly. This is what he said. It is necessary for you first to start by exposing a part of the bone from the place where it was broken, and until you expose that part, you turn this segment of the eyeglass tool under it. And here's how it looks: .
The part of this tool that is smooth does not cut anything, while the sharp part has its edges in its length as you see, making the part that is smooth touch the cornea and one side of the head of the bone. Then you strike on the piece from one side only.
With a small mallet until all the bone is cut smoothly and gently as it turns, and you are safe from the peritoneum where no terrible accident occurs. Even if the surgeon is ignorant of people and cowardly, yes, even if he is indolent, even if he is tender.
If there is still something left of the bone attached to some parts of the bone membrane, scrape it off with the tip of the eyeglass segment itself and remove it gently. It removes it without harm or fear.
And if the bone break did not reach the membrane and what was cut from the bone ended at its face, leaving it rough and fine debris remaining, it is necessary to remove that roughness and take out those fragments with smooth scrapers of various sizes that you can use in every place according to what your work guides you to improve them as needed.
And the same broken bone and its shape, it is necessary to use first in scraping the bones a wider scrapers then you would proceed with finer ones. Continue doing this with loyalty until you reach using all your finest and most delicate scrapers.
And as for the finer, hairline fractures and gentle breaks, it is necessary to use a treatment for each one according to what leads to improvement, which is something that becomes obvious to those who have even the slightest knowledge in this field. Stop at what we wrote and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed during bone extraction, it is necessary to take a goat skin strip of the size of the wound and immerse it in wheat dyes. Then place this on the opening of the wound mouth. Next, take another leather strip which is bent or triangular. And dip it in a drink, oil and rose water, then place it on the first piece of leather. Do this as lightly as you can so that it does not weigh down the wound. Then use a wide bandage above it, but pull it only enough to just hold onto the wound.
Leave it treated with this remedy for one or two days until the hot lump settles, then release it and use afterwards the remedies you have available. Such as myrrh, gum of saffron, coriander seeds, black sesame seeds, etc., which involve making these remedies into pastes.
Apply the wound as it is dry, in short, use a medicine that has the effect of purging without being agreeable. Strive to ensure during your treatment that the wound remains clean and free from any greasiness or stickiness, do not let the pus accumulate inside.
Because if the pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it deteriorates and pollutes it. This leads to a great disease among the blind. And there is often inflammation in the forehead when exposed after bone extraction, especially if one neglects its treatment.
Black on its surface, if you look closely, it displays the symptoms that we mentioned; therefore, know that he is certainly blind. Even if the blackness was due to a medicine applied to him and this medicine had the power to cause such darkness.
You should take a part of honey and three parts of rose oil, beat them well together, then smear this mixture on a cloth and apply it to the wound. Then treat it with various remedies until it heals completely.
The Third Section.
In setting the nose if it is broken.
Know that the nose does not break except for its upper fissure, all of them or one of them, because they are bones. The lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not break; rather, it faces the bending, twisting and dislocation.
If one of its fissures breaks, it should be that the little finger enters the hole in the nose and you correct this fracture from inside with your ring finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and make sure there is no pain caused by your action on the innocent and any discomfort.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and your finger did not reach it, it should be corrected by touching the soft part in this point with a slightly rough tip. If the fracture is between both sides, do as mentioned, and let him correct its setting on the first day after the break.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot tumor subsides, then enter into the hole of the nose a thread from the catgut incision if the fracture is in one side, or two threads if the fracture is in both sides.
Make the thread slightly thick enough to fill the hole of the nose. Some surgeons from among the early ones suggested coating the thread with fat and replacing it every day, but I do not see that; rather, it should be coated in the white part of the egg mixed with a paste made from powdered galbanum.
Then leave the thread until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens. You may then introduce into the nose, instead of the thread, downy feathers from an eagle's wing after wrapping them in a soft incision to ensure that they bind more strongly against the fracture so as not to prevent the air flow in the patient.
This is not something obligatory if you choose to create it and if you choose to create the tail, then when there is exposure of the nose during your work and a hot flame falls upon it, you should cover the nose with quill feather or cotton dipped in honey and oil, or some ointment of spices.
If there is no exposure to a hot flame, it should be treated externally with the powder of millet and crushed saffron that has been mixed with egg white. Then place a soft thread on top, do not tie the nose to anything at all, if the nasal bones break they will break in small fractures.
Or if it disintegrated, you should cut open the wound and remove it with an instrument suitable for that purpose. Then stitch up the wound and treat it with ointments that promote healing and dryness. If there was a wound inside the nose, it should be treated with sutures and lead pipes can be used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
If the lower jaw breaks.
If the lower jaw breaks, and it was a break without injury, then if it's just a fracture from outside and hasn't broken into two parts but has been pushed inward, its identification becomes easier.
If it is a fracture in the right groove, you should enter the left hand's index finger into the recess of the lower jaw. Similarly, if there's a break in the left groove, enter the left hand's index finger and use the thumb to gently raise the fractured piece from inside to outside.
Your other hand controls from outside the bone, for guiding its repair. If the jaw has broken into two pieces, it should be mended on both sides until stability is achieved. If there was a break in the teeth, growth would occur.
Or divide it by tightening what you aimed for to remain with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place on the broken scalp zinc paste. Then put an inverted line on top and place a large, tight clasp or a piece of leather shoe equal in length to the scalp. Then, secure it from above according to what you find suitable and appropriate for its bonding until it does not break and command the patient to rest and avoid strain. Provide them with伊拉克's mild food. If you think that something has changed in his appearance, address its treatment on the third day.
Then, secure it from above according to what you find suitable and appropriate for its bonding until it does not break and command the patient to rest and avoid strain. Provide them with伊拉克's mild food. If you think that something has changed in his appearance, address its treatment on the third day. Then, repair the area after removing zinc paste with chalk powder or cornstarch and place a soft gauze pad on the dressing. As long as this dressing adheres to that spot without changing bone status, leave it undisturbed.
Don't fix it until it heals and the fracture strengthens significantly. This healing often occurs within three weeks. If a hot lump appears during this time, repeatedly use what we've instructed for stabilization until that lump disappears.
And if it is a fracture accompanied by an open wound, observe whether it has healed from the bone in pieces or fragments. Carefully remove these fragments with extraction that suits you for removal using tools; if the wound's opening is narrow, widen it with forceps to your needed extent.
And once these fragments are removed and there is nothing left, draw the wound's mouth if it is wide. Otherwise, place one of the ointments suitable for this. The wound heals until it has healed,
The Fifth Chapter.
In restoring fractures when they have been broken.
The femur bone breaks most commonly at the beginning of its shaft near the knee, and when it fractures, it does so on three different planes. It may break into two parts without creating fragments, which is easier to reset.
Alternatively, the fracture may involve fragments and this is more difficult to reset. Alternatively, the break may also occur with a wound; in such cases where there's no injury just to fracture, have two attendants prepare, one of whom will hold the broken bone while another extends the neck towards the other side.
Then, you correct the fracture with your fingers until it achieves the desired shape without any bumps or bruises. If you need to extend more, it is advisable to place under the affected elbow a ball of thread or wool.
You make the bone according to your need, stretch and elevate the femur, press the ball with your hand until the fracture achieves the desired state. If you cannot pull out a part of the femur, it being deep inside necessitates that the patient lie on his back.
You place a medium cushion under his knee and the attendant presses his knee downwards until the femur bone that is deep inside rises above. Then, you correct and set the fracture with your fingers when this happens.
If you feel that a fragment of the femur has broken off and is moving, it should be pricked and the fragment removed gently. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, it may be cut along one of the cuts you've prepared for this purpose. After making a device under the femur that holds the wound, which is an apparatus made of wood or iron. This is its depiction:.
The spoon you use is not designed for anything, its shape depends on the size of the bone you need from it as well as its smallness. As for its length, it depends also on what can help in your work. You should be two-tipped like this one, where each tip is wider than the other.
If the wound you made when removing a piece of bone is wide and sealed, suture both edges together. If the wound is narrow or if you're afraid it might become inflamed, split the wound open with more incisions and grafts according to how deep the cut is.
If you have a hot lump, start by applying oil and honey or wine on it, then place a load upon it. If the bone is affected but not from a wound or cut, treat it by applying a bandage made of dust from the ashes of charcoal together with the white part of an egg. Then place a soft load on him, then put the ball under his chest if necessary. Take an amulet that is extremely long and whose width is about one hand or so. Then carry a curved graft over the load and bandage, then take a hawthorn stick from a thin board. Its width should be three fingers and the same length as well. Insert it into the incision, then place that incision together with the hawthorn stick at the location on the amulet that corresponds to the breakage site. Then pull the amulet over the breakage area as you would rotate it. Hang it around his neck and under his chest, as well as the patient's chest. Push it back and forth on each side several times according to how I've seen that tension properly aligns the breakage firmly - something you should be able to observe yourself.
The entire process ensures that the hawthorn stick does not move off the broken bone. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the patient every day. Whenever you find that the ligament has relaxed and the kidney has moved, correct this by tightening the ligament. Then, have the patient lie on their back during sleep and place a small cushion under their elbow at night while sleeping.
Let his arm rise above him and the break in the dislocation should rise with it. Either raise his arm to his neck or tie it to his neck, do not loosen the ligament if no event such as a scratch or tumor occurs within twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see reason for it. Apply the tension and leave it until the dislocation is forced and becomes more complicated. It strengthens and gets better even more by the eighteenth day. And for some people, it may happen in less than that.
Chapter Six.
In forcing a shoulder dislocation. If the shoulder breaks in the open part of it, and its letters break off from it, when does it break? When it breaks from a place or breaks in its middle; this is known by touching, according to the shape of the break, so it's shaped like an 'm'.
Its correction and return to its natural shape in every way possible under your skill, then carry over dust of rhubarb with the whiteness of egg whites and soft oil, place on top of a pad made from folded parchment. Then put a wide kidney stone on it.
Make it as soft as the entire shoulder or slightly larger, if under the kidney stone it is rubbed in a place of the shoulder joint, then correct this rubbing with soft oil until the kidney stone settles on levelness. Then tighten from above with a long stole.
Strictly tighten the suture until it does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage relaxes, tighten it and smooth out the stitches if they have moved from their place. Let the patient lie on his correct side, with the elbow held in place for twenty.
One day or twenty-five days. Once this count is completed, the bandage can be removed as you are now safe. Bones are among those that do not fear breaking or weakening, if a fragment emerges from the bone and contracts under the skin, cut it open and remove it. And do what was mentioned regarding breaking the coagulation in calming down the hot tumor, if such a thing happens.
The Seventh Chapter.
In supporting the fracture of the chest.
The chest may break in the middle, which is somewhat uncommon. However, its ends are more prone to breaking and dispersing. Among its symptoms, if it breaks in the middle, it tends to lean downwards and exposes intense pain along with difficulty breathing and coughing.
Perhaps, there is blood vomiting and hemorrhaging can be seen in the broken bone. It becomes evident to touch. Support consists of having the patient lie on his back with a pillow between his arms, then flexing both legs. The ribs are gathered by hands from both sides, and it is smoothed out into its position wherever possible.
Agree until the shape of the bone returns to what is appropriate, then apply padding and weight. Place a companion board or a piece of horn or something similar underneath it for lightness after wrapping it in lacing. Then gently fasten it to the broken bone so that it doesn't come off. Pass the bandage around and back towards the spine several times, pulling tightly each time. Then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it relaxes, tighten it again.
And if necessity requires its solution when there is hunger, pain, or a lump, proceed with the solution and remove the bandage. Then correct what appeared through it according to its treatment method, then put back the bandage if I see fit for this. And bind him firmly until he recovers.
The eighth chapter.
In forcing the ribs when they break, you should know that fractures occur in the most prominent areas of the ribs, those following the back and its ends. The pain arises due to their fibrous nature. This knowledge is not hidden from touch perception during examination.
Forcing it by applying pressure with your fingers on the face that allows for evenness until the shape matches what should be, then bandage and immobilize the broken bone with a plaster if needed. If the rib fracture is tilted inward, it exposes the reason for severe pain.
Apply it like the cast that exposes one who has a boil, because the bone hardens the cover and also exposes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting large amounts of blood. This is difficult to treat. In its initial stages, many tricks have been applied there.
Among them, some say that the diet for those with boils should stimulate the production of air and wind to make the belly inflate and expand. This pushes the fracture outward. We dislike this because it may confirm the occurrence of hot tumors. If they did not occur, they increase in this condition and confirm themselves.
They say some of them would place a dough on the spot, then squeeze it hard; this is similar to measuring except that he fears the dough might be drawn in by suction due to his weakness. They also say that the area should be covered with cloth that had been dipped in hot oil.
And becomes a support between the ribs until it fills, then when it is wound around in a circle, it will become flat. Then treat the lesion with the treatment of removing food and medicine from the stomach, if overworking the lesion is an extreme thing that one cannot bear. And the bone would cause a distressing thinning of the diaphragm, and it worried us about the lesion; it would be better to cut through the position and expose the broken rib, then place an apparatus under him which preserves the thoracic cavity as described, and cut the bone gently and remove it.
And we close the wound if it is large with suturing, and dress it with ointments until it heals. If there appears a hot tumor during that period, proceed quickly to apply cooling aids, spread them on the affected area, and treat the lesion internally as well to soothe the tumor from within.
And he should lie on the side that relieves his sleep until it heals.
Chapter Nine.
In relieving the back and neck cramps.
If it is the neck bones that have been broken, and such injuries are rare but common among them, as well as the vertebral column fractures. When this happens to one of them and you want to determine whether they will recover or not. Look, if you see that his hands have relaxed and are numb, they have died, and he cannot move them, nor stretch them, nor clench them. If when you pinch or stick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and finds no pain in them, then know that he will hardly recover, for he is dead.
And if he moves them and feels something in them with the scythe blade and the plough, know that the spinal bone has passed and that the disease clears through treatment. If you encounter a backache like this and wish to determine whether it also clears up or not.
Then observe his legs. If you see that they have relaxed and something has happened to them like what happens to the hands, then when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out without volition, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out without volition. And if, when lying on his back and wanting to urinate, he is unable to do so, know that he's dying. Don't bother with his treatment. If nothing similar has occurred for him, the situation is lighter. The treatment in such a case would be to try to alleviate the hot tumor.
You should apply rose oil alone or with cooked testicles, on the affected area. Place this application three times during the day until the hot tumor calms down. Then carry a moistened absorbing pad to that spot and hold it there with a bandage. Command him to rest and make decisions.
And he should not sleep on the side that doesn't cause him pain until his condition improves. If there was a piece of bone or something that has been relieved during childbirth, it may be necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then gather the edges of the wound if it is large by stitching, then treat with ointments until he heals. If the last bone of the hip socket breaks, causing paralysis of the penis, it may be necessary to insert the index finger of the left hand into the socket.
And break the broken bone with the other hand as much as is possible and suitable for setting, then apply a pad or an ace to it if needed, and hold it in place.
If you feel a broken fragment inside it, then open it and extract the piece and treat the wound with previous treatments until it heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
In forcing the fracture of the thigh bone.
If the bones of the thighs break, if they do break, their breaking only means that they split at their ends and crack longitudinally and tilt towards the inside, exposing them to weakness and pain in the location. The affected leg becomes numb and insensitive.
And force it by passing your hand over it until you stand on the break as it is, to determine its shape. If the break only occurs at its ends, adjust that break according to what you prepare for adjustment until it resembles its natural form.
If the break is longitudinal or tilted towards the inside, place the affected person on their stomach until you prepare for the force of this break. Once it's adjusted, apply bandages to it then place a splint made from wood or skin and tighten it tightly.
Don't fear the movement of the break or removal of the splint, adjust the pressure from the bandages according to what fills it until the tension is taken off and you instruct the patient to sleep on their back or correct side, if he develops a hot lump.
Release from holding him and force it until the hot lump subsides, then carry him on what you have prepared as previously instructed. Then return to forcing and tightening him in accordance. If there are fragments or cracking of bone at the ends, it should not be extracted.
And does not touch but adjusts from the outside as we said, and leaves the tension until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In levering the fracture of the radius bone.
The elbow is the area between the shoulder blade and the shoulder. If it fractures, it can be set on two methods; one of which is to take a flexible, smooth stick that is proportionate in size for this situation:.
And attach two straps to its ends, then hang it from a high place. The patient should sit on a chair. Then, the broken arm is placed upon the stick until his elbow sticks in the middle of the curvature of the stick. Then, something heavy is hung above him.
Or have a servant extend it downwards, then the surgeon will correct the fracture with both hands until it returns to its natural position. Another method is for the patient to lie on his head and hang his hand from his neck by means of a strap.
Then you command the servants to adjust one of them holding above the fracture with his hands, and the other adjusts below it while stretching each one towards its own side. If you want more strength in the pull, you should tie a strap under the fracture and another on top, then stretch both servants towards their sides respectively.
If the fracture is close to one end of the arm, then it should be so that the center of the strap is under the elbow and the other part below the fracture towards the shoulder blade. Similarly, if the fracture is near the shoulder blade, then the strap should be at that location and on the shoulder blade itself.
Then, the fracture is corrected gently without force until the fracture settles to where it should and then adheres well. If no swelling appears and there's heat in the lump, continue tightening. If there is heat in the lump, leave off tightening for a week and cover it with gauze moistened with vinegar and apply rose oil.
Even if the tumor is located, then tighten it; a method of tightening involves carrying the dressing over the fracture first, then wrapping a new piece of cloth on top of the dressing. Then gather the arm onto itself and place her/his hand open on the buttock.
And carry the cloth and tightening on the elbow and arm, making the arm perform the role of the carpals (small bones in the wrist) if it is not prevented from that by a hinderer, and no change occurred to the broken bone. If you fear something will change with regard to this then use the carpals.
And it is to place on the fracture itself a carpel that is wider and stronger than all other carpal bones, and to make between every carpel an allowance of one finger. And let the length of the carpal bones be according to the fracture by adding three fingers from each side.
Then tighten on the carpal bones the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of this section.
And it is that your tightening on the fracture site should be more intense.
And the more distant the fracture is, the less should be your tightening. If you see how to place the carpal bones and tighten as we explained when setting your limb in position under pressure, then do so.
And if you fear the hot tumor, leave off from tightening and using carpal bones until the seventh day as we said. Then check on the ligament every three days to ensure no scar formation or swelling happens, nor is food prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening. All of this should be according to what we have mentioned.
And if you are assured that nothing of this will occur, do not release the ligament until many days have passed. The debilitated should lie on his back and place his hand on his stomach, and it should be placed under the elbow with a cushion filled with wool moderately placed underneath.
And inspect at all times during the day or night in order that neither the appearance of the broken member be distorted nor the ligament relax, and repair all this with your effort, let the food for the fasted person be to the level we recommended that should be mild first so that if bone is about to strain.
And increase his food, for it is customary for the shoulder and leg to strain in forty days at which point it should be relieved and use of the sauna employed along with remedies suitable for that condition, if it is a shameful and satisfactory fracture.
Do not relieve him of the ligament until fifty days or two months have passed,".
The second chapter.
In correcting the fracture of the arm.
The arm is made up of two bones and is called the zygos (or interdorsal) where one is smaller and it goes under the thumb, and the other is larger and placed underneath from below. Perhaps only the greater zygo would break or perhaps only the smaller one, and sometimes they might both break together.
When the smaller upper zygo breaks, correction is easier and healing occurs more quickly. If it's the lower zygo that breaks, then the fracture is bad and healing is difficult, especially if worse when both zygos break together. If it's the bone containing the smaller upper zygo that breaks.
When the doctor is correcting, he should make it gentle and easy for a short period until it smooths out. If it's the larger zygo that broke, then it should be made harder in correction. And if both zygos are broken, then the correction should be very strong.
It is necessary that the hand's shape during surgery be placed with spreading and extension of the hand on a cushion. The palm should be higher than all the fingers, and the wrist should be lower than the other fingers. The thumb should be placed in an upright position on itself.
Let the cushion be at its height so that the elbow doesn't bear any discomfort.
Then the attendant of the arm extends it from below either by hand or with a bandage, and another attendant extends it from above in the same manner. The doctor then smooths out the bone until he can return it to its best form possible; if there are fragments of the bone in a fracture, they should be removed.
Return every fragment to its place as much as you can; if a clean fragment appears and the skin is contracting there, without any intent for correction, cut it open and remove it according to the method described previously. If there's a fracture accompanied by a wound, I've provided a separate section for that.
Then treat the remedy from there. If you encounter a hot tumor in your first operation, apply to it an incision with a pungent tool made of rose oil and white beeswax. Make it medium between thick and thin cuts. Gently pull on this cut until the tumor subsides.
Then remove the pungent tool, apply a dressing made from kaolin powder and egg white. Carry out the clamps, let the clamp placed directly on the fracture be slightly wider but stronger. Remember that the number of arm clamps will usually be seven.
If the fracture is in one bone or both bones together, then make your pull on the fracture site stronger and more intense. Each time you pull upwards or downwards, let the pull be slightly curved as mentioned earlier in the first section of this chapter.
Let the incision that covers the fracture be moist and not too hard, but let it not be overly solid. And when you pull on the thread with a special type of wool in the middle of the sponginess and thickness, as we described, examine the member and ligaments after some days.
If something occurs that needs to be fixed like a rash appearing on the member, it should be rinsed with warm water until the rash disappears. Then, leave the member loose overnight for it to rest, and then continue pulling on it again afterwards.
If the pulling has relaxed and the bone has moved or something similar, fix all of that by exerting effort, and also check if food is unable to reach the member due to excessive pulling. In that case, loosen it a little bit and leave it for a few days until food can reach it again, then pull on it once more.
If nothing out of the ordinary has happened as we mentioned, then it should not be discharged before twenty days or so. Then, place the discharge in contact with its neck and let its arm hang down naturally. It must hold back its efforts from jarring movements and sleeps on its back.
And know that this fracture can be stabilized in the arm within thirty days, or sometimes within twenty-eight days. It might stabilize even after sixteen days; all depends on the conditions of the seasons and strength.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the stabilization of wrist and finger fractures.
Fractures of the wrist and finger joints are relatively rare, but the thumb is frequently affected. If the wrist or thumb breaks.
In order that the patient may lie on his back and have a chair before him for support.
Then he extends his hand to it, and the attendant straightens the broken bone until it properly aligns. Once it has sufficiently aligned, the doctor should apply a bandage and traction if no hot lump occurs. Then, a poultice is applied from above according to the location of the injury.
And I have included them in a soft splint; if the fracture goes downward towards the palmar side of the hand, make it into a half sphere with the splint and ask the patient to hold onto that by his broken hand using a long splint for tightening.
Let the poultice be made of soft skin so that it touches the skin even when all parts of the palm are bent, and tighten it according to what is necessary. If the fracture goes outward, then make the poultice from above and another one from below at the hand, making sure the hand is open and upright.
Then he carries the traction as if moving the hand, and ties between fingers with a bandage. If the fracture is across one of the phalanges, then let it be corrected to what is needed, but with the palm bent in combination with bending the wrist; if you want him to have a small standing poultice under him for supporting the fracture.
And do not move it if the fracture is across other fingers like the middle finger, ring finger or thumb or index finger; correct it and tie with the following correct finger or tie all of them to the wrist; this is better. Or place a small standing poultice under it.
As we said for the thumb, inspect while splinting and keep away from the hot lump; match it with what is needed whenever any of this happens repeatedly, according to his description.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the levering of breaking the thigh bone.
The thigh bone, being strong and prone to fracture due to its sensitivity to touch, often rotates forwards and backwards around the break. It can be treated by pulling it together: one should pull on a ligament above the break and another below it, with the patient lying face down.
Then each strap should be pulled to its side in balance with this action, if the break is in the middle of the bone. However, if it's near the start of the thigh bone, it would be better to pull a softer ligament either from wool or similar material.
At the start of the thigh bone towards the elbow, the pull should be upwards and the other strap downwards. Similarly, if the break is near the knee, the strap should also be close to the knee with a pull downwards. The doctor then corrects the bone using both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone is joined properly. When this happens, it should be immobilized with a bandage and pressure applied unless the injured part feels warm to the touch. If there's a warm lump, leave it for some days until the heat subsides from the hot lump, then return to treating it.
As for the pressure, it should be applied with a hard wide band multiple times - perhaps twice or thrice. What's left over should stay in place. Then apply the leg so that the heel is placed under the tendon and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below. The ends of the thread should stick out from both sides above.
Then adjust the leg and thigh where there's some left of the bandage. Then place on the thigh, directly over the break itself, splints, making one splint on the bone of the leg then stuff the gap between the thigh and leg with soft padding to ensure uniform pressure.
Then begin by pulling strongly from the center on the fracture site with three or four winds, and each time you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, your pull should be weaker, smoother, and more soothing.
Then, extend both ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and leg to where there are bones above. Then pass both ends of the thread downwards until it reaches the ankle, and pull the other ends of the bones with them from the opposite side as well.
So that the bandage does not move from its place, then keep pulling on it as long as there is no complaint about the member or tumor or swelling and so forth. If anything like this happens, take action promptly to resolve it and correct everything related to it according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a fragment inside the bone that causes it to collapse, it may be necessary to correct this if you can. Otherwise, split and extract it. Treat the wound in the manner previously described until it heals. This might strengthen the fracture of the thigh without adding bones from the leg's bones.
As we mentioned for the back and arm, except that supporting it this way does not cause a fracture, even if it is supported alone without including the leg's bones; there must inevitably be an eventual fracture of its owner.
And know that the thigh bone strengthens over fifty days, or more slightly, or less slightly, all of which varies according to different climates and other conditions.
The Fifteenth Chapter.
In the case of a fracture of the knee joint.
The knee joint is rarely affected by a fracture, yet it can be frequently affected during pregnancy. If it does get fractured, it either results in a crack or a loosening within its parts, and this occurs with injury as well as without injury.
He stands on all that by sense, and stabilizes it by making to come together what he has divided among its parts with fingers until they meet and adhere according to the capability of settling, care, and perfection. Then, he carries the bandage and bears upon it a rotating weight if it is required.
You pull from above the tension corresponding to that, then all conditions described in other fractures such as the hot tumor and similar ones meet each obstacle with what suits it until it heals.
The sixteenth chapter.
In correcting the fracture of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one is thick and called the thigh bone, and the other is thin and called the tibia. They are subject to various types of fracture like those found in the upper arm bone. That's why the treatment for a broken leg is similar to that of an arm, and they have one common approach. If both bones are broken, the leg will be dislocated in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the leg will buckle forward. And if only the thicker bone is broken and this happens from below, it's something you can't miss.
Use the pull, adjustment, and ligature according to this either way. However, if a leg fracture is extremely shattered with many pieces of debris, it should be less intense and lighter when pulling, apply your strength cautiously during the treatment.
In the leg, there is an additional aspect compared to the arm. If you have adjusted the bones and finished all your work, take two scents of juniper wood which are used in flattening chambers placed between the gaps of boards or they can be from palm leaf bundles or similar items.
Choose from it what is slightly rough and not made of leather, let its length be from the knee to the bottom. Then wrap each one with two strips of lashing on its length, put one strip along each leg and the other from the opposite side.
Let it extend from the knee to below the ankle. Then fasten the two femoral ligaments in three places at each end and the middle part of its ends; by doing this, you prevent the leg from bending left or right and from being twisted properly. A strip made of wood can be used along the length of the leg as an alternative.
It should be placed there to keep it from moving and you should do this more so if he has a special wound, then inspect the leg every day with great care for any swelling, puffiness or other signs of concern. If anything of this sort occurs, treat it with what is necessary until he recovers. The leg tends to swell during the first 30 days or so.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In the fracture of leg bones and fingers.
As for the heel, it does not undergo a simple fracture. However, leg bones can be broken and so can fingers, though it is rarer for fingers to break; in most cases, it's the toe that gets injured.
If a leg bone is broken and you see some bones are rubbing against each other, the patient should lie on their feet like a sheep standing up. You then step onto the raised area of those bones, press down on it, and smooth everything out.
So that it goes back to its place, then carry the bandage and the crutch above and put a small board under the sole of the foot with two flat ends. Then tighten the foot firmly with this support after wrapping around it with lashing and all else needed.
If it has passed through him for three or four days, then release the bandage. You will find that if the bones were broken or comminuted they are lying flat as you see them, and if some of his fingers have broken then force them and adjust them according to what I described for you in adjusting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, and make it slightly diverge. Then place under the foot this plate I described to you, and tighten it tightly. If two or three or more parts of the bone broke,
For each finger, make a splint of its capacity and place it in the groove of soft wood. Secure the plate under the foot, and let the head of each of my plates stick out from under the foot for good adjustment.
You should not forget to review all that we have told you about various fractures of the symptoms we mentioned, and respond to each symptom with what is appropriate.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the breaking of a woman's arm and the hardship it causes, and mentioning the man.
When the woman's leg breaks, make her sit cross-legged. Then lean her slightly towards her back and have her hold herself behind. Then place the cotton-covered part of her leg until it fills it up and becomes like a ball in her leg.
Then shake the woman gently to lift her slightly. This cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of her private area like a ball, and then the break in the bone returns. Then place a support on her back. If she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she can urinate.
It is sent in the manner it was initially introduced then returns to its first treatment, and you do this for seven days or approximately such a time period because it will be compelled, if you wish, to take a sheep bladder and tie it to her mouth with a tube and put the whole bladder into her vagina.
Then, inflate the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the vagina. The fracture will return then, wrap it with cotton and let it be for as many days as we have described until it heals. If a bone of the elbow in man or woman has fractured, use it to assist him/her back into place.
And the adjustment, as we described it for the thigh bone, you will not miss in these strange fractures that rarely occur, especially for those who are somewhat familiar with it. If one understands this writing correctly, indeed, the fracture itself indicates how to proceed most of the time.
To understand and correctly perform the task of assisting with fractures or pulling, take an ostrich's egg if it has broken for a man. Insert the male part into it then wrap it with a strip of leather; it should be fastened and left for three days or approximately such time until it heals.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In setting fractures if there is also an injury.
It is necessary for the one who faces a fracture with an injury, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or the shoulder blade or similar, to take prompt action and differentiate its time from his schedule according to the criteria of healing that we have provided.
If the injury bleeds, it is necessary to promptly cut it by rubbing it with powdered charcoal if there is nothing else at your disposal. Then take up setting the fracture on that day itself and do not delay it.
If no hot tumor occurs, if a hot tumor does occur leave it alone until the ninth day so that the hot tumor settles. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days definitely as it is prone to exhibit bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone, being exposed on the skin, requires a return and adjustment by your hands gently and slowly, if it does not allow its return and adjustment with your hands use this machine instead. This machine is made of iron having a length equal to seven fingers or eight. Display it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the doctor should take from it three or four according to what he needs for each type of fracture. They should be smooth but with a slight roughness so that they do not bend when rubbed during work.
And have its tip sharp and smooth on one side, with the upper part being rough and the lower half being extremely finer. This is how it looks:.
And in Greek, they call it a plexus tool for small defects. It should have a sharp and rounded tip at the end of the bone that results from the fracture, and push it with one go until the bone returns and settles somewhat. Then apply this correction so that each end of the fracture touches the other.
If its broken end is fragile and the machine does not take it properly, you should cut that bone tip until the machine can work on it. If you are unable to return the bone as described definitely, cut it according to similar cuts we mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the spreaders as much as you can, then smooth out the remaining roughness and scales in the bone. If after returning the bone, you find that it has caused intense pain, understand that the bone did not return to its natural position.
If you can restore it to its natural position, do so; this will greatly benefit the patient. When you have rested the bones, immerse a splinter in black, tight grip drink, especially during summer months. Do not place any wadding or oily substance on the wound.
To prevent the occurrence of mold and decay, then use splints while you are resting the bones. Leave the wound exposed by cutting a slit with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to pull the wound tightly with fracture; many uneducated doctors have done this, causing their patients either death or malformations. Let your pull be mild and different from that of other fractures, being as gentle as possible.
If the wound is bad or large and I fear some of the bad symptoms we described, especially if it causes pain in that spot, then you should not place splints on it. Instead, make him bandages out of hard splinters where you would put the splints and apply pressure with them.
If after one or two days you see that the wound has begun to start draining pus, remove the splinter he was treated with drink then use the ointments and dressings we usually apply to wounds such as the four ingredient ointment. It is necessary for you to loosen the bandage.
Inspect the wound in the morning and evening every day until it heals, and you should position the body so that pus can drain easily downwards. If the wound has been days without healing or without stopping drainage, know that there are small pieces of bone inside.
One must examine the wound with the probe, removing any stray fragments that are not clean and taking them out. If there are any remaining impurities that cause the organ to shrink and pain, it is necessary to cut them and extract them through all possible ways you can achieve this.
If the wound shows signs of infection, consumption, or any other form of decay and contamination, it is necessary to respond to each manifestation with a treatment that matches what has been prescribed in its chapter.
And you should remember when dealing with a large bone break and the impact on the body, like the thigh bone or back bone and similar major organs. Do not attempt to pull or remove them directly. Often, such occurrences can lead to death. Instead of trying to remove it immediately, let it fester. It might脱落 on its own after twenty or thirty days.
And when that happens, treat the wound if you see a place for treatment, and otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter Nineteen.
In treating the complication that occurs after some fractures.
Complications often occur after healing of fractures, especially near the joints. This can distort the appearance of the limb and may prevent it from functioning naturally.
Inspect and if the complication is soft, use remedies that constrict like myrrh, milk, vinegar, camel's dung, galls, and so on. Take some or all of these and mix them with a tightening drink, egg white, or lemon juice.
Apply it to the complication with effort, pull on it tightly and leave it in place for a long time without removing it. After that, remove it and repeat this process until the complication goes away, if God wills, or secure a sheet of lead onto it.
The property of lead is to remove all that corrodes in the organs, if a complication became stuck and worsened and necessity pushed for its removal, then cut into it from above and sever or strip off the resulting layer or some fragments until it disappears and heals the wound until it heals.
The Twenty-first Chapter.
In the treatment of fracture, if it became stubborn and after that the limb remained thin unlike its original texture.
If the bone fracture became stubborn and after that the limb remained thin and weak, then this can be due to various reasons. One of the reasons could be either excessive binding and tying them incorrectly, or over pulling causing food to not pass to the limb, or due to excessive self-abrasion or excessive movements out of their time, or lack of blood in the weak body.
Treating this involves nourishing the weak person and enriching their body so that there is an abundance of blood in it, using enemas, introducing joy to them and happiness, etc., then bearing with them on the limb for food to be abundant or for self-abrasion to continue with a wet cloth. Until the food starts passing properly and it returns to its natural shape, .
The Second Twenty-first Chapter.
In treating broken bones, if they became awkward and prevented functioning as it should.
When an issue arises with a member that has become stiff after healing, or if there is distortion or disfigurement due to the broken bone or complication, resulting in an altered appearance of the member. Except when the organ continues to perform its natural function, it is not necessary to accept claims that one should break an organ from its head. There are many ignorant doctors and those forced to do so who used to perform this in our country.
This action is highly condemned and leads to great deception. However, if the blockage and difficulty are intrinsic, it should be treated with water that has boiled with herbs like cannabis leaves, its root, royal thorn and so on.
It is treated with dried slippery leaves like tightly worked diakhil or the sap of cannabis root. It can also be taken and mixed with chicken fat, sperm from pigeons, and other medicines known as anti-congestion remedies.
The difficulty is resolved through constant gentle kneading using hands, and the movement of the organ to all directions at all times. If the curvature has occurred and become severe, causing obstruction, it's necessary to treat it with iron.
It should be cut above and the connection of the bone is released, cutting whatever has added to the difficulty or bones in slices. This needs care and effort in that process. Then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
The jaw is when a joint exits from its place, disrupting movement and altering the appearance of the organ. It causes severe pains and sufferings to the patient. If someone's jaw shows such symptoms, it should be promptly treated.
Don't delay in treatment, as delaying can cause swelling of the affected area which makes it harder to return the jaw. Therefore, one should not delay nor provoke or move the jaw while it's swollen because this often causes discomfort and severe pains to the patient.
However, if it is presented with this, one should immediately remove the pus-filled cavity and then leave until the tumor settles a little. Then, he should wet and apply oil to the member followed by gentle movement of each part. Each action must be performed according to its designated method as described in its place.
The chapters on dissection have also been arranged according to the order of fracture as it progresses from the top of the body to its bottom.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of the lower jaw dislocation.
The maxillae, unless they are very rare and removed, would come off on two possibilities: either they go away from their places gradually and relax for a while, or they detach completely until they relax. To about the chest until he starts to flow saliva uncontrollably and cannot hold it, or he can't endure to remove his jaw and his tongue starts to move due to talking. If the detachment is slight, then in most cases, it would return to its original state with ease.
And if the removal is complete, it should be quickly urged to return rapidly; there's no delay in that. The idea is for a person to hold onto the head servant of the patient and have the doctor insert one of his fingers into the root of the jaw inside the mouth if the jaw is from a single side.
Or all of his fingers if the jaw is from both sides, and the rest of his hand's fingers are outside guiding it. The doctor commands the patient to relax their jaw and release it towards every direction. The physician will smooth out the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
If the return is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use camphor in hot water and oil until the return becomes easier. Do not delay their return at all as we said. When they come back, settle them down and fit on them tools for prying with a rod made of beeswax and oil that has been combined.
Then gently tie it with a relaxation strap, and the patient should sleep on their back. Their head should be placed between two cushions so that they cannot move to the right or left. They are not allowed to chew anything; instead, their food should be in liquid form for easy digestion.
Until the pain goes away and his jaw tightens, he may eat what seems fit to him. He should use this with care and not exert force when eating or drinking or speaking so that his jaw might tighten and recover.
If the jaws are not returning properly sometimes and do not settle back to their original positions, this often leads to fevers and constant headaches. It might also cause bloating or nausea in some cases. If you notice these symptoms, understand that there is a fault present.
Often, if this condition occurs, one may die within ten days.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In returning the jaw of the lower incisor and the tip of the foot.
As for the lower incisor, it does not detach from the inner side of its connection to the chest. It might detach outwardly and be noticeable by touch. Its correction involves having the patient lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then, press the place with your palm firmly. If it returns, put a compress and tools on it and tighten them. As for its tip attached to the foot, it rarely detaches; if it does detach, it should return and align as what we have mentioned and is ready for you.
Then you place the bandage and supports, pull tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed. With this same treatment, if the foot which was turned also returns to its original position, then the disease will be cured by that treatment.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In the correction of inverted feet.
Know that the inverted foot can be corrected in three ways: one, it may correct itself downwards towards the ankle; secondly, it may correct itself upwards towards the chest and sometimes even above the foot, which is rare.
It does not correct itself towards the back of the shoulder blade, nor towards the front of the spine. It mostly corrects itself and moves downwards towards the ankle, especially in those with little flesh as it emerges quickly from them and reenters quickly.
As for those with abundant flesh, it is different in that he struggles to get out and struggles to go back in. It may happen that some people experience a blow or fall causing the foot to swell and become hot, leading them to believe that the inversion has occurred. It would be advisable to test its condition until one can confirm its health.
In this case, you proceed with its treatment. When you correct the inversion if it is downwards towards the ankle, when comparing between the inverted foot and the healthy one, you notice an apparent difference. You will find a bumpy head on the inverted foot and above the ankle when touched, there appears to be a head of the foot like a egg.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear or move it in all movements. Similarly, if the inversion is towards the chest or above, you will find this apparent upon touch, which is not hidden.
This dislocation can be easily restored if the bone is bent or if it involves a child, by having the servant lift his hand above then you place your index fingers under his elbow and raise the joint to its place with force while the servant lifts his hand up.
Then he lowers it down; then it returns quickly. If it doesn't return as we mentioned, and if the dislocation has occurred for many days, then the child should bathe in hot water and use a relaxant, such as boiling gooseberry leaves, fenugreek seeds, or using the crown of the king (likely refers to a type of herb).
Then the child lies on his back and a soft ball of wool is placed under his elbow, being moderately between softness and hardness. Then the doctor places himself behind the ball and holds the child's hand with his own to pull it down.
Then he pushes the ball with his leg, then it returns to its place. If you wish, you can return it this way: having a longer leg than the child, placing him aside and positioning your knee under the child's elbow, lifting his elbow up so that the child hangs in the air. And another servant pulls the child's hand down with his buttocks. If the child is light, it should be hung from something else to make him heavier, as this can cause the dislocation to return. It may also return in another way.
And it is to concentrate a long wooden stick, with its head round like the end of a bow, not too thick or too thin. It should be placed under the child's elbow after creating a small groove on the top part of the stick. The child stands along the entire length of the stick.
Then, he extends his hand from the other side and also extends his body in the same way with strength. Therefore, the joint returns to its place quickly; if it is difficult to return with all what we have mentioned, use this treatment which is taking a piece of wood whose length equals approximately two arms. And display it with four fingers, and make its ends as thick as an inch, so that it has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the elbow on this image.
Then, on the round head, he makes a soft scratch so that it won't harm the bare wood. Then, it is placed under the elbow and the whole hand along with the arm is lowered downwards. The piece of wood is then tied to the back part of the elbow and forearm, and finally onto the wrist.
Then, place the arm on a stand. Descend the hand downwards and leave the rest of the body suspended from the other side. Therefore, the joint enters its socket. When it has entered in any way possible, it is recommended to place an intermediate sized ball of wool under the elbow.
Then, he carries the prepared bandage with the dust of the camphor and the balsam on all of his thighs as if it was rotating from above. Then, he tugs on the ball firmly from under the knee, rotates the bandage over it from above, and hangs his hand around his neck.
He leaves not to move his hand for seven days. It should be recommended that the diet of the fasting person is light until the body strengthens as it is faster in recovery. After seven or five days, he begins training with movement. If it has been established and he does not relax, then he is healed.
If the joint keeps popping out repeatedly due to exposure to moisture or another cause, it may be necessary to use treatment with three types of wrapping as mentioned in the section on bandage treatment. If all of this was done and the bandage was removed after seven days, but the joint still does not stabilize.
Tied the bandage and strained it several times, but it didn't hold and dropped off. It relaxed and you couldn't lift it above (the injury). Know then that the nerve in the head of the limb has either been severed or extended or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never stay in its place.
And as for the jaw that is towards the chest and the pectoral region and to the back, it should be returned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns. All forms of bandaging and treatment are used in it until healing occurs. If there appears after recovery a solid mass in the body and movement becomes slower.
The wetting with hot water should be done repeatedly until that mass softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
In the treatment of the shoulder joint.
The shoulder joint separates and returns with difficulty, both in the direction of separation and also when returning. It separates towards all directions, especially forwards or backwards; it is not hidden from you because it is visible and palpable to what extent it dislocates.
And when you compare the dislocated shoulder to the correct position, it will reveal itself to you in an obvious manner through the palpation of the joint; it cannot bend its arm and it does not touch his hip with you. It is necessary that you quickly return the dislocation from your grasp before it presents a hot lump.
If it presents a hot lump, then it is difficult to return and may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is towards the back; this is the worst among all types of dislocations and it is more painful, causing death in many cases.
External traction if it is possible to allow the slave to extend both of his hands with both arms and the surgeon's hands from above and below the shoulder, pushing all fingers or the base of his palm until he returns to its place.
And if the jaw is to the front, it can return by bending the hand once until she hits the base of her bent palm that follows it. If the jaw does not return to its place, use extreme strong thrusting and that is having the arm extended by two.
The surgeon also holds the slave in both hands so that it doesn't move when extended, then swings the arm to every side after wrapping a folded cloth or wide piece of fabric around his hand. If the surgeon begins with his doctor's hands applying lubrication on them, this makes determining the position of the joint easier.
Then he pushes the joint with a strong push until it returns. After its return, it is necessary to apply a dressing containing grip and drying with egg white. He pulls the arm from around the neck of the slave tightly for several days.
Then if the joint has settled in its place, unbind it and leave him. If I see that the joint did not tighten at all, reapply the dressing and bandage and leave him for days until it tightens, then remove it. If he experiences discomfort after the return of the joint and its removal.
If it is difficult to move, then use lubrication in the bath and gentle rubbing and massage until it softens. Or you can make a loop from a fatty piece of leather for the joint, tie it on him for a day and night, then remove it and let him take the bath; when he sweats, cleanse the joint with an adequate scrub.
Then repeat the process for three times with the use of the bath until it becomes soft, and if you wish to make the meat of a cow moist and tender when combined with fat, rub it well. Do this several times; it will become soft and return to its original state.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of dislocating the shoulder.
The shoulder joint of the hand is often dislocated, and when it's reduced back in place, it does so more easily compared to other joints. However, it should be noted that you should speed up its reduction at the moment before it dislocates from its position or while it's being heated, as this can make the process easier.
When it comes to putting the shoulder back in place, you should have the patient lie on a table and extend their arm, while someone holds their hand. The doctor then places his hand on the joint's axis and pushes until he returns it to its original position. However, it is necessary to check if the dislocation has moved towards the inside of the hand.
The patient should place the back of their hand on the table during extension and repositioning. If the shoulder is protruding from the front side of the hand, they should place the bottom of their hand on the table so that the doctor's hand can be placed precisely at the joint's axis. If it returns immediately upon doing this, otherwise apply a soothing compress to any swelling.
Leave it alone and do not try again, for the shoulder can't withstand another attempt after a few days pass. The joint will remain in its new position without harm to the patient, unless the arm is relaxed and unable to grasp anything.
In that case, you will know that the nerve has been severed or it is irreparable. There's no solution but to apply pressure with your fingers; this might help or might not make any difference at all. Once the shoulder has been set back in place, wrap it with the compress described then have them hold it for five days while alternating between applying and removing it every day.
Then the hand is treated and exercised, if its movement fails and there is a part of the body exposed, it should be moistened with heated water and steam until it softens.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of unlocking fingers.
The fingers may break towards every direction. Whenever one breaks away from the palm or underside of your hand, extend the finger and push the break with your thumb until it returns. Then tie the tip of the finger and hang it towards the side where it broke off to.
Leave it for two days, then release and stretch it until its equilibrium is restored on the day of that practice. If this is during the night, tie it to the same method described, it will continue to heal in the day time, practicing movements with it at nights. Continue doing this for several days until it strengthens.
Likewise, do the same with it if it breaks towards the underside of your hand. Tie it in the direction of that side and perform on it the first method until it heals. Likewise, treat it this way whenever it breaks to other directions.
The thirtieth chapter.
In the treatment of breaking out (or protruding) of the back spine.
If a segment of the spine or neck protrudes, if it is complete, or if many segments have moved out of place, there is no treatment for this because death approaches quickly.
This is indicated by the urine of the dying person coming out involuntarily, he cannot hold it back and it often relaxes parts of his body either his legs or an arm or one of them. And if a segment has moved from its place, it often moves again.
The disappearance is to four directions, the one that disappears behind is called a boil, and as for its treatment, if the boil occurred during childhood, there's no cure in it nor from it ever being healed completely. As for the one that happened after a fall or hit and so on.
They have mentioned various aspects of treatment with long, often overly detailed words that do not always yield benefits. I have succinctly extracted what is sufficient from it, sparing much of the elaboration and explanation that they provided in their attempt to grasp the essence and clarify it for understanding.
I say that the boil which occurs in front of the chest has no cure or remedy for it, and similarly if it happens on both sides. Only those boils that happen in the back, especially when describing them like this, can be treated. The method is to cover the patient's face.
On a flat stand close to a wall, you spread out a wet mat under it so that it doesn't hurt his chest. Then place an upright board buried in the ground in a hole at one end of the stand towards his head, and another board towards his feet at the other end of the stand.
And a servant holds the board, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole. Another servant holds the other one in this manner. Then wrap it over the patient's chest and under his elbows with thin, tight cloths. Extend the cloth to the board at his head and tie him there.
Then, tie another cloth above his hips and knees, and around his ankles. Then gather all the straps together and secure them to the other board by his feet. Each servant ties their respective boards with the strap, ensuring neither of the two boards move from their designated positions.
Except that they are not documented as we said, and the doctor places his hands on the splint with force until it returns or he puts a board on it then leans on the board with his legs until it returns. If it does not return through this treatment, take a board whose length is about three arms.
And you dig in the wall that we said it should be near the urine outlet, a place where one end of the board enters. Then, he puts the middle part of the board on the opening (urine stream) and places his legs on the other end of the board. He pulls with great force until the splint presses against the prostate.
And it will return to its place. If you wish, you can make it using a rod that fits in the hand; by digging into the ground at the end of the urine passage near the head of the penis with two pieces of wood whose length is one arm's reach and also when at his feet at the end of the urine passage again with two more pieces of wood.
And let there be one hand's breadth between each piece of wood, and make a hole in each piece through which the rod will pass. Secure all pieces firmly in the ground so that they do not move. And enter this curved reed inside it; this is the tube where the band passes through the holes of the wooden pieces.
And at its end, there is a hole that contains a reed of one hand's length and it is curved. In the other two pieces of wood like this, then tighten the band that you tightened in the middle of the urine stream inside the rod near his head, and the bands that you tightened on his legs inside the rod near his feet.
Then, he stands by each rod with his hand on the curved reed that is inside it. The doctor makes the opening according to what we have provided. This is a diagram of the tube, the penis and the urine stream:
Then, after the pus discharges and it does not matter where the location is, it becomes necessary to carry the dried gauze with the whiteness of an egg yolk then to rub it, then to place above the gauze a pad that has a width of three fingers or approximately this size and whose length matches what fits in the cavity.
And on some correct nails, then it is tied with the bandage that should be used and mild food is utilized as a diet until he heals. If there are still some threads in the place after the final healing, then it becomes necessary to use medicines that relax and soothe while using the board which we have described for a long time.
And in this, you might use a lead plate. Threads may remain at the end of the back nails making one believe it is peeling; it is an excess bone that has become a nail and should not be exposed to this treatment as it might result in death.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the knee joint are only dislocated by fracture, not subjected to slight loss or buckling as other joints are. The hip joint can be dislocated on four aspects.
And that is, it dislocates inwards and outwards, forwards and backwards. It more commonly dislocates inwards than outwards. The sign of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the healthy leg to the diseased one, the latter appears longer.
And the knee is more curved than normal. The patient cannot bend their leg at the hip when they are in bed and there is a clear protrusion before this position where the thigh bone has reached that area.
The sign that indicates the jaw is projecting outward is when his symptoms are against these symptoms, and the sign that indicates the jaw is projecting forward is that he extends his leg to completion, but without bending it from pain in the knee; if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forward.
His urine is retained and his urethra is blocked, and when walking, he bends forward on the heel. The sign for which if the jaw is projected backwards, it doesn't extend the knee before the urethral blockage occurs, and his leg is also shorter than the other one.
The urethra is relaxed and the thigh head can be seen at the place where the spine starts, clearly. As for the return of this jaw type, if you observe that an old jaw has become attached to its owner without trying to return it and remains in its condition, there is no treatment for baldness.
It should not be allowed to happen, but if the jaw broke during a recent event and was one of any of the four types of jaws, prompt action should be taken to move the joint forward and backward inside and outside, moving it left and right. It might work in some cases.
He returned without needing any other treatment. If he didn't return like that, it should be accompanied by a strong servant who extends his leg from below either with his hands or with straps he ties around his leg above the knee for another servant to extend him from above.
It should be done by inserting his hands under his elbows, then pulling on a soft strap at the top of the thigh and holding one end of the strap for another servant. A third servant would extend him either from the front direction near the urethra to the backside (towards the abdomen), or from behind towards the backside (near the spine).
Each of them becomes exhausted once, until the pus rises from his body to the earth and remains hanging. This type of exhaustion is a common characteristic for all four types. If the jaw returns with what we said, or otherwise, then there must be specific treatment for each of the remedies I mentioned.
If his response is that the jaw has gone inwards, it should be laid on the correct side so that the pus drains down. Then two pieces of cotton should be placed at the base of the thigh bone between the top of the thigh and the place beneath the groin.
Then, the bandage is extended upwards from the groin area to above the body towards the buttocks. Then, another attendant holds up his arms and supports the thick part of the sick's thigh with both hands before extending it outward strongly. He then returns to its original position.
This type is easier than other treatment methods that require this member's response. If you were unable to get a reaction and the patient did not respond by entering into this kind of treatment at all, it should be advisable to bind both legs of the sick person with a strong thin bandage around the ankles and knees.
Each of his companions will be four fingers wide, and the sick leg should extend further than the others by two fingers. Then, he hangs the sick person on a wooden beam inside the house that is above the ground by the length of one arm.
Then, order a strong attendant to hold the thigh and another attendant holds onto the sick person. The other attendant who is holding the leg pushes forcefully towards his side, thus causing the joint to return to its place quickly. If his response is that the jaw has gone outwards.
The patient must lie on the pallet according to what we described in 'the owner of the purse' chapter. The belt should be especially tightened around his paralyzed leg and across his chest too. Then, two wooden planks are placed: one under his feet and the other at his head. A piece of wood is also added centrally on the pallet being fastened very strongly.
She has been wrapped with a damp cloth so as not to harm the paralyzed, and there is wood between her thighs in order not to be drawn down when she swells. Then each attendant extends himself towards his side while the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands, should he move back towards normalcy.
Otherwise, place the board and secure it as described in 'the owner of the purse', whether or not he should lie on his side correctly. If standing, he must extend his leg once while lying flat according to this description on the pallet.
The doctor places his right hand on the paralyzed thigh and presses it with another hand, yet he makes the pressure extend downward towards the knee. If standing behind, it is not proper for the paralyzed to bend down.
He should be elevated on the ground, but it's preferable to place him on something hard. Also, his elbows and knees should stick outwards as described in his lying down on the pallet with him facing forward; the belts are tightened.
As we've said earlier, it's necessary to use the board on the place where the joint has moved. If the hip returns as it should and its indication becomes apparent to you, which is that the paralyzed leg extends.
If you see them at the same level and when pressing, the leg grips and extends without any difficulty, know that he has returned the limb to what it should be. Then align the thighs, carry the dressing, and pull with extreme force on the straps so that the hip does not move from side to side.
The patient must wear the ligature. Three or four days later, remove the bandage and apply to one leg what was applied to the other. If you see them at the same level equally, know that the fracture has healed, and allow the patient to walk by releasing the ligature. If you observe any sign of relaxation in it.
Return and reapply the dressing, pulling it as you did first, then leave it for three days. After that, remove it and allow walking on it gradually until it strengthens well, if God wills.
The Second and Third Chapters.
In treating dislocation of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three directions: it dislocates inward, outward, and downward, meaning behind. It dislocates not forward of the patella. The sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to bend his leg towards his shin.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. And apply all means of correction: Have the patient sit down and extend his legs if he can bear it, sitting behind him to hold him in place and gently pull him backward a little bit. Then sit on his shins.
You should have your back to his face, placing one leg between yours. Then immobilize the knee with both hands and tie them between your fingers on top of the knee. Then press each side of the knee hard with your hands while another attendant extends their leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign that it is regressing is when the leg sticks to the thigh in a soft manner which is not forbidden, then tighten them and stick the leg to the thigh again, then bind both of them with an arm band for three or four days, then release them. It should only be used for slight walking until they strengthen.
If returning it to you as described fails, then use the strong stretching with the bands that I have described in treating the hip until it returns.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of breaking the arch.
The heel may come off gradually or completely. The breaking of the heel can either be towards inside or outside, and a sign that it has broken is to see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction it broke towards.
As for the treatment of its loss, it is easier to return it. You can gently guide it with your hands until it returns to its original position. However, if it breaks completely, you should sit the patient down and have a strong servant hold his hands firmly from behind in the middle of his back.
Then, with your right hand hold the leg from its top and with your left hand from below it at the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, two times in succession. Extend it with your left hand, push the chest of the foot towards the thigh without violence.
This is done twice as we described, then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh in the third time while pulling at the ankle. If it returns once or twice in this manner and you see that the foot is level, otherwise redo the operation on her because she will return.
If return to you as described, otherwise I will lie the patient on his back on the ground and pin him, dig in the earth with a deep peg so that it falls between his thighs. Having tied him up without harming the patient, then adjust his slave leg.
Then another servant holds the man's legs either with his hands or with a girth that binds him around his neck. Then each servant stands opposite the other, and their ankles are between the thighs of the patient, holding it to prevent his body from sagging downwards during stretching. Lastly, the doctor straightens the jaws using his hands.
And another servant holds the correct leg downwards. The jaw returns quickly, if it returns and you see that it is healthy, take the gauze and pressure, tighten it with tight straps, and place the foot behind the strap downwards. It is advisable to avoid the nerve above the heel from behind.
So that the strap doesn't hurt him, leave it for two or three days. If the strap relaxes, tighten it again then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If he tries to walk before this period, it is not safe that his jaw breaks and becomes damaged. He will no longer accept treatment after that. If such a condition occurs where there's inflammation, you should apply what we previously described in another treatment context and pressing until it subsides.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In treating dislocated fingers of the hand.
It is necessary to gently restore what has dislocated from it with a short, gentle stretch. This is not difficult but rather easy. If the jaw was in some sections of the foot, you should make the patient place his foot on a level ground.
On a table, while standing like a sheep, then proceed you to place your foot on the part of those joints as we have indicated and press it with your foot strongly until it returns and you see that it has corrected itself without showing a deviation in its position.
Then make him a board under the sole of his foot, so that all his foot can be on it and have two ends. Then, pull it tightly for three days with a strong and tight tension. Afterwards, let it relax and keep him off walking for many days until it strengthens enough to allow safe return if God wills.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the various types of fracture that occurs with injury or breakage, or both.
If such a thing happens and you apply its treatment and plastering excessively, it often leads to death.
For this reason, it should not be treated with such a method except by someone who is prudent in craftsmanship, long-sighted, tenderhearted, thoughtful, sober and cautious. They should initially use only the medications that calm hot swellings and entrust themselves to the divine will.
Let fate determine, Lord, anything other than what I hoped for safety from the disease with light illness and in him you showed some hope; then, reject its response by your mercy at first before an actual hot tumor appears.
If the member returns as desired, then use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treat the injury with what is suitable from dried ointments. If the fracture involved bone fragments that were cleansed of impurities, remove them. And adhere to what we mentioned in simple diseases as provided for in their respective places.
Exert your effort and cleanse yourself of entering the way of pitfalls as you have progressed and instructed me, so that shall remain beneficial for you and protect your appearance if Allah wills.
