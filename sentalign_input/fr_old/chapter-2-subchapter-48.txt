Of abscesses of the armpits
These abscesses that come under the armpits are types of hard scrofula with sacs, and some contain moisture.
Those that contain moisture must be cut in this form, from line b. to line g.:
And when all the pus in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess resembles scrofula, cut it as we have said for scrofula incisions, and if the wound discharges pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
