Chapter Fifty:
On the cauterization for cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its perimeter.
Wise men say it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center, but I have not seen this done, as I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen this happen sometimes.
It is better to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
