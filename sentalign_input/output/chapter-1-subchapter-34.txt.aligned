On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.	On cauterization for anal haemorrhoids.	0.71377736
When old hemorrhoids are present, or there are thick, cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated as previously described without success, then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower vertebrae of the small triangular back, and one cauterization above the navel, two finger-widths apart.	When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.	0.8264862
If you suspect that the patient's stomach is cold and the food is not digested, and their face appears swollen, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; also cauterize once on the liver, and once on the spleen with a nail-like cautery, leaving the cauterized area open for a while, and treat it until it is healed.	And if you consider that his stomach has become chilled and his food not being digested, and you see his face swollen, then do one big cauterization over the stomach as previously described; and one over his liver; and another over the spleen; with the claviform cautery. Keep the burn open a long while; then dress till healed.	0.8594472
