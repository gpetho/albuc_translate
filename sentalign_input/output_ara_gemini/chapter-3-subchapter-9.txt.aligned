And if he moves them and feels the pinch and the pricking in them, then know that the bone marrow is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.	But if he moves them both and feels in them the pinching and pricking, you may know that the spinal medulla is still intact and that under treatment the patient will recover.	0.7869345
If something similar happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether he will also recover or not, look at his legs.  If you see that they have become limp and what happened to the hands has also happened to them, then if he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not bother with his treatment.	If anything of this nature happens to the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if he will recover or not, then pay attention to his feet. If you see them relaxed and in the situation we described in the case of the hands, and when he lies on his back he passes flatus and faeces involuntarily, and lying prone he passes water involuntarily and lying on his back he cannot pass water if he wishes, then you may know his case is hopeless, so do not concern yourself with his treatment.	0.8824922
If none of this happens to him, the matter is less severe.	But if nothing of this kind occur then the case is easier.	0.6840937
And the treatment for what happened is that you try to soothe the hot swelling by placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg whites, on the bruised vertebra.  Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying bandages and tighten it with a bandage. Order him to rest and stay still, and not to sleep except on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers.	The way to treat this latter kind of case is to try to reduce the swelling by applying over the injured vertebra oil of roses, alone, or with roasted yolks of egg; apply three times a day until the swelling has gone down. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening and absorbent plasters and bind it on; bid him keep quiet and still and sleep only in the attitude in which he has no pain, until he is well.	0.9046794
If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone during the bruise, from which pus has come out, then it is necessary to cut the skin over it and extract that bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together, if it is large, with stitching, then treat it with healing ointments until it recovers.	If the injury is accompanied by fragmentation or a separation of part of the bone, you must cut down on it and remove the bone; then bring together the edges of the opening, by suture if it be wide; then treat with granulating ointments until it heals.	0.79793495
If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus and straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and as straightening allows. Then apply a bandage and a splint if needed, and then tighten it.	If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the sacrum of the tail, breaks, introduce the thumb of your left hand into his anus and reset the bone with the other hand in whatever way is possible and affords the best setting; then apply over it a plaster, and a splint if necessary, and bind it up.	0.9199253
If you feel a broken splinter in it, cut over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the treatment mentioned previously until it heals.	And if you perceive a fragment in the fracture, cut down upon it, remove it, and dress the wound as before said, until it heals.	0.8293625
