of the fracture of the chest
The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks further down.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hollow appears in the broken bone, and one can feel it clearly.
And the restoration is such that the patient often lies on his back, and you place a cushion between the shoulder blades, then press on the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of both sides with your hands, and strive to put them evenly in all the ways you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be; then place plasters and padding on a thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it suitably, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it; and if it needs to be undone, because of infection or itching that comes to the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and undo it, and remove the plaster, and address whatever has developed there in terms of treatment; then replace the plaster, and tighten it until he is healed.
