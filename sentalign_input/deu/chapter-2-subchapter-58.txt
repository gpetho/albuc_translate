Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is caused by an obstruction from a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or flesh, similar to what we have discussed in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not dissolved, and you see that the retention is due to a stone in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees.
Then place their feet on their back and stretch their belly from the upper part of their back, and the patient should strain their groin as much as possible.
Then the neck of the bladder is constricted, expelling the stone to the back parts, and the urine is released.
And if the urine is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has the following shape: It should be made of silver, thin, concave, like a birdâ€™s quill with a fine long ray similar to a palm and a half in length, with a thin tube at its tip.
And the method for releasing urine with this is to take double bile and tie wool or cotton at its end for a good binding; insert the ends of the bile into the lower part of the syringe, and cut any excess wool with scissors, then insert it into the tube with force. Then wet the syringe with water and egg white.
Have the patient sit on a chair, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and rose water.
Then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the penis; fold the penis upwards towards the navel; push the syringe into it; and push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reaching the empty area, not following this order, but in a winding path.
Then extend the bile with the wool little by little, as the urine soaks into the wool.
Then extract it and make urine flow for treatment, using the syringe; continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
