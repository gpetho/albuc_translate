Chapter sixty-five on the treatment of intestinal strangury.
The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the soft parts of the abdomen, so the intestine pours from that rupture to one of the two testicles, and this rupture can be either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and so on.
And its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long period, and it does not happen suddenly, and the swelling will be level towards the depth because the peritoneum squeezes the intestine.
And its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning it causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling will be distinct, appearing under the skin nearby, and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its passage outside the peritoneum.
And the omentum might come out with the intestine, so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it may be with flatulence.
And excrement might run in the intestine and be trapped there, so with it comes the demise of the patient because it causes difficult pain and rumbling, especially if squeezed.
And the treatment of these types of illness with iron is dangerous, so one should beware of falling into it.
The method of operation is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand to inside his cavity, if it is possible to return, then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the testicle lengthwise, then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision as much as needed to open the incision with them, and the incision should be as much as the testicle can come out of.
Then you peel the peritoneal layers that are under the skin of the testicle until the hard white peritoneum is exposed from all sides, then insert your index finger next to the testicle between the white peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle and between the second peritoneum, and release with it the adhesion that is behind the testicle.
Then you bend with the right hand to inside the skin of the testicle, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand, and you raise the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision, and you order the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you release the adhesion that is behind completely, and you search with your finger so that there is nothing of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum, and if you find something of it, push it to the lower abdomen.
Then you take a needle with a thick thread that has been twisted from ten threads, and you insert it at the end of the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle next to the incision, then you cut the ends of the folded thread until there are four threads, then you assemble them on top of each other in a hardened form, and you tie with them the peritoneum that we said is under the skin of the testicle with a tight knot from two sides, then you also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish it can reach it, so that no hot swelling occurs from that, and also make a second knot outside the first knot, less than two fingers away from it, and after these two knots you leave from the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle the size of a finger bone, and you cut all the rest in a circular shape and remove the testicle with it.
Then you incise below the skin of the testicle an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously.
Then wool dipped in oil is used and placed in the wound, and the bandage that we described is used.
And the white peritoneum that we mentioned may be cauterized after cutting it, as a precaution against bleeding, as this often happens.
And you leave the bandage until it falls off on its own, and if its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water and something that makes him sweat should be applied to him until it falls off, then the wound is treated with all other wound treatments until it heals.
