When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery, which is called "olivare". (or "olive-shaped")	When an eyelid droops either from disease or humidity, then burn the lid with a single cauterization with this crescent-shaped cautery.	0.5655012
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not remove the hand until a third of the eyelid is burned, in the manner I have described.	And if you wish burn him also a little above the eyebrows with two cauterizations (; that is, one) on each side; but keep clear of the temples; and let each cauterization be of the length of the eyebrow. Nor let your hand apply the cautery longer than to burn a third of the way through the skin.	0.75042534
