Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the openings of their ears unperforated.
Blockage may also occur in some people in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh growing in it, and this blockage may be deep in the ear canal, imperceptible to sight.
It may also occur a little outside the opening and be perceptible to sight. The one that occurs deep in the ear and is imperceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to treat. As for the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun.
And look into it. If you see the blockage apparent, open it with a delicate scalpel, the image of which is this:.
Its tip should have some slight width, somewhat restricted, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you sense the blockage along with the heaviness of hearing that the patient experiences, pierce it gently.
And beware of injuring the eardrum. Then insert a wick into the ear, the size of the opening, having smeared it with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are certain the wound will not close.  Or take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
And use it.  If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have smeared with a cerate made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use all the other treatments that stop bleeding, which are mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.
