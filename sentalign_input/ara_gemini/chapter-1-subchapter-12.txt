The twelfth chapter on cauterizing the water descending into the eye.
If the beginning of the descending water in the eye is clear to you by the signs that were mentioned in the classification, then hasten to give the sick person what purifies his head, and protect him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for days.
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head.
Then cauterize him with two cauteries on the temples if the beginning of the descent of the water is in both eyes, or from one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cauteries be long across the width of the temples, and beware of bleeding, so if you see any of it, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will come to the wisdom in stripping the arteries and cutting them and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized on the nape of the neck under the two bones with two deep cauteries.
