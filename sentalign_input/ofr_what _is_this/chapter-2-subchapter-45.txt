of the knots/nodes
There are many kinds of knots/nodes, of which I will describe all the appearances; and now I must explain all the differences between a knot/node and a growth/protrusion. 
I say that a growth/protrusion involves heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is over, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a knot/node, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is the same color as the body, and it begins like a speck and grows large; and they are of two types, either fatty or moist, and of many colors as I have said in the classification.
It is necessary, when you come to treat a knot/node, that you first examine and explore it with the instrument called a "probe," according to its form, which will come in the chapter that follows.
And the way to examine the abscesses of the nodes is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, provided that it is according to the size of the abscess; then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.
If a thin, flowing moisture comes out, note what color it is, then lance it as I have said for other abscesses; and if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, then cut it crosswise, and take it with forceps, and peel it gently on each side and watch the membrane in which it lies so that you pull it out whole with the node; and if you cannot pull it out whole, pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the node will return many times; and if a bit remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and bind the wound, and apply soothing things for a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed; and if the node is large, stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with what generates flesh.
And if the pulsating vein or other things hinder you, hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cutting out what remains of the node.
