On the cauterization of the uterus.	On cauterization of the womb.	0.97502357
When cold and humidity affect the uterus, preventing conception and corrupting menstrual flow, causing delayed onset and painful menstruation, then cauterize the area with three cauterizations around the navel as described for the bladder; and also cauterize the lower back with one or two nail-like cauterizations.	When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips. The cautery should be claviform.	0.76423025
