Chapter Seventeen.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.	0.8276268
On the excision of pterygium and the removal of excess flesh that grows in the eye.	On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.	0.69894564
A red, overlapping fleshy growth may develop in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or nearly covers it, or spreads over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.	Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	0.87801605
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you grasp all of that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.	You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps.	0.7213404
Or you grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then you cut the flesh bit by bit until you completely excise it all, taking care with the eye so that you don't harm it during the procedure, and your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for excising pannus or with small scissors. Like those with which eyelashes are grasped, as their image will appear in the chapter following this one.	Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation. Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	0.8064038
When your excision is completed and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye to prevent hot swelling.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	0.8317545
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with what calms the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals. And likewise, do this with excess flesh of this type that occurs in the eye.	If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured. So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	0.8244827
Except that you should avoid treating any eye weakened by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments, and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ is able to withstand the procedure.	But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.8260716
