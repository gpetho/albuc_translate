Chapter XIII.
On the treatment of contracture which appears on the upper eyelid.
When contracture occurs in the eye, it is a contraction of the eyelid that is drawn upward or to the right or left due to improper healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called "leporina." This contracture is either natural or accidental, caused by the improper healing of a wound, incisions, or cauterizations, or something similar.
The way to operate on this is to cut through the consolidation and separate the edges of it, then place a piece of linen cloth between them and bind them until they are healed.
And you should not use drying or constricting treatments because if you do, the contracture will return worse than ever before.
Use softening treatments such as fenugreek, and wash with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, or an ointment called 'diachylon,' which is liquefied with some oils, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat with that.
The key to your treatment is to ensure by all means that the wound does not consolidate as it did initially.
This procedure we have described is merely a correction of the contracture that does not return the place to its original form.
