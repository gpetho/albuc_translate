The First Chapter.
On cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is useful for an excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches and an abundance of discharges from the head toward the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat aches.
And in general, for every illness that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, muteness, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the ill person to vomit with a laxative medication that cleanses the head for three or four nights according to what the strength of the sick person, their age, and their constitution requires.
Then you order them to shave their head with a razor, then you have them sit cross-legged in front of you, having placed their hands on their chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the bridge of their nose, between their eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery iron, which is pictured here.
Expose [an area] of the bone the size of a probe head or a cherry pit; then lift your hand. Otherwise, reapply your hand with the same iron or another if it has cooled down.
Until you see of the bone what I have described to you; then take some salt and dissolve it in water, soak cotton in it, and place it on the area and leave it for three days. 
Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the eschar from the cautery falls off. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that as long as a wound remains open and suppurates, it is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin down to the bone and holding the cautery until part of the thickness of the bone is burned, then scraping away the burnt bone and then treating it.
Others have said that one should cauterize extensively until it has a strong effect on the bone so that a piece like a carat or a small coin falls off the bone. They claimed that this ventilates the vapors of the head from that place and they leave the wound open for a long time. 
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not recommend these two types of cautery at all, except in some people and in a risky way, and leaving it alone is better in my opinion and safer if it can be done.  For the head is weakened when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other limbs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.
