Chapter forty-three, on incising the larynx due to a swelling occurring inside the throat.	CHAPTER FORTY-THREE. On incising the larynx for a tumour arising in the throat.	0.7618956
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the order of their words.	The Ancients mentioned this laryngeal incision, but I have not seen anyone in our parts who has done it. Now here is the gist of what they say.	0.8543563
As for those with angina, they should avoid incising the larynx, as they will not benefit from it because all the vessels and the lungs are diseased.	Incision should be avoided in those suffering from quinsy, for they will not benefit from it, since all the passages and the lung will be diseased.	0.84028673
But for those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, it is necessary to use the incision of the larynx to escape the damage that results from choking.	But in those with an abscess in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, and when there is no disease in the windpipe itself, you must employ laryngotomy to avoid the mischief of suffocation.	0.86207956
So, if we want to do that, we should incise the larynx below three or four rings of the trachea, a small horizontal incision between two rings, as much as the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision because it is devoid of flesh and blood vessels are far from it.	Now when we wish to undertake this we should incise the larynx under the third or fourth ring of the windpipe with a small incision transversely between two rings, so that the incision may be through the membrane, not the cartilage. This spot is suitable for incision, for it is deficient in flesh, and there are no blood-vessels near.	0.88969046
If the practitioner is cowardly, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he avoids the blood vessels if he sees any of them, then he incises the membrane that we described.	If the practitioner be nervous, he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut down through the skin till he reach the windpipe, and avoid blood-vessels if he see any. Then let him incise the membrane which we have spoken of.	0.9130479
The incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it with what is pierced and by the interruption of the voice, and you leave the wound open for a while, so when the time in which choking is feared is over, the lips of the skin wound are brought together and stitched alone without the cartilage, then the medicines that grow flesh are used until it heals.	You can be certain of having opened the trachea by the emission of phlegm when it is pierced, and by the loss of voice. Then leave the wound open for some while. When the danger of suffocation is passed, bring the two lips of the wound together by the skin, which alone must be sutured, without the cartilage. Then use medicaments stimulating granulation till healed.	0.7572953
The author of this book said, "The explanation of all these words that we have narrated is only if they see that the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these swellings that they mentioned, and the patient is near death, and his breathing is about to stop, they go to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe a little through the wound site and be saved from death.	The author of this book says, the interpretation of this account that we have given is this: when they see that one of the tumours that they mention has obstructed the patient's throat and he is approaching death and is anxious himself to be incised, they resort to laryngotomy so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the wound and his life be saved.	0.8601937
And they were only ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the illness is over, and its course is three days or so, so then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.	They bid leaving the wound open till the worst of the disease abates; its height will last about three days; then they bid sew up the wound and dress till healed.	0.8179765
And what I witnessed myself is that a servant took a knife and put it to her throat and cut some of the trachea with it, so I was called to treat her, and I found her gurgling like a slaughtered animal, so I uncovered the wound and found the blood that came out of the wound was little, so I knew that she had not cut a vein or a jugular vein, and the air was coming out of the wound, so I proceeded and stitched the wound and treated it until it healed.	My own experience was this: a slave-girl seized a knife and buried it in her throat and cut part of the trachea; and I was called to attend her. I found her bellowing like a sacrifice that has had its throat cut. So I laid the wound bare and found that only a little haemorrhage had come from it; and I assured myself that neither the jugular vein nor an artery had been cut, but air passed out through the wound. So I hurriedly sutured the wound and dressed it until healed.	0.9012753
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, nothing more, and she returned after a few days to her best condition, so from this we say that there is no danger in incising the larynx.	And no ill befell the maid except for a hoarseness in the voice, but nothing more; and after some days she was restored to the best of health. Hence we may say that laryngotomy is not dangerous.	0.8631832
