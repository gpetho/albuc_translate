When because of melancholia the superfluities or the humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize him with such cauteries as we have described for the one who has paralysis.
And if because of melancholia the superfluity tends towards melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain is cleansed, according to what is stated previously in the section.
Afterward shave the head of the patient; then make a well-made compress of linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and let the patient be seated cross-legged, and be well held on all sides; then present the ointment, and aged sheep's butter is good; and warm it moderately over a fire, so that the finger, when placed in it, can bear it; then empty the circle inside the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient every week once with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize him by making several points with the entire cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain evenly; and then place on it cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
