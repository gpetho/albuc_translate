When the artery is cut
Many times it happens that there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut at the wound that comes from outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from the cautery of the member, and similar things; and it is very difficult to stop.
 And nevertheless when this happens to someone, hurry to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard enough that the blood calms under your finger, and no drop comes out; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you are holding your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is staunched.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, then hastily take another one of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is staunched; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well staunched especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not pulled, or by strong tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to staunch blood; and let it be tied and pressed appropriately.
Whoever administers stanching by tightly tying with cloths or applying burning things, or other similar things, will find it helps but little.
And if this happens to someone and he has neither doctor nor medicine present, he must put his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press hard enough that it is staunched over the wound and over the vein; and not move his finger, but moisten it often with cold water that is very cold until the blood is frozen and thickened and staunched; and afterward do whatever is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
