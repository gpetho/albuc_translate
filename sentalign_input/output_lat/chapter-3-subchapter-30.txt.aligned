On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.	On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.	0.9618801
When someone experiences a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then there is no treatment, as death quickly approaches the patient.	When any of the vertebrae of the back or the neck are completely dislocated or a number of vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment in this case for death is hastening toward the patient.	0.8873557
A sign of this is that the patient’s stool passes involuntarily, and they cannot control it; often, certain limbs are weakened as a result, or both of their legs, or both of their arms, or one of these; or a single vertebra is displaced from its place.	The sign of this is that the injured man passes a motion involuntarily, being unable to hold it back; often too some of his limbs go limp, either both legs or both arms or one of them.	0.8881788
Often it is displaced, and displacement frequently occurs in four directions.	If, as often happens, a single vertebra is displaced, the displacement may be in any of four directions.	0.7120963
Thus, that which is displaced backward is called a hump.	When there is a displacement backwards it is called 'curvature of the spine'.	0.5163281
The treatment for this is to consider, if the hump appeared in childhood, then there is no cure, and no recovery is possible at all.	As to its treatment: examine it; if the curvature dates from childhood then there is no treatment or cure at all for it.	0.7195312
But in cases that occur due to an accident, blow, or similar causes, the ancients have already described lengthy methods of treatment. Most often, this does not return with success.	As for the sort that occurs from a fall or a blow or the like, the Ancients indulged in lengthy dissertations thereon, giving many kinds of treatment, the greater part of which is of no use.	0.6554547
However, I have now shortened that, whose small portion excuses much of it due to my closeness to the aim; and in my explanation in which I set it forth, I have crafted its instrument differently from the way they presented and explained it.	But I have abbreviated from it, making a little which will serve in place of their much, consisting in my clarification and exposition of the sense. I have also depicted the instrument differently from their account and their explanation.	0.8430486
Thus, I say that in a hump which occurs at the front, there is no treatment or recovery from it.	I say then, that in a curvature occurring forward there is no technique or cure for it.	0.8112533
And likewise, for one that occurs on both sides as well.	And likewise in a curvature laterally.	0.60821587
Of these, only the one occurring on the back itself can be treated by the method I describe: the patient is stretched face down on a level platform near a wall, with damp padding spread beneath him, so his chest is not injured.	The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe. The patient should be stretched prone upon a level bench near a wall, and a soft palliasse should be spread under him so that his chest may not be hurt.	0.7482219
Then place a straight piece of wood fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the platform near his head, and another piece near his feet at the other end of the platform, with an assistant holding the wood without fixing it in the hole. And another assistant holds the other.	Then put a straight spar, set in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench where his head is, and another spar where his feet are at the other end of the bench. Let an assistant hold this spar, which is not to be firmly fixed in the hole, while another assistant holds the other in the same way.	0.88601565
Then wrap a soft, strong bandage over the patient's head and under his chin; extend the end of the bandage to the wood near his head and tie it there.	Then wind round the patient's chest and beneath his axillae a soft strong wrapper, and stretch one end of the wrapper to the spar at his head, and tie it to it.	0.8729036
Then fasten another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood near his feet.	Then bind other wrappers: over his hips, his knees, and by both tendons of Achilles; then bring the wrappers together and tie them to the other spar at his feet.	0.84323263
Then let each assistant pull their respective bandages toward the wood, and the two pieces of wood should not move from their places where they are set, although they should not be fixed, as we mentioned.	Then each assistant extends the spar with the tie towards himself; the two spars will not shift from their places in which they are planted, but, as we have said, they are not to be fixed.	0.8355135
And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or place a board on it. Then he should press down on the board with his feet until it returns.	Meanwhile the doctor is to press hard with both his palms upon the spine until it goes back; or he may place a board upon it and apply pressure to the board with his feet until it goes back.	0.8773175
If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three arm-lengths long. And carve a spot in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, for the end of the board to fit into. Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra. And the physician places his feet on the other end.	But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.	0.89178175
Then, if you wish, work with a winch that turns by hand: and set two pieces of wood in the ground near the patient's head at the end of the platform, each one arm-length tall; and place two pieces near his head at the end of the platform.	If you wish you may operate by means of a winch turned by hand; thus: you fix in the ground at the head of the patient, at one end of the bench, two wooden spars each one cubit long; and the same at the lower end, at his feet; there should be the distance of a span between the spars (of each pair).	0.8827235
And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and a hole has been made in each place, through which the winch operates; each piece of wood should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.	In each spar there should be a hole in which the shaft may run, and each spar should be firmly fixed in the ground so as not to move at all.	0.7741157
Then insert a round rod; it is the winch on which the bandage is wound through the two holes in the two pieces of wood.	Then you introduce a round piece of wood, the shaft on which the rope is wound, into the two openings of the two wooden spars.	0.86079335
And at its end is a hole in which a piece of wood is fixed, one palm-length, and likewise in the other two pieces of wood.	At one end of each shaft is a hole into which is firmly fixed a piece of wood a span long by which it is wound. Likewise with the other two spars.	0.7828237
Then tighten the bandages you fastened on the patient’s chest with the winch located near his head, and the bandages on his legs with the winch near his feet.	Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.	0.9155275
Then let an assistant stand by each winch, turning it with the handle that rotates the winch, while the physician aligns the vertebra, as we have described.	Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described.	0.91443145
This is the structure of the winch, as follows.	This is the figure of the winch, the bench and the patient.	0.45633107
Then, after the vertebra returns to place and the area is aligned, apply a drying plaster with egg white. Then apply wool. Afterward, place a splint of wood on top of the plaster, about three fingers in width, or around that. Its length should cover the area of the hump and extend over the healthy part of the vertebra.	After the spine has been restored and the place has been straightened it will be necessary for you to apply an absorbent plaster with egg-white, then packing, then over the plaster apply a flat splint about three fingers wide and long enough to cover the site of the curvature and several sound vertebrae on either side.	0.78588235
Then fasten it with the bandage we mentioned. And let the patient consume a light diet until he is healed.	Then let it be bandaged as is needful and let the patient follow a mild diet until he is cured.	0.7498261
If some prominence remains in the area at the end of healing, then softening and soothing medicines should be applied, along with the use of the board we described, for an extended period. At this point, a lead sheet is applied there.	If after he is healed there still remains some prominence at the site, it will be necessary to employ remedies to relax and soften the parts, together with the use for a long time of the flat splint we described; in this case a leaden plate may be employed.	0.8496877
Sometimes a prominence occurs at the back of the vertebrae of the spine, and it is thought to be a dislocation, but it is actually just a bone that now protrudes. Therefore, treatment should not be attempted with this remedy, as it may cause death.	Sometimes there occurs a prominence at the end of the dorsal vertebrae, from which one may form the opinion that there is a dislocation, whereas it will be a superfluous bone that has become prominent; do not interfere with it by this treatment, for death may result.	0.82906514
