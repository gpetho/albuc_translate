Chapter Eight
On cauterizing for forgetfulness.
That which is from phlegm, it is necessary that the ill one first be given the major electuaries and the pills that purify the brain.
Then his entire head is shaved, and a mustard plaster, written about in the chapter on plasters, is applied to his occiput several times. This is a type of cautery.
And do this in the exact order which I have mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then fine. Otherwise, cauterize him three times on the occiput, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as described previously.  If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle cauterization.
If you want to increase it, cauterize him on the two horns. Then treat him until he recovers.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form which was described previously.
