Chapter Thirty-Four
On Cauterizing the Beginning of a Hump.
This ailment frequently occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you will find at the last vertebra of his back a bead that has protruded, elevated above the other vertebrae. 
So if you see that, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner.
Let the cautery take every side of the vertebra equally, and if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with the point cautery, two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals, in the manner that we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cautery on a hump that comes from a spasm of the nerve.
