On the Method of Cauterizing the Hip in Dislocation
Chapter 42.
When mucus-like humors flow into the hip socket, causing it to dislocate, one leg will appear longer than the other when compared, and there will be an empty space at the dislocation site.
It is necessary to cauterize the patient over the hip socket using a circular cautery. First, mark around the hip with ink, following its contour, so that the hip joint falls within the center of the circle.
Use the same cautery form as used for the stomach.
If this circular cautery is not available, then apply three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery, with a depth equal to the skinâ€™s full thickness.
Then treat the area until it heals completely.
