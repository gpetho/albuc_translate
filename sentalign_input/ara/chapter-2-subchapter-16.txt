On Cutting the Pterygium and the Excrescence of the Eyes.
The pterygium is of two types: either it is nerve-like, resembling a thin, hard membrane, or it is not nerve-like, resembling a solid white moisture which, if touched with iron or if you try to take it with a hook, breaks apart.
And the hook will not hold in it. Both types begin from the larger canthus until they gradually creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye. The method of operating in cutting them is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you pick up the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards. Then you take a needle and thread it with a hair from a horse's or cow's tail and a strong thread, and bend the tip of the needle slightly and insert it in the middle of the pterygium.
And pierce it with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upwards and peel the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil with the hair, as if you were splitting it with the hair to its end. Then you cut the rest at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its cutting.  And the pterygium may be pulled with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then peel with the smooth scalpel the edge, which this is its image:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil is damaged. Then, after cutting, put in the eye some powdered salt or vitriol collyrium and leave it until the next day. Then treat it appropriately until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.  If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image:.
And gently scrape the pterygium with it from above.  If you see that it loosens and crumbles and is affected by the scraping, then immediately instill in the eye vitriol collyrium, red collyrium, or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling occurs in the eye.  Then leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then repeat the scraping procedure until it heals. As for the fleshy growth of the conjunctiva...
If the growth severely harms the eye, then grasp that growth with a hook and cut off some of it. Do not cut deeply, lest tearing occur. Then instill red or vitriol collyrium into the eyes until it heals.
