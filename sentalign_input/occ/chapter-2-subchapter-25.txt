Chapter XXV.
On warts born on the ends of the nose.
Many times a wart is born on the ends of the nose, and it is enlarged and increased in some days so that it is very noticeable.
And therefore you must cut it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the site either a cautery or burning medicine which stays on the spot.
But if its excision is delayed until it is enlarged, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of dark color, and little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous abscess; because many times to those who cut this abscess great malice comes upon the one who had it.
And if the abscess is of a mild touch and not of dark color, and sometimes excision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the site with what dries and tightens until it is healed.
