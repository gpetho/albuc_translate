of the swelling of the eye
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that has gathered in the eye, resembling dripping water, and yet it is not water;
and the way to perform the procedure is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, then take their head in your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling rise up towards your eyes;
then it should be inserted, so that it does not descend, and the light is unobstructed, and the patient can see things as they used to;
and if it does not descend, know that it is water, and the appearance of the swelling is not as we have described.
have the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and make a small hole in the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, so that the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, instill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled with honey, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
