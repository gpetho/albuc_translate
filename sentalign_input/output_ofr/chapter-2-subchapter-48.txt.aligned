These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.	These tumours under the armpit are of the type of scrofulous tumours, hard, enclosed in a capsule. Some contain humidity.	0.7921073
Those then that contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b. down to line g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, then fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.	Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day. Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.7717253
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, then cut it as we have said in the cutting of scrofula, and if the wound produces pus, then administer a cautery as we have said before.	If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind. If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.	0.72793245
