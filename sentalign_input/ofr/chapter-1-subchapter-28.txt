When there is an abscess on the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane:
if it is in the flesh, the patient feels a pain, not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels a raging pain.
And then when this treatment requires the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then mark with ink the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a spoke, of which here is the form:
And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and goes down to the syphac, until all the pus is out;
after treat it according to the treatment for issues until it is healed;
and no one should use this cautery except someone who has studied long in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have passed sometime.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
