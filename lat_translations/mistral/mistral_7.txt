Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in the knowledge of medicine along with its supplement and I have reached the end in it through expositions of it and its declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with the hand is laid low in our region and at our time completely absent; perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace has been lost, and there remain only small descriptions in the books of the ancients which have been corrupted by hands; errors and hesitation occur until intentions are closed off and the force of it is prolonged, It seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and to come with forms of iron tools, and the rest of the instruments of work; which occurs through addition to declarations and through appropriate application.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a skilled craftsman of it is not found with his hand in this our time is that the art of medicine is long and its author should exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy which Galen narrated, until he knows the remedies of limbs, and their forms, and their connection and disconnection, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and their origin, and veins, arteries, and quiet veins, and the locations of their outlets.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already said about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Whoever is not acquainted with what we have said about anatomy, already falls into error, wherein men are killed: as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, boast about it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I have seen a foolish physician cut off a scrofulous apostema from a woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in her neck: thus the woman bled to death in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 I have seen another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore, he reached for it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Thus the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I myself had already been summoned to extract it; and I saw, due to the size of the stone and the condition of the man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 I have seen another physician who was receiving a stipend from some Duke of our land on account of his medical skill: and a black eunuch was with him, who was injured near the heel of his leg; and the physician, in ignorance, bound up the fracture above the wound with iron splints, strong bands, and nails, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he bandaged him according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he dismissed him after some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until an aposteme formed on his leg, and on his foot, and it reached destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was then called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and peace ensued, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member: and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Let it (the wound) therefore halt corruption from spreading throughout the member, until it is destroyed.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a malignant apostema; and it ulcerated for days, until the corruption of its evilness with the Lord (of the disease) was revealed.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because if a cancer is pure from black bile (melancholy), then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can bear it, to be cut off entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for this reason, O Sons (of the art), it is necessary that you know that an operation is divided into two divisions: one operation which is associated with safety; and another operation, by means of which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have now awakened in every place of this book where the operation comes which has fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of this and separate (it) yourselves from it; lest foolish men find a way to speak and disgrace (the art).
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore receive (the art) with care and protection, and treat your sick ones with ease and firmness, and use a better way leading to grace of God for health and praiseworthy success; and abandon terrible sicknesses difficult to heal; and remove from yourselves that which causes fear, so hesitation in faith and comfort may not enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally (leads) to the wealth of your possessions.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat evil sickness; lest you be called an evil doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now this Treatise has been divided into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, the procedure has been divided, and arranged from head to foot, as well as the forms of the instruments and tools for Cautery, and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter Second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and wounds; on the extraction of arrows and similar objects, and all of this is divided and arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter Third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration and relocation, cure of twisting, and similar conditions; divided and arranged from head to foot, and according to the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 Chapter on the Benefits and Harms of Cautery; when it is suitable, when it should be used, whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I recall the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the qualities of the remedies and the harm caused by it, and in what composition it should be displayed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the cautery and the harm it causes is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also, there were many wise men who spoke about it and disagreed among themselves; for myself, I am content with little of their discourse, fearing a lengthy discussion.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore that the cautery applies universally to every composition, which is with matter or without it; except for two compositions, which are hot composition without matter and dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In hot and dry composition with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some indeed said that the cautery is beneficial in it (hot and dry composition with matter).
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 Others said the opposite, that the cautery is not suitable for this illness, which is due to heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal an illness that is hot and dry with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite said that by cautery it is beneficial for every illness due to heat and dryness which happens in the bodies of men; because when you compare a human body and its humidities with fire composition, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by his words; because I have already proven that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not necessary that he comes to it unless the one who has already been proven and has experience in the last exercise of the chapter Cauterii, and knows the diversity of human compositions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and causes of them, and their properties, and the space of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining temperaments (complexions), there is no fear for you; and especially in diseases that are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 Now all physicians agree on them, and they have not disagreed in the treatment with the cautery in those diseases.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over the cautery with medicine burning, it is because fire is simple, whose action does not extend beyond the member being cauterized, and it does not harm another joined member with it, unless there is a slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine extends to what is distant from the members; and perhaps it causes difficult healing of the disease in the member, and perhaps it kills (the patient).
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Now this has become known to us through experience, because of the duration and effort required for study and art, as well as the position on the truth of things; and for this reason I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not forbidden to this book of mine, I would bring you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases that have been demonstrated in philosophical discourse, which would be clarified for your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that they themselves disagree on the time when the cautery should be done, and place the better time in truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that the cautery is suitable at any time; therefore, the damage that occurs due to time is absorbed in the benefit that attracts with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, sudden pains that cannot tolerate delay; therefore, it is feared that what occurs from them will be greater than a small damage due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And let not that enter your minds, O sons, that they do not consider, except for the common people and foolish physicians, that there is no always a return to health in the illness which is cured by cautery: and they set forth this as a consequence, and matters are not as they think: therefore because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and removes the humidities which are the causes, whence arises pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, cautery is superfluous over medicine due to its quick recovery and the strength of its operation, and its power of dominion: and it is possible that illness may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the sick, and the location of his illness, and the strength of its power: and that which is prepared in his body from an aggregation of superfluidities in him: and that which has reached him for acquisition by foods and similar things from such causes, unless there is illness, in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle illness in a member of few superfluidities and humidities, such as cautery of the tooth, may be possible that that pain will not return to him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this is rare.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the common people again, that cautery is the last medicine, is true: not for what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure given by medicine, nor by any other after the departure of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 Matters are, however, the opposite of what they intend, and the purpose that cautery is the last medicine, is not, except when we administer modes of cure in some illness, and these do not give medicine: then afterwards we administer cautery, and it gives a cure: thence comes the idea that cautery is the last medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than one with iron; and they said this only because of the equality of gold, and the loftiness of its substance; and they said that it does not cause a place for cautery to produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 That is not absolutely true; because I have proven that it does not do this in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you make a fire cautery with gold in fire, it is not shown to you when it is heated according to the quantity that you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it goes towards it, coldness, and if you add more heat upon it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into occupation; and for this reason, a cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, due to its rightness for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have ordered it from head to foot: so that those who seek it will find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here the cauterization is directed at the lordship of moisture and coldness over the brain; which are the two causes of soda and excessive flow of fluids from the head to the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, toothache, sore throat, and all disease that occurs due to coldness, such as paralysis, soda, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is that you command the sick person: to evacuate in the first place with purifying medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then command him to make an opening in his head with a new nail.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit before you squarely, so that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the palm of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever therefore your middle finger comes to be, mark that place with an unburnt brand.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery in oil: whose shape is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it upon the marked place with the unburnt brand, and you pull it down with a descent, by which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then you quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a quantity of bone or herb is exposed from the skull, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, you place your hand again with the iron itself or with another if it becomes cold: until the bones, which I told you, are visible.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cotton in it, and place it upon the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place the cotton immerged in butter upon him, and leave it on the place until the scab of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with the four-part ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They say that when a wound remains more open, it exudes pus; therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized until it reaches the bone: and the cautery should be held, until something thick of the bone is burnt.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then after what has been burned from the bone, it is shaved, then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And some say that when cauterizing, it should be reached to the end, so that it imprints an impression in the bone to such an extent that the bone falls out, which happens as the form of a keratosis; or an instrument which women place infused with small alphabet letters: and they believe, that vapors from the head expire at this location, and the wound remains open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be cauterized until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 For me, however, these two types of cautery are not seen at all, except for certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And it is better, in my opinion, to let it go along with his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For indeed the head becomes weak from the dissolution of its own continuity; as we have testified in other members: and particularly when the head of the weak is naturally frail: and the first type of cautery, indeed, is safer and better for me, and I use it: therefore operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and it persists in an unwell person, using hyson (a type of tea), mustard, leeches, hot applications, and unguents.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery as I have said, and none of those [remedies] provide any relief for him: then consider it.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the unwell person is strong by nature and not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery, but carefully.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on top of all his horns of the head with cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated and a quantity of bone as I have said is exposed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one cautery at the occiput (the back part) of his head, in the place called "vas" (a hollow or cavity): it is a place where a ventous (pustule) is placed: grind your ointment and do not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the unwell person finds intense pain due to this, and different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say that this cautery should be in its place: it is necessary that it be the cautery with which horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput (the back part) of his head should be cauterized more subtly with the cautery with which the middle part of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for hemiplegia, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is treated with cleansing medicines, and other treatment is administered as I have said in the divisions of diseases, and this does not provide relief: then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a hot medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with burning medicine, is to take one garlic clove, peel it and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut the painful area at the time with a wide lancet until there is a space under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it [the tooth] there under the skin until it is concealed; then press upon it with a proper plaster and let it remain for fifteen hours; then dissolve it and extract the garlic; and let it rest for two or three days; afterwards place the cautery submerged in butter on it until the place becomes pus; then care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise on poisons.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 The cautery of this [the gallbladder] with iron is to be done according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Fire Cautery, whose form is as follows:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called the "Clavile": because the head of it is like a nail's shape, in which there is something rough, and in the middle of it is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you turn the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity to be burned be of the thickness of the skin, as its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and there is bleeding.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the cautery in water and salt, and place it on the spot for three days; then place the cautery with butter; afterwards care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this half-skull with the tip of a second cautery (cultellarius).
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Beware not to cut an artery in this hemicranium, not old one properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 On the method of cauterizing in the ancient hemicranium.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat the hemicranium, as previously said in cure and in the division of diseases, and healing does not help: and when, from the illness, you see that what was said about cauterization with the first cautery or cauterization with fire is not enough, then it is necessary to prepare the cautery iron until it turns white, marking a line on the place of pain whose length is half the digit, or like that: and place your hand aside, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to beware of continuous jaw movement during mastication so that the side or nerve moving it is not burned, thus causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And take care and caution regarding the flow of blood from the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 There is fear in its cutting, and especially to him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent or experienced; and he gives up the operation with it first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come with a reminder of the management of blood flow following the cutting of an artery according to its method, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough for him, and you see the body of the patient bearing the cautery in the middle of the head as we said, then treat a wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish to administer the cautery as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 Cauterization is indeed better in this way and more suitable.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to coldness and is treated with solutions, and other treatment as we said in the division, but the pain does not subside, then cauterization with fire; and this is what is called a point, whose shape is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the point after its burning should be made circular around the entire ear, as it is turned; or around each side if pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And lengthen (the point) with the cautery slightly from the root of the ear after marking the places with hot iron; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points on every ear, and so forth.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then cure the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Section on the method of cauterization in torturing.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The condition that is treated with cauterization due to torturing, is not anything other than those arising from phlegm, as we said in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for types that occur due to exhaustion and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When treating this type of torturing with herbs, mouth washes and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little lower than the earlobe, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur unless in the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the shape of cauterization is to cauterize the point itself with the cautery directly at the tip of the upper end of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head; and another one on the earlobe; whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of a Cautery, and it is a species made from a knife, whose shape is as follows: nevertheless, it should not be too subtle, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife in it should have little excess bulk.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the location, when applied: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 § On the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When the apoplexy becomes old and your treatment does not help and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all the horns of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery on the occiput of the head, according to what was mentioned; and the method of cauterizing should be according to what was mentioned.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also, it is cauterized with a cautery on the face of the stomach: and it is more for the final treatment.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for him, when applied.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 § On the method of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in drink there are first of all large amounts of hyson tea, and cleansing pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave completely the head of the sick one, and place on his head a plaster from synapism described in the book of plasters; place it often.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 It is indeed the method of cautery; make this accordingly in the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is healed by it, that is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; place between each cautery a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then take care of the cautery, with that which came before it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an addition and the sick one can endure it: then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you wish an addition: then cauterize him on top of both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then take care of him until he is healed; let the cautery be anointed in the form that was mentioned before.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over the back part of it, and three over the spondyles of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If you need softening of the body with many of those [remedies], and if the patient is weak and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the spondyles of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until most of his skin is burned off, and you scrape your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of him until he is cured; and thus the cautery should be used on Oliva (Olive oil).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI:
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 A epileptic should not be cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cleanse the brain of his first, with hyson, and with the rest of the treatment that I have mentioned in the division: when he is severely ill or he endures the taking of medications well.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If, however, he is a child who does not endure medications, then gargarism is administered and cleansing mastication for the brain before that for many days with good food purification.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then scrape his head, afterwards cauterize him with a single Cauterio in the middle of the head according to what was mentioned before: and with another cauterio at the back of his head, and over all the horn of his skull with cauterio.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If he is strong and tolerating, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have mentioned in having paralysis, and softening of the body on spondiles of the neck and back: let the Cauterium be oiled according to the method mentioned before.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivities leading to melancholy and his body is damp, then give him in drink what cleanses his brain according to what was mentioned before: then scrape the head of the sick man, and make afterwards a well-centered tortellum made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of his head: let the sick man sitting square be held by all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then present the ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more appropriate from ancient butter (of) sheep.

Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moistness, and let him sit in a bath, on fasting days for some time.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize him on two sides with two cauteries, if there is no discharge of water from both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is no discharge of water from one eye: and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries that are beneath the skin: and let the cauteries be long in width like the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something coming from it (the affected area), then immediately cut it off with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and caution against bleeding.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent, and they are over veins and arteries which are manifest on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is from superfluidities of cold, phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with the same cautery as I mentioned in the discharge of water, cauterize in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if there is need for addition, then cauterize him carefully on all sides of the eye, over the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows in any part with two cauteries; and the cautery should extend from both sides; and the length of the entire cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, but rather according to the amount that is burned by the third eyelash.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward and poke the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 Cautery is in it according to two modes: either cautery with fire; or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In cautery with fire, instruct the sick person to release their hairs before it, if they are among those who clean them, until they have been extended and matched in length.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they prick him at his origin: then constrict his eyes with a plaster so that they do not move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and matched in length, then place the head of the sick one on your lap: then mark over the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, mark what is in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a bowl soaked in egg white or slime of peas on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the fire-cautery, whose shape is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize on the shape which you marked little by little in several places, until the surface of the skin burns, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, completely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of the health of your work is that if you see the eyelid already contracted and hairs rising at the prick of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift up your hand then: and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a bowl with butter on it until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If some hair returns after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it until they rise to their own place and match so that they do not prick the eye again.

Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and from unsoaked chalk, each a weight of an ounce or about that; then grind these together well with good grinding, and make it quickly so as not to get cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread it out from that on a cloth which you have made, as the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or both eyes.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You move it as often as the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, because his bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While it continues this which he feels as a bite, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.

Command the sick one to put his head in your lap and hold his head servant's hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken with his own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place cotton soaked in oil or slippery elm poultice on his eye: then heat the cautery whose shape is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be concave like the shape of a goose feather quill, from one end of which is made the cautery; and if you want it to penetrate to the other end, and if you want it to extend upward in this manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave form is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and draw out pus from it; and if it is not open, then open it and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place on it the hot cautery.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near it for a moment on the cautery near the eye, at the part of the nose, so that your hand does not move or the sick person is disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach at the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place cotton with butter and heal it with an ointment of healing, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it exceeds forty days and does not heal, then place a sharp, corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed; and grind it according to its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another mode of cautery for a fistula, which some of the first ones called it.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Apply to the location of the fistula, and find it; then place upon it a fine cannula (camahan), that is, a fine tube, whose form this is [draws a diagram].

And pour upon it a quantity of drachmae of liquid lead, and hold your hand with good retention, and do not move the weak one at all, so that the liquid lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 It is necessary that you place on the eye of the weak one a hot compress steeped in egg white, or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the spot of the fistula and heals it by a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed along with what we said through cautery, and cure, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage, and to bring back the fistula into the course of the nose, according to which it comes into its own proper place.

Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery is with butter, take butter from the cow, and carry it in an iron cauldron or earthenware.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then receive the pot and cover it over the edge of the wound.

Then immerse it in boiling butter and place it on the painful tooth quickly and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or a cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery with fire is to heat the iron or brass pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 Let there be something bulky in the body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.

Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And when making an impression with the cautery, the weak bone should be filled with good butter and kept for an hour; then it is spit out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.

Having two open ends so that smoke exits at the cautery from one end: and place it ignited upon the ulcer once, and if necessary, again, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then let it be for three days, and place warm butter on top of it until what the fire has burnt is removed.

Chapter XXVII: When the head is dislocated for reasons of moistness and it does not heal within an hour of returning to its place after dislocation, until it has become accustomed to return, then it should be dislocated again slightly, as we have already testified about this, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies down on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then you scrape the skin that is inside the Titillico towards the upper part with your left hand fingers; and if it is a joint that is dislocated internally.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take the cautery heated by fire, having two openings.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows: (description of the shape of the cautery).
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side and you reach the shape of the cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes there is a cauterization with a cautery having three prongs, for which the figure of cauterization is then six cauteries: and they are prongs according to the fineness touched.

When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach until it removes itself from its mixture, and catarrhs multiply for it, and continuous methods of treatment do not suffice: then the sick person should lie on his back, extend his legs, and put forth his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cautery of the size of a finger under the concavity of the chest and a hooked cautery, and two cauteries below the sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes a triangle.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And extend between them so that they do not unite when there is pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery shall be the size of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And let the figure of the cauteries be in this shape without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery which makes this cautery be one in the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with the one who fears this cautery, and there is to be a mark made on the stomach according to the quantity desired, as with wax; then the same (stomach) is cauterized with the point cautery; then it is cared for with the cure that preceded until it heals.

When there is pain in the epiploon due to coldness and moistness, or due to gross windiness until it exits from its natural outlet, and the sick person has been treated with what was said before, but does not improve, then the sick person should lie on his back on a table, and marks are made with wax with three points of cautery according to this figure, and the same quantity below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and there should be space between each cauterium equal to the thickness of a digit; and the cautery should be long enough for the body; and do not press your hand hard with the cauterium.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And the quantity to be burned should not exceed the thickness of the skin; half of it should not be added; and the sick person should stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If (the patient) is not standing, then let him lie down who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to use these three points of cautionery with a sharp-pointed cautery when you have subtlety and wisdom in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And beware that you do not proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and when the thickness of the skin is burned, the body is burned completely, and it reaches the intestines; because the skin there is delicate, therefore know this.

When it happens that there is an exiture, and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver flesh or its tunica: then, if it is in the liver flesh, a weak pain and heaviness without sharpness will occur; and if it is in the tunica of the liver, with intense pain, it becomes evident that the treatment has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the patient must lie down on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then form the place of the abscess with the hot iron; then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize with that iron until the entire skin is burned and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with treatments for discharge until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not necessary to use this method of cautery, unless the person's devotion to the art of medicine is prolonged; and whose hands these diseases occur with experience; then dare on such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better to abandon it in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Method of cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Quando accidit inflammatio pleurae, cum
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia is to be used for cold pleurisy as follows.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And you should receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia a longer root, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil; then ignite it.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one iron in that which is between the junction of the collarbone and neck, and with two small irons under the jaw a little downward slope to the part that is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also, in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs downwards towards the back slightly; and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two scapulae; and with two cauteries from the sides of the chest, the lower one being the one that is between the two scapulae.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be done so that the smell of the skin is evident.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And certain ancients have said that there are some who use the cautery made of iron resembling a rod; they heat it and insert it into that which is between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and the pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear, for either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at that place which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32. On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the disease of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases and your treatment does not work, then cauterization is used for it according to three modes, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One is that you make three or four cauteries in the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose preceding figure has already been given.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the thickness between each cautery be as thick as a finger or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And the method of cauterization shall be equal to that which we said in the cauterization of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And you must not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is: holding two cauteries, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where it reaches the weak elbow on the left side; and your lifting of the skin should be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two hot irons deeply, until they pierce the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with another iron having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you release it to emit pus for many days; indeed, it is more beneficial than the others that have come before in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery does not fall in Hydropsy, unless strictly indicated.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a Hydropsy patient according to the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one over the stomach, another over the liver, one over the spleen, two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one on the front of the stomach, and another on the front of the heart; and the depth of the cautery should be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery to let it emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 Do not evacuate the patient from treatment after cauterization, as it is necessary that two intentions be applied to him; and healing will hasten towards him with divine aid.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clavicular; according to its previous form. And the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 De modo cauterizandi Pedes, Crura, et Mamm
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are incised in hydropic conditions and filled with citron water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the site between auricularem and anularem [joints]; then remove your hand with the cautery, without twisting it; afterwards, remove your hand; do not return to it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For indeed, the citron water will boil, and let the cautery be in this shape [round or oval].
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then, make two cauteries on both legs and let each leg have two cauteries; let the cautery have an end like a small knife, and let it be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about halfway down the leg; and above the hip, there should be two cauteries; leave the open cautery without prolonged treatment so that some water boils out of it; then treat it with what I have said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 On the method of cauterization in the opening of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 In cuius modi cauteri in fistula vesicae
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the abdomen is opened by cold and moisture so that its powers of retention and digestion in the stomach and intestines are weakened, it should be treated with methods of healing, but it does not heal: and you see a sick person who can tolerate an excessive cautery due to strong vitality, then you cauterize it with a large cautery over its own stomach, according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery and four fine cauteries around the navel and a fine cautery on the clavicle, and with a large cautery over the alum on top of the small intestines or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture and a sick person who can tolerate it, then you cauterize it with a large cautery over the breastbone and over the entire ilium: and possibly you may add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For it is a treatment that does not miss its effect.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 In cuius modi cauteri in fistula recti, in
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are old hemorrhoids in the anus, many or one, and they are thick, cold or corrupted with moisture, and they are treated with what was said in the division, but healing does not occur: then cauterize it with three cauteries over the lower part of the hipbone slightly below the iliac crest in a triangular shape under the almond-shaped mark, and with a cautery under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that its stomach is cold and its food does not digest, and you see its face shrivel up, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cautery as previously mentioned, and over its liver and another over its spleen with a cautery on the clavicle: and let the cautery remain open for some time: then heal it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Incapitulare de modo cauterizandi althelulum
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised althelul and with your last hand move it until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many altheluls, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them by applying what is applied to them from ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the tumor, it is more beneficial in curing it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Incipitur de modo cauterizandi fistulum in anum
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey cutting and operation as we have described at that place, and he is afraid of it, perhaps he will heal with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When a fistula occurs and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and the surrounding areas are corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, it is necessary to probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then know the depth of it by probing it with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery which is similar to a rod.\]
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce yourself burning into the fistula and stop when the probe goes in as deep.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery over it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once, twice or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or major vein if it is there; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then take care of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do that except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, because it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the location until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If however the place is sealed and the material is cut away, and it remains for a long time like that: then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if the material is not cut away from it, then you will know that it has penetrated, or its bone within it is corrupted, or as one of those: whose memory comes to mind in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or gross wind, and it weakens the body, then you must cauterize it above the almethenes on the kidneys with a cautery over the entire kidney with a clavicle-shaped cautery, whose memory comes beforehand.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it for the second time in the same place on the almethenes.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why will three lines appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more effective in providing relief.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, until it no longer retains urine, then cauterize it at the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with a cautery from one side of the scrotum and another on its other side; and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery or two cauteries, if necessary; and let the preceding cauterization be as deep as a nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 When there is weakness in the uterus due to cold and moisture, so that it no longer retains the menstrual flow, then caut
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When there is cold and moisture in the uterus that prevents conception, and its menstruation is spoiled, and their production is delayed, and pain occurs near their arrival, then it is necessary to be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said when cauterizing the bladder, and a lower back cautery or two cauteries; let the cauterization be as deep as a nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Chapter on how to cauterize the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When there is a flow of mucous humidity to the anus, and its exit from its place becomes a cause; and its sign is that a leg is extended over another when they are brought together; and a hollow place in it is found where there is dislocation.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the weak place on the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark its location with encaustum (hot wax) around the anus, as it is rotated; and let the anus fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of a shape that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large oily cautery: and let the depth be made according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 [Heading: The method of cauterizing in Sciatica.]
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the buttock of an ankle and its cause is coldness and dampness: and the sick person is treated as we have said in the division, but the treatment does not help, and it worsens: then it is necessary that you release the sick person from thick humors with foul pills or with artificial pills and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterizing in this is according to two methods: either with a cautery with acting medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 The cautery with fire, is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of these is that you cauterize on the buttock of an ankle with three triangular cauteries in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And let them make a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 However, sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on top of the buttock of an ankle.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?\]   Cum enim exterius est cauterium: et interea
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of an ankle, use one: so that it may contain the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterizing in Sciatica, when the pain clings to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place indicated by the sick person where there is pain, and cauterize your cautery four fingers towards the side of the wood [limb]: let the cauterium be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 Let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, then cauterize there with a puncture cautery, three, or four, or more if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is turned towards the leg under the knee, then cauterize it there with a sharp cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful with all your cauterizations so that you do not burn the nerve or a major artery and harm the sick person through this, or cause contracture.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have seen one and another who cauterized above the tendon [limb], and burned it in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all over, and the whole foot decayed; then there was a rupture of the abdomen, and death followed that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Some wise men have said that in the cauterization of an aneurysm, this is the method for doing it.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a cup-shaped instrument of iron, whose diameter is half a palm [about 2 inches]; and at its opening it should be according to the size of the nail tip or less; and within this cup there should be a third cup.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space that is between all the cups be equal to the size of a knuckle; and let the cups be open from two sides; and let their height be like a knuckle or two knuckles; and make handles of iron appropriately for the cups.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then heat it in fire until it turns red and sparks; then place it on the dish of the weak anvil laid upon a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let it be for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Then pack it with butter; and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis, in this form of cautery, we are not accustomed to use it much due to the terror of its appearance; and therefore, because few are found who dare upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is among the good cauterizations for him who can bear it, and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with stimulating medicines is to make two samia having a perforated armillary sphere, into which descends the hinge of its door from brass or iron, long enough for the wall; whose height should be two knots, or as if they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space that is between them be of the thickness of a finger, and they should be open below and above; and let them hold each other according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on the dish of the weak anvil, laid upon a healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand heavily on the dish of the weak anvil.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between the two circles that has been heated slightly with fire and hold it for the length of an hour; let the weak one bear its biting and burning, for he finds the bite like fire until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wash your hand with the tool and clean the weak anvil with warm water along with sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 Place the butter on top of it until the burnt blackness is removed; and let it stay for some days, and a pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 This is the last remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat that with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a socket for it containing water, as you did with the anchor equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 This is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and half the quantity of unburnt lime, grind each separately; put them in a new pot whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that enters the radius; put another earthenware pot below it; throw alkali and lime into water, which will submerge them by a finger; when you compress them with your hand, good compression; let go of the pot until the sharp water comes down through the pierced part of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then combine all that water and throw it on another lime; boil until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For it will then be very strong for sharpness, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines are those with which anchors are cauterized, also as tesisie, and honey of cardamom, and lime with soap, so that each is mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen himself reported in his telling about the cure of a man, from whom pain in the anchor and the sciatic vein was cured; he said it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said, because it does not require another treatment, and because it was healed from one application, until he returned, because perhaps he himself went into the bath, and already came out healthy from it.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from green mustard: and if green mustard is not found, dry mustard should be taken, fresh: and it should be ground well with some fat, and placed on the place where there is pain, or leg, or hip: and it should be tied, and left for a quantity of three hours, or until the patient feels the relaxation caused by the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes warm, introduce him into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain retreats, and it heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides says that goat's feces, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, should be applied in this way: and make the cautery according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and immerse it in ancient oil, and place it on the deep place that is between the big toe of the foot and the heel, and nearer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat's feces and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing this until the sensation reaches to the ankle and the pain stops.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called Vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Whenever there is pain in the back due to multiple causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, it occurs from the infusion of cold and moist matter. Cauterization does not apply except in this one case which is made from the infusion of cold and moist matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick person with foul pills, and similar substances, they should be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the almend seed. After marking them with encaustic in every line five cauteries, or more according to the quantity that comes from the strength of the sick person: and cauterization should be done with cauteriopuncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, along with the middle claw cautery, in this shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the beginning of hump-shaped growths.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This disease often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its onset in children is: that it occurs over him with constriction during breathing and movement, and you find at the bottom of the spine and its nodes, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that, and wish to make it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the cautery should cover all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two lines or three; let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to apply cauterization to a hump-shaped growth that arises from spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterization for gout, and its associated pains.
Caput XLVI.	 De Cauteriis ad Sanguinem Coagulantib
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 Chapter XLVI.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When therefore gout (Podagra) is treated for a cold cause and the pains are not relieved, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is to cauterize him after evacuation at the joints of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be Oilvaire.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its shape.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to make punctures on the sole of the foot, then do so with a cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on all parts of the knee with three or four cauteries, with this same cautery being Clauile.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more than one cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what was said in the chapter itself.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the knuckles, as if two lines were rolled [together].
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If some pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them all, on every node and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a sick person from good care, from the reception of medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if good care is given and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine or spermatic cord descends towards the testicle, which is beginning: then it is necessary to order the sick person to fast on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he shall use from the softening substances, so that the stool may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then he shall sit between your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath until it comes out or appears a hernia or an intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers and mark the place of rupture on his neck with wax seal together with a seal like half of a circle above his body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cautery in this shape until it becomes white and throw sponges on it.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then bring the intestine or hernia into its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the servant put his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the weak one, and placed a pan under him and another servant is serving at his legs and another one at his chest holding his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on the seal upon him with your hand holding it straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 Hold him until you find the bone with it; or if you have not found the bone in the first attempt, do it again with another position.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine at the time of your cautery, lest you burn him and harm or kill him by that or great suffering.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know this, that when you do not find the bone with the cautery, your work does not succeed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 It is necessary that the cautery be subtle for children according to their measurement.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with ointments until he is well.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 Let the weak one lie down on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary that you provide him with food according to the length of his treatment time, so that his belly may be softened and not expel the intestine in attempts or in evacuations.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when one wishes to operate after forty days, then administer a correctly made bandage and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And reduce from labor, and fill with food and drink, and with vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when this treatment is used, thus it heals completely by cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the cure for hernias with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen, and they are beginning and there is a desire not to add them, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be as third of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then care for it as I have said: and do not add it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the first ones have said that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After signing it with an encase, and a line is placed which is across its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the cautery tongs.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in pains due to accident or trauma.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in some members due to an accident or trauma, and the pain persists for a long time, and there is no healing with medications, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery for all members be according to its size, and its smallness, and weakness, and power, and location of twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it heals with the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then apply the cautery on him again.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is customary for these pains to move from one limb to another that is nearer.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, you must follow them with the cautery until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy are sometimes benefited by cautery, with great benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And primarily the types of leprosy caused by corruption of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when considering cauterization of it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and you have treated it with what was said in the division and it does not improve or stop: then beware of corruption spreading over his entire constitution; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known as the fontanel, and the second below it facing the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two on top of the two horns, and one behind on the occipital bone.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally place your hand with the cautery slightly, until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the skin is separated from it; so that the expiration of gross vapors from it is alleviated, and cauterize also over the spleen, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if leprosy has spread over the sick person and is apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which were mentioned on the head, and a cautery over the tip of the nose, and two cauteries over both cheekbones, and two cauteries over both shoulder blades, and six over both hip bones, and one large one over the alhahosos at the base of the spine and one above it, in the almeidati; and two on the ankles: that is, one on each ankle, and two on the elbows, and two on the wrists, and two on the tendons of the chest, and cauterize over the entire joint of his fingers of both hands and feet, and cauterize over the entire heel of both feet, and the soles of both hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Be careful not to burn the nerves that are on top of the heel bone, last one.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is burned with an iron over the cheek bone, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the jawbone.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that, the more cautery you apply, the greater is the help, and the better it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do; therefore, because his body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries be of different sizes and shapes according to the members and joints; following the types of iron tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care to burn with cautery made from wheat flour and honey, and with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on the mode of burning in unconsciousness.
Caput L.	 Chapter L. (caput means chapter or head)
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a member becomes unconscious and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and does not heal, then burn the unconscious member with cauteries, according to the size of the member or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery penetrate somewhat into the depth of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes the burning is done for a kind of unconsciousness that happens in the hand and foot, in the joints of the back near the exits of the nerves that move that member; and the unconsciousness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to do it unless he who knows the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves moving the body is present.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on the mode of burning in ulcers (Albaras).
Caput LI.	 Chapter L.I (caput means chapter or head)
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When an ulcer becomes old and does not improve with any of the remedies of medicine; then burn it with a deep cautery somewhat, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white part is removed and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of yourself with a mixture of grain of wheat, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of fennel, and blood of a dove, and blood of a heron; from each of these be equal parts; mix all these together, spread them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Method of cauterization for Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it; then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it rotates (revolves).
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But to me it does not seem good; for I fear that it will burn (ulcerate); and I have already seen this happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is better to cauterize around it with a circular cautery, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Method of cauterization for Adubelati (carcinoma of the anus).
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has a boil, and it slows down in maturation, either due to an excess causing it or due to the person being old and weak with little blood, or due to time and the desire to hasten in the maturation of the boil, then cauterize its surrounding area with small and numerous cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it go [the boil].
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten in maturation by itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery with fire, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it in the center of the boil until it penetrates the skin; let the cautery be weak, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for [the wound] until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on cauterizing a cancerous tumor.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is nothing but walking corruption consuming itself, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see corrosion in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then the cautery should be large, small and large nails as appropriate to the place where the corrosion is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you root out the entire corruption and there remains nothing of it deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it be for three days and place over the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until all scabs are removed and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If after three days you see that new flesh is growing healthily without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on the part remaining from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 Corrosion is sometimes treated with a strong medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 The sore rises where the cautery was applied.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is more effective; and I have already said that cautery with a strong medicine is useful in division; therefore, use it when you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of feet: and it is a large, filtered matter that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And indeed, among them there are two modes of cautery: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, it is to be made like a concave cautery similar to a vulture's pen: which should be made of iron, according to its size containing a nail at all parts: and it should have delicate edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply ointment of wild malva leaves crushed with salt on it, and leave the ointment upon it during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For this, it will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with a healing salve until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then administer cautery with hot water: and it is to take a cannula of copper or iron or from a vulture's pen: and place it upon the nail or althea.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a little hot water into the cannula: hold your hand and you turn it with the compression of your hand for a short time, so that the tip of the cannula is pressed against the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the deep, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a short while after the bite of the hot water an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, for the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Perform the procedure on each one (part) after the other, until you reach all that are within the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them once they have been removed, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 On the method of cauterizing in the tremor (shaking palsy).
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI (66th chapter).
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling due to coldness in a nerve occurs to someone, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it should be cauterized with four or five cauteries on the dorsal spine, and between each dorsal spine with a cautery, and in its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For trembling ceases with cauterization of oil, and health hastens from the illness of coldness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 On the method of cauterizing Albatheir (Al-Buhaitar).
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII (67th chapter).
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes in the body Albathir (Abscesses) are expelled, that is, pustules which come from corrupted materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear, they should first be cauterized on every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and myrtle wood, whose tip is lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long Aristolochia (Aristolochia serpentaria).
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized for the beginning of its (Abscess's) expulsion according to this method, and they do not increase; and excess is broken, making them (the pustules) disappear, and healed from it.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 Nevertheless, it should be done afterwards with venesection.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 On the method of cauterizing in bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII (68th chapter).
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Often bleeding from an artery occurs which is cut near a wound, which happens from outside, or at the incision of a boil, or a cautery member, and similar things; and it becomes difficult to separate him.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When therefore it happens to someone, then approach with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your pointing finger upon it: and tie it tightly, until the blood is held under your finger and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small oil lamp cautionery, and many in number: and blow upon them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautionery upon the vein, after you remove your finger quickly: hold the cautionery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautionery, then take another cautionery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not cease to do that with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other evil happens to the weak person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially since the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautionery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is pulled out, the ends contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it may be tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines of the property for cutting off blood are placed upon it, and it is tightened with a suitable constriction plaster.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 But he who administers the cutting off with a thread and tightening with a bandage, or placement of burning objects and similar things, does not fully cure him, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If it happens to anyone and the physician is not present nor the medicine: then begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of that vein, as we have told, and with strong compression until the blood is obstructed from the superior part of the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And let the finger not be removed, on it with cold water of strong coldness always, until the blood freezes, and swells, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile let him consider in it what needs cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter on incisions, perforations, and phlebotomy in wounds and their likes.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 As we have said in Chapter One, every sickness where it is fitting with fire to burn and medicine burning, as well as its occasions, the causes of it, and the instruments of it, and the forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I have placed there chapters from the neck to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that it may be alleviated for one seeking what he seeks.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my sons, to know what is in this chapter from fear of that which is in Chapter One about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for that reason, it is necessary that the caution be stronger because in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often falls with blood, with which life stands during the opening of a vein or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of the exit, or treatment of the wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone and their likes: from all of which are associated tremor, fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you, lest it fall upon you where there is hesitation, for sometimes it falls upon you in this art as with the modes of men with the modes of weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who becomes angry with his illness and death is easy for him; on account of the vehemence which he finds from his weakness, and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when there is illness, it signifies death through fear.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And from these there is one who offers you his remedy and promises health to you, but his illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not fitting that you should agree with him who comes to you of such a sort.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be greater than greed and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume concerning anything from him, unless after certain knowledge, which has been verified among you as to the matter to which it has come a commendable sequence.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the care of all your sick ones, by prognostication and indication as to that to which it is fittingly healing.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in this there is for you an aid in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and not remove from you direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet; so that the matter sought by you is relieved and provided for your needs.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 [Section] On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this ailment often occurs in boys during childbirth: either when the midwife tightens the boy's head without restraint.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And it sometimes happens due to hidden causes which are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed I myself have not seen this sickness in others than boys: and to everyone whom I saw it happened, death followed: therefore it seemed to me fitting to abandon the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed I myself have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could not sit upon himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And indeed this moisture, either accumulates between skin and bone; or accumulates under the bone on the sacrum.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on him, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make a slit in the middle of the head, one fissure in width: and the length of the fissure shall be as two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of the trepan (trephine).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If then the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two slits, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see openings of the skull from every part: and water gushes out when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary that you make three slits in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie the slits with bandages and small pieces of cloth.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then pour wine and oil on it for five days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then cut the ligament and care for the wound with probes and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not let go of the head without balance (or equilibrium).
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick with dry food of slight moisture until the limb recovers and is healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where it appears that the size of the abscess is, and the collection of water (or pus).
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head or in the forehead, or in the right or left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore, with incision, ascend where it appears to you the abscess and filling of water: and cut it as far as possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not incise the artery and let blood flow, and the sick person dies from this blood loss with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Section on incising arteries that are after the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrhs occur to the eyes or chest and it persists, and no treatment with medications is effective: then the final cure is in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cut them (the arteries), let the sick person shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then scrape the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person tighten his neck with any of his own towels.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein is pulsating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And both places are depressed areas that are behind the ears and are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both with hot iron and cut each one with a spatula on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, introduce a spatula under the artery and cut it from above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 When a vein is cut, blood gushes out by pulsatile discharge, which leaps to the inner parts with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If, however, an artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measurements be made with the cubit (span) of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with encaustum (wax), and cut up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And that which should be drawn out from the blood is 6 ounces, and perhaps you will draw more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Cut (the artery) entirely according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of the artery itself.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then, consider for the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If there remains anything towards the bone from the sifac (gristle), then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur; then stitch the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Chapter on the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or acute catarrh due to acidic moistures and warmth in the temples occurs, or an old wound, violent, and similar ones: and it is treated with methods of curative medicine, but it does not help: then we have been experienced in dealing with such ailments, extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 The method of operation for these is to shave the sick hairs that are on the temples and stretch towards the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indeed shown to you by its pulse and it rarely hides except in a few men or when there is a violent cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it hides from you, then the sick person should bind his head with any cloth of his, then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or fumigate the place with hot water until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the spatholem, which I have prepared earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then thrust a hook into it and extract it upwards until you extract it from the skin, and make it come out from all sides of the tunics that are under it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If, however, the artery is delicate: then turn it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off the part according to its length so that the ends contract and there is no blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut and if it is not separated, the blood does not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate the blood up to six ounces, down to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it should be tied in two places with strong double thread, silk or gut, or with alum-soaked threads so that putrefaction does not reach it before the wound is consolidated and there is blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off the excess, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour, or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a small cautery; until its ends are cut off and it remains in place for that same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is better work, unless if he is weak with a fever, or of cool constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is from those that help to stop wetnesses.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old clay; and lumps well-made powdered charcoal should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the solution, it is to be treated with dry medications that cause flesh to grow and with linen until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If, however, during the operation there is a bleeding from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with wax; and press your hand until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing from those present for you, then place your finger on the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And anoint the place with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides and it is bound as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the vein is lighter and easier to extract, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; and the sharpness of the two blades should be like alum.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, both freeze; and do not cut flesh with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since they have some thickness, heat is to be kept in them and the flesh is cut swiftly; whence this work is better than any other, lighter and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between two knives be of the size of a finger's thickness, after you mark two places with wax; then place both hot ones until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places: to loosen what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They will not be completely fused with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of frequent and acute tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and their course is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no treatment medicine is applied to them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person turning red, and you feel walking on the forehead as if it were the walking of ants: and the eyes are weakened, moist, so much so that the hairs on them are already corroded with corrosion: and the eyelids have been heated due to the sharpness of the tears: then, in the treatment of them, the ancients resorted to this operation, and they named it treatment, with a sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 To command the sick person to shave the hairs on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three equal cuts in the forehead, each as long as a finger, and let the length of one cut be approximately equal to the nose's length in the middle of the forehead, and the second one slightly longer than the movement of the elbow, and the third on the other side: and avoid cutting arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all cuts be the width of three connected fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared or dry cloth, with which you can squeeze blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert the sharp ends of two spatulas whose shape is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision on the temple side to the second incision: and scrape with it the entire skin that is between the two cuts, along with the flesh above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the first spatula and insert another tool called a sharp scalpel from one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 Place the sharp side facing towards the flesh attached with skin and the blunt side facing the bone; push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut along with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except that the incision should be continuous as far as it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make that [instrument] in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood flows out, squeeze the places from the vessels that are coagulated.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a linen cloth from an old oven on every fissure and put over them small pieces soaked in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And beware of developing a hot abscess.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day dissolve the ligature and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat that [area] with a basilicon ointment and the others that are used for wounds until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on treating sharp tears and catarrh of the eyes from the interior parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone experiences sharp, frequent catarrh or tears, and you see that their eyes are weakened, small, and their sight is already diminished; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is intense pain deep within the head, accompanied by sneezing: then take, among these conditions, what those materials or catarrh do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is to advise the sick one to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one cut in the middle of the forehead, or a little less wide on either side, starting from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach as far as the bone; and move your hand away from the temples that move during chewing until the bone is exposed; and dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the cut between the two lips of the wound with a heated iron or with linen rags.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then tie it above with thread; and soak the thread with wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it, and see that the abscess is about to subside: then you must break open the bone until flesh begins to grow within it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for it with a drying dressing that promotes the growth of flesh; as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare an ointment from them, which should be applied for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 [Paragraph on the treatment of an ear wound.]
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, similar to a stone such as iron and wood; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is liquid, such as water, vinegar, and similar substances; or it is some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear, or any kind of stone not growing within the ear, expose the ear alone: if therefore you see a stone, then pour something from violated oil or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer extraction of it, and make him sneeze with some snuff, and place cotton in the nostrils at the coming of the sneeze, after you put around the ear fragments from cloth or wool, and stretch the ear towards above.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For many times it goes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Genti, that is, with subtle Pizigaroli: whose shape is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If therefore it goes out with Genti, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a blind subtle hook in little repetitions.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not go out by that, then make a pipe from copper and insert the end of the pipe into the ear opening quite a lot, and plug what is around the pipe with wax softened with oil so that there is no wind path except the pipe: then draw out with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 For many times it goes out with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not go out in this way: then take from helkalimbat or from liquid, that is, prepared gluten which birds are caught with, a small amount of it: and put it at the end of the radius when you have placed a suitable cup over it: then insert it into the ear opening with ease after you have removed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not go out with all that we have said, then hurry to cut it before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of cutting is, to take an unwell person first in the head: and draw out from his blood according to its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit with you and turn his ear upward, and make a small opening at the base of the ear in the fatty part at its lowest point; let the opening be in the shape of a moon until you reach the stone; then remove it together with what is possible for you using your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then make an opening with caution and care from your side until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falls into the ear that is one of the grains which grow and swell, then administer extraction for it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out on its own, then take a thin, delicate probe of this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that species from the grains which fall into the ear and do not do this when you think that the grain is already humidified by the ear's moisture before putting it in many fragments; then remove it with forceps, or with a delicate implement, or with suction, as we said, since extraction is relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 However, when water enters the ear, the patient should use sneezing with it at first and already fill his ear with some heated old wine; and the water is lying on top of that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it comes out through this [the probe], it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if it does not: then take many small and soft stones, heat them slightly with fire, and have the patient insert one from them into the ear's opening; and salt his foot on that side and strike with another stone upon the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, do not stop doing this with stones and stones until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out in such a way that you can take one from parchment or reed and insert its end into the ear; and ignite the other end with fire until it burns as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then proceed with another syringe, and do this repeatedly until all the water comes out: and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated on the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 When extracting an animal that has entered it (if its body is small, like a flea, or similar), care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it has a large body, which can be felt by touch: then administer its extraction with forceps and curettes: and its substance is easier for all who are required to work in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what I said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help: then it is necessary to look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from worms, then extract it with forceps or subtle curettes.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula with this form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert its fine end into the ear according to the capacity that the sick person can tolerate: then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Repeat this until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you to leave (the ear), then surround the cannula with poppy seeds and beeswax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have been familiar with for killing worms: and you will find this in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your outflow be with olive oil and medications into the ear with this tool, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, with a small hole at the bottom.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 The implement within the concavity of the cannula should be made of suitable bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 Take therefore the radish, and roll its surface with an appropriate covering; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish into the cannula; let it be made of gold; then insert the heated radish tip, and press it gently with your hand until the oil in the concavity is forced out and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should already be slightly heated by fire; take care not to distill anything cold into it; for medicine does not tolerate extreme coldness.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 On the treatment of auricular impaction (Gold filling).
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes, some infants are born from their mothers' wombs without the auditory passages being pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happens to some people that an auricular impaction occurs as a result of a wound or growth within the ear.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this auricular impaction sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it occurs near the outer ear opening, and can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and is not apparent to the eye, is difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which is visible to the eye, one should place the sick person's ear on the sun and observe it; then if you see the impaction, open it with a fine spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small notch, part of which is sharp; the rest of the spatula should be made of two rounded sides to avoid damaging the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If the auricular impaction is due to a growth within the ear, then hold it with a fine tweezer and cut it out easily and forcefully until all the growth is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If there is an opening in the depth of the ear: then take thin radiation, linen, and heat it slightly with fire; afterwards send it into the ear's flesh.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you find an opening with it, when the patient is weakened by illness and deafness, attempt to open it easily; be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the hole you have made, and wrap it with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are assured that the wound is healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and immerse it in rosewater, grind zinc into powder over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already discharging pus: then take out the linen and let it dry with another piece of linen that has been wrapped in a cerotic made with rose oil, until the warm pus settles; then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding instead (of pus): then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the rest of the treatment that was mentioned for removing the blood flow, in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on treating Eyelids by Althelas.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those who occur in the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, hold them with forceps or tweezers, and cut them at their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place powdered zinc over the area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautionery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And cauterizing them is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid: They often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 § On the care of swollen eyelids.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often it happens that something similar to a swollen eyelid occurs in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called Grando; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and on the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation is to see if it is a Grando proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid, and if they move to all parts, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Make an incision therefore above it in a lengthwise direction.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape off from all sides with ease, until it reaches the end.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it down with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If, however, the cutting off of it is not prepared for you beforehand, unless you pierce the eyelid with a slight incision first, then it hurts the weak one in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the incision is large: Then join it with a stitch, and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Anointing restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If the Grando is turned towards the inner part of the ear and lies on its outer surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, and hang the Grando down with a hook; besides that, you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, no harm will come to you from it.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after the incision of the Grando with salt water; and take care of the place until it fleshes out, until the weak one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 On the treatment of swellings on the eyelids.
Caput X.	 De curatione ulceris oculi qui est
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The swelling which arises on the upper eyelid is called Axirnath, and this happens most frequently in children. It causes their eyes to become heavy, and they get cataracts in the mornings and are unable to see the light of the sun, because tears flow towards it; and for that reason you can always see them lying on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are wet under the eyebrows, which have already been covered by swelling. The appearance of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth and prepare a bandage in it. Make a circle of the bandage according to the size that contains the Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Place it on top of the bandage, and press it with your fingers on all sides to gather the Axirnath in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find a place in the middle of the wetness with a small incision, and the incision should not be larger than that which occurs in phlebotomy in deep veins.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary to make an incision through the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, because in many cases the Axirnath comes out from the opening like a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Pull it out with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed. Be careful not to add anything in the incision so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If the Axirnath is not apparent to you at the beginning of the crack, you shall add a little into the crack with ease until the Axirnath appears.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then remove it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the place, and tie it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are men who grind salt, and they place it in the hollow of the crack, so that it melts what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a boil occurs at the place, then take care of it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 [Chapter heading:] On the methods of Ataxmir for eyes, that is, when the eyelid softens so that it weeps as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the natural course of hairs and turn white, then they harm the eye and bring about symptoms such as continuous tears, softening of the eyelid, and opacity, until it leads to the cause of eye destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir indeed cures the eyes according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, as stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Ataxmir is treated by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By reeds, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You should place the head of the sick person on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is thus turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert a needle into it where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle penetrate through the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread towards the top with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula slipping from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then extract the thread, and put a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark the eyelid with pitch (encaustic), as if it were like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 Nevertheless, the figure must be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since this is varied among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who require that the amount be cut from the eyelid according to the size that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the spatula find on top of the lines that you marked, and begin from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct, and let there be a split near the natural hairs, as thick as the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scarify it entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then join the two lips with suture using a sharp needle and fine wool thread: and remove blood, and make what exceeds from the threads on the eyebrows adhere, with some things that stick to it, if you wish to do this: and if not, do not treat it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and threads for three or four days, afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, release the wound without suture, and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid should be lifted during bandaging of the wound and its dressing, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancients (Ataxmires).
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern about the patient in this procedure, but it is a good operation and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also in Ataxmires: it is to mark signs on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have told before.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then lift the eyelid with three separated or united combs according to the following shape, then cut off what is excess with small scissors according to this shape with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb and it does not fit, then take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the figure; insert another thread near the larger tear duct and another thread near the smaller tear duct; and bind threads on your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then lift your hand with an equal elevation; and lift the skin where the wound is marked, as we have told before.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind together the lips of the wound with suture and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If a boil occurs at your incision or tear, bind it with thread and pitch and similar substances from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes of the eyelid may also turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you must use what we have said in the incision; but suturing on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 On the treatment of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And turn the eyelid over, and cut the fissure that is within, as I have told you.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two canines or two thin sticks, whose length is equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a spatula; and you have already cut at both ends of each where you hold the sutures.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then attach each one to the superfluous part of the eyelid of the eye with a spatula and tie two canines from both sides with a tight knot, and let it be for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the contracted skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has consolidated, clean the eyelid and do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the form of two canines which you should make according to this figure and size.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On the removal of irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a thin needle and insert a fine silk thread into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then tie the ends of it and knot both ends with a very thin knot; and let the length of the threads be one palm (about 5 inches).
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then take another fine thread for Alinxotatis and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then place the patient's head in your lap and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be seen; since this is a delicate or fine operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with Alinxotatis into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw the needle above the aneurysm and insert it into the aneurysm; if there is one, or two, or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand along with it, until the needle emerges from the aneurysm with its own hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the aneurysm is drawn out and its own hair does not come out with it; draw the aneurysm downwards, with the thread you have inserted into it, until the aneurysm comes out through the upper opening, and you see it with your eye; then draw out the aneurysm and the thread, and pull both out, close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then take a long hair from among natural hairs and draw it along with it; or leave it until it grows out, and then draw it out when it has grown sufficiently far.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the treatment of a case that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this aneurysm happens to the eye, it is called "Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 This aneurysm may be natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental aneurysm arises from the consolidation of a wound, a cut, a cauterization, or similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of treatment for it is to find the consolidated area and separate the lips of it, and put a linen cloth inside, tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not appropriate to use medicines that dry and constrict when treating it; for if you do so, the aneurysm becomes worse than before; instead, use softening substances such as fenugreek; and embrocation with water in which althea has been boiled, with linseed; and apply daquilon ointment, which has been melted with some oil; and wrap it with linen, and treat it with that.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of care is, that thou strive with all thy skill, so that it not harden, according to the former shape that was first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation indeed, which we have said, is no more than a correction of Alzahrak, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Section on the care of Alzahrak in the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or contraction upward towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This Alzahrak which occurs below, is indeed what is truly called Alzahrak.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one is made from wound, or split, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the method of operation in it is, that you take a pointed instrument, in which there is a double thread, and you stain it in the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the flesh upwards with a point, and cut it with a broad chisel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take radium, and place it in the split, and turn the eyelid with it: and cut two splits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their extremities be at the angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they are gathered together, the shape becomes this shape, and is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh in quantity, which is its sharp edge below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather the separated parts: or her with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for those (injuries) with what we have said, regarding softening medicines and linen, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if Alxatrati occurs from a split or suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to find a flat split beneath the eyelashes, as previously described.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with linen, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the treatment for Alxatrati, whether above or below, is that the operation should be performed on it, as prepared according to the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 Indeed, it has many variations in its shape: and the skillful craftsman prepares his mind with any method that is possible for him, until he brings back the figure to a natural form or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in numerous positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 § On the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the end of a rod under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp like the edges of spatulas, but rather blunt for a short distance: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not harm the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you are scraping off that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye, rinse it with water: or distill it on him from sifted snow dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between eyelid and eye with a linen strip: and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and use after the third day or when solidified, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the incision of the nail and the protrusion of flesh from the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nerve-like and resembles a hard horn, delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nerve-like, resembling frozen wetness of white, which when struck with iron or attempted to be picked up with a nail, is broken off and the nail does not embed in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither of these types begin except from the larger tear duct, until it gradually enters, covering the eye, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation in its incision is that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of him and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then grasp the nail with a few-times folded nails and extend it towards the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert it into the nail with a horse's, cow's or sheep's hair, and make sure it is thin; bend the tip of the needle slightly and pierce it through the middle of the nail and tie the nail with thread and extend it towards the upper part; and scrape the side of the nail following the pupil as if you were pulling it with hair up to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small forceps; and let the natural flesh of the tear duct remain, so that no continuous flow of tears occurs from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a forceps alone; or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And beware, lest the spatula touch the nail's cornified layer and cause a break there, and the hole is punctured through.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt or made of wine vinegar into the eye and let it remain for another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it as necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not nerve-filled and you cannot insert an awl into it nor does a forceps fit into it, then this kind of nail is repeatedly treated with medications and heals as I narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it (the nail), then open the eye of the patient and take a delicate, soft, fragile and sharp spatula in the following shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And grind the nail above with a fine file.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is becoming rarefied and crushed and a file has been pressed into it, then pour from your hour into the eye vinegar made of wine vinegar or red vinegar or ground salt and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the procedure until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is a warm abscess in the eye, then leave that alone and care for the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure with a file until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 The protrusion of the eyelid flesh (chalazion), if it causes great harm in the eye, is suspended with a forceps and cut from it; not too close to the incision so as not to disrupt the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then apply milk or red colocynth (or one made from zinc), until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 On eye-lid incision and flesh born therein.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter Seventeen.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 There arises sometimes in the eyes of men a red flesh, either composed or laid over, until it covers the pupil or approaches or presses upon the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles the rose of Balaustium.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for this is also that the weak one should put his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and collect the entire flesh with suitable forceps; and hold it with a single forcep or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until you finish it all with the knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to hurt the eye during the operation; and let your cut, when you make it, be as we described in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, such as those used for cauterizing the asebel (a type of wart), according to its shape after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your cut is completed and all the alguardenic (the red flesh) is removed, then fill the eye with brine; or sprinkle in it red powder and similar substances from corrosive medicines; and place over the outer eye a piece of warm cotton with white egg: to protect it from hot inflammation.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some of the alguardenic remains and you are dominated by hot blood, and fear a hot inflammation; then let go of the eye and take care of it with what soothes the inflammation.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation over him until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do the same with any additional flesh that may occur in the eye of this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 It is necessary that every weak eye of an alien, whether from a natural or accidental cause, be treated with iron in surgery: and you shall not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that this member is able to bear such operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on the collection of Sebel (Seba) from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Chapter XVIII.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is necessary for you first, that you consider whether the eye in which is Sebel, is strong and there is no sickness in it except Sebel; then collect Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is that you command the weak to place his head in your armpit.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend the veins with one or two needles according to your discretion; and let the needle be subtle in doubling, according to this shape, or let there be two needles graduated in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect the veins with subtle forceps and remove the blood by the hour after the hour until you see the veins removed from the eye and resolved; and beware lest you harm the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation; so that you do not cut except the veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then distill into the eye whether green or red; so that with its own sharpness it may burn what remains from Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If however it is not possible for you to collect all of this in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which relieves the pain of the eye; and leave it for some days until the pain subsides; and secure it from infection with warm covers; then repeat on it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter: On reducing Arissat to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The surgeon is named Arisato. He cures a fistula with a cautery or with sharp medicine burning, according to the account that preceded it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it is not cured (the fistula), then there is no skill in it: except to lance over the abscess at its birth, and extract all moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone is exposed, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with the instrument, which has this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called the rasp of the skull.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron india, and its head should be round like a razor, which is pierced with a file, or pierced with the fine point of aliskilfer: and place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it with your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption is already scraped away: do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with dry medicines made of styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows in it, and the course of pus stops: and remains forty days, and does not renew, and does not abscess, and no accident occurs in it: then you will know that it is already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to lead the fistula back to the nostril, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is to scrape the bone in the second joint with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this shape, the tip of which is iron, triangular: and the wood of it should be a pyramid extended to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels weak. By this you will know that air is coming out of it, when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Then restore the place with medicines drying, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and the place hardens; then the matter that flowed outward, returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter above the sick man.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Eyelid Protrusion.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye bulges completely and no harm or reduction occurs in vision: then it is necessary to release the patient; afterwards, apply leeches to him; subsequently, place blisters on the neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then apply a liniment on the eye which is made from acacia, aloe, myrrh and pitch resin.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then tighten the eyelid above with plaster containing many small fleas.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of fleas is as follows: you should take soft cloths in large quantities and fold each cloth four times; make many from them; then place one on top of another according to how much the eye needs; then tighten them with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the application of blisters with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the blisters and allow the eyelid to remain closed during day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to tighten it a lot; afterwards, remove the bandage after day and night as previously mentioned.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see the eye returning to its normal appearance, that is good; otherwise, repeat the plaster, fleas, tightening and blisters until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 [Paragraph on] Incision of the conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When there is a rupture in the tunica Vuea, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of Vua, and the human form is disfigured by it; and it is to be cut: then surgery on it is necessary, as I have said; and it is that you insert the point of the knife into the root of Vua from below to its upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another point (of the knife) where there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; then release the first point according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with a suture around the root of Vua; and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the point (of the knife), and place a moistened wool on the white of the eye; and let it remain until the thread with Vua falls off.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of the eye with whatever comforts it until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes tie off Vua on all sides with a circle made of cloth until the eye protrudes significantly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then puncture it with a fine spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisten the white of the eye; let it sink and enter immediately; then tie it up until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Chapter on the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This ailment called Alcomnat is nothing but pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending from it, and it is not the same.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of treatment for this is that you make the patient sit on a prepared chair or straight chair.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take hold of his head with both hands from the sides and move him until you see pus come out towards the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is shaped and does not descend, and the vision is cleared; let the patient see as he did before; and if it does not descend towards the lower part, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If, however, no preparation for the descent of pus is made as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probangue and puncture it with it slightly on the horny pad near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane at the corona, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water boiled with burned hay and honey; then cleanse with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 On the care of the water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the kind of water suitable for division and expulsion, then take it accordingly in health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then you should make the patient sit with his head between your hands square and facing the light, near the sun; bind the healthy eye, and squeeze it tightly; then close the eyelid of the affected eye with your right hand if the water is in the left eye; or your left hand if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take with your right hand the almudga (a type of plant) if the water is in the left eye; or take with your left hand if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of the almudga near the corona (cornea) through the thickness of a radial ray on the visible part of the white sclera appearing at the lacrimal sac; then push the almudga with force and you rotate your hand along with it, until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye; and feel that the almudga has already reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the length of the journey of the almudga to the depth is the measurement of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You shall observe it indeed within the very pupil vision of the eyes, due to the clarity of the cornea's coat.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the almudga up to the place where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it downwards with one blow after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore water goes down immediately, then the sick person sees it directly on what opens his sight immediately, and almudga in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then you rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If therefore water goes down, then you remove it with the second, beyond the exit of the almudga.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is pressed and does not rise up: then you remove the almudga with ease; and you turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then you dissolve something from clear salt in water; and wash the eye with it inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside of the eye the whole mop of wool soaked in rose oil and white egg: and bind with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, as well as those who are of our time, place chamomile pulverized with egg white on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the almudga does not obey you to enter into the eye due to its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard; then it is necessary that you take a spatula called Alberid, which has this form:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore bore with it only the conjunction itself, and not the end of your hand into the hole; and there is no other than to make a subtle way to the almudga place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the almudga, as we said before.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 In addition to the performance of your work, it should be prepared for the sick a bed well made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house; and let him be kept away from all movements, and from coughing; and put food for him that calms his nature; and do not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the ligature be according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then unbind it in that dark room and test its sight; make it see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then return the ligature until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it should not be done during the hour of cure, or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be done by another because water rises quickly through an intense opening.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If however a hot abscess occurs: then it should be unbound before the seventh; and correct it with what soothes the abscess until it is soothed; then without its sight, place over its oral opening that which regulates its vision for some days, while it remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then gradually leave the house and change into his own clothes.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that the student is not exempted from observation several times; then he shall dare on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 Now indeed one of those from Alayrach has come to us who said that a perforation was made in Alayrach's stomach, through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who did that; nor have I read it in any of the old books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the shapes of the incisions from the Maghda (operation), for them who do not know about it to stand on them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them of bronze; and let their ends be with this same subtle trangularity, and the end sharp.
Formae magda.	 The Maghda shapes.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on the treatment of a newborn's flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Whenever diverse fleshes are born in the nose, some of which resemble the many feet of a scorpion: and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, dark colored: and from it is the gentle flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for that gentle flesh which is among those fleshes, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you must make the sick person sit with his face opposite the sun and open his nostrils; then thrust a hook into those fleshes; afterwards drag them towards the outside and cut what you have grasped from it with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains of it from whose removal is not possible: then shave that with a small instrument easily, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If however blood dominates over you or a hot boil occurs: then apply to it as required; or if it is from malicious boils, then quickly proceed with cauterizing it until the blood separates and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after cutting.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If however the nose opens and moisture goes up to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If however the moisture does not penetrate as required, then you know that there is flesh born within the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with cutting.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then you must insert a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots; and place between every knot an amount equal to the length of a finger or less; and let the sick person thrust one end of the thread into his nose with a rod, or with whatever he can manage after making it similar to a syringe: and pull out the smelly stuff until it reaches the cavity, and goes out above the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many times do boys in schools perform this, and it is an easy matter for him who desires.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the cord, one that exits through the nose, and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then, with a pair of scissors or a knife, cut the flesh along with the knots that are on the cord.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now separated from the knots of the cord.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the cord; place linen moistened with Egyptian ointment in the nose after bleeding has stopped. Do this for three days or more until the ointment has completely corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place a lead tube at the end in the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If, however, it requires a dry cure, use this method.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the purge to be made with oil and other medications into the nose, make it of silver or copper; it should resemble a small lamp, open like a snail shell, and its passage should also be similar.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, as in a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the snail shell instrument for the purge should be filled and perforated; it should have a handle at its end with which to hold it while heating oil or whatever you wish from infusions and fluid substances within it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the cure of a deviated nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 A deviated nose, known as a Thelul, often arises at the end of the nose and grows larger with days until it becomes an ugly sight.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 Therefore, when it first appears, cut it off completely at its base.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot, either cautery, or a medicine burning at its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the incision does not widen, then consider if it is hard and black, with few senses; then do not touch it with iron because it is cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For I have often seen one who made an incision in a tumor and great evil happened to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the tumor is soft and not black, and you see that it is possible to make an incision in its entirety, then evacuate the weakened part and incise it without fear or timidity; and care for the place with it as it exudes and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Chapter on stitching the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a loosening of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation does not help much unless in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore when something happens to anyone of these, you should examine if it is a recent wound with its blood; and then gather two pieces of the wound together with stitches; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if there is a loosening of continuity in the lips and they are already separated, and each part has become healthy; then it is necessary to remove all parts appearing from the skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then gather two lips with stitches, tie them and sprinkle powder of dragon's blood and pulverized aloes over the bleeding; then place a piece of ointment plaster called diafinicon on top of the powders, and another piece of any consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then loosen it, change the medicine; and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to gather the solution of continuity or with needles, as we have explained in the suturing of the abdomen; or gather the solution with thread, as I have shown you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many men happen to have hard lesions on the inside of their lips, similar to grains of grass; some of them are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip, find on top of every node of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the cut with wax, until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is rubbed with vinegar and the place where there is an inflammation is treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on cutting the flesh of a child over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often, flesh grows on the gum which is called 'abulus' by the ancients.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and let the pus run out or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place wax on the spot or other healing powders over it.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh comes back after treatment, which often happens, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not come back after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on grinding teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Whenever abscesses form on the surface of teeth from both the inside and outside parts, and between the gums and hard enamel, they sometimes turn black, become citrine-colored, or green, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul due to this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore, you must make the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and shave the tumor and tooth, where the cortex appears to you, and something similar to sand remains until there is nothing left; and similarly do with blackness, and greenness, and yellowish, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If what is in them is removed from the beginning by reason, that is good; but if not, then repeat the razing upon them on another day, the second, and the third, until at last the study comes to an end in that which you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires razors of various shapes and forms, according to which it is prepared for your operation; because the razor with which the tooth is shaved from the lower part is different from the razor with which the tooth is shaved between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of the razors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you treat the tooth from its pain with all diligence and to delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not possible to replace it when it is extracted; because its substance is lofty; until there is no excuse for extracting it, then if the sick person must be compelled to extract it himself, it should be strengthened and certified by you that the tooth in pain.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often the sick person is deceived by pain and thinks that it is in the tooth and extracts it himself; then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the sick person is certified by you that the tooth in pain is himself, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gums are loosened from all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate tweezers in the first place gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place the large forceps in those places well, and hold the head of the weak between your knees so that it remains still; then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill the hole with a cloth and tighten it with the tip of a thin radius so as not to break it during your extraction with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 It is necessary that you perform careful scarification around the gums on all sides in many places.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And be mindful of your strength so as not to break it and a part of it remains and returns over the weak one from that greater evil which is its original pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware that you do not make the same mistake as those who are ignorant in their haste and audacity during extraction, and instead administer what I have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they make great illnesses come upon men, which are difficult to break and all of whose roots remain or some of them; or extract it with some jaw bones, as we have often testified to this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then after extraction, it is washed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If bleeding occurs from the places (for it often happens), then grind some wax and fill the place with it; if not, cauterize it if you do not have wax.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved should be long at the end and short at the grip, thick so as not to split when it is pressed against the tooth; they should be like the grips of large forceps, until when you tighten them, they do not bite themselves, nor split; the ends should be short and made of iron or well-made file, straight at the ends; and in their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into others and tighten with a decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes [there are] extremities like the shape of a bird's beak, which is called ciconia, and [they are] strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 On the extraction of teeth, and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains at the site of tooth extraction that breaks, then it is necessary to place warm butter on the spot for one or two days until the location softens; afterwards, introduce algasti, or forceps, whose tips are similar to the beak of a bird called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is the shape of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The tips of them are made like a file inside out; or like an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out of you with these forceps, then it is necessary to carve a cavity over the root and peel off all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called Palanca parva, whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let the tip be short and slightly thicker; and not soaked, lest it breaks.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with other instruments whose shapes are as follows.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first one is a triangle with a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the thin triangle tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helpful is this instrument with two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which have been mentioned for tooth extraction.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also helpful is this instrument resembling a large nail with a twisted triangle tip and some thickness, so as not to break; and it should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many tools for teeth; and likewise, the rest of the instruments are not mentioned; but a prudent and skillful craftsman finds for himself the tool according to the operation and diseases indicated by them.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because there are diseases for which no ancient instrument was found, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If however a bone from the jaw, or any bone of the face, breaks or putrefies: then examine over it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned for extraction of roots, and assist with the device whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let something of thickness gradually be placed within it to tighten or hold the bone, so that it does not flee and move away, until the bone is expelled; then restore the place with appropriate medications for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape it away from its decay, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the suture of prominent teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it becomes ugly due to that shape; and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely in the soft ones.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should examine.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and it does not settle, or its suture, nor cutting of it is possible; then extract it: and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it with this tool, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak, and it is made of iron with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that you make the cut over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it protrudes for suture cutting: then cut it with a file made of iron, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle small with many sharp points, like a file used to make a needle; with which you should gently file the tooth little by little over many days, so that another tooth is not disturbed and it falls out; then smooth it, in the end scrape it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth, from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that the edge be smoothed out until its roughness is removed, and it becomes level; and it should be flattened so as not to injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 On the extraction of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there occurs a shock or jolt to the front teeth from being struck or by accident, and the weak person cannot hold what he eats to prevent it from falling out; and you have treated them with medicinal poultices, but the treatment has not been effective: then it is appropriate that they be fastened with a gold thread, since silver becomes green and putsrefies after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the thread be of a medium thickness between fineness and coarseness according to its quantity that it may hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the extraction is such that you take the thread and insert it double between two healthy teeth; then you wind it with its two ends between the moved teeth, whether one or several, until you reach the sutures up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then wind it again up to the part from which you began; and hold your hand with finesse and wisdom until it is not removed entirely; and let your pressure when you tighten the thread be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the excessive ends of the thread with scissors; and collect both, and twist them together; and conceal these beneath the healthy tooth and the moved tooth so as not to injure the tongue; then let it be tightened until it remains in that state.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it loosens or breaks, fasten it with another thread, and it will remain in that state for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of grinding of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return to their places after the loss of each (tooth), and remain as we have said; and this does not occur unless the skilled and experienced craftsman makes it happen.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth is shaped from the bones of a cow; and it is made like the form of a tooth, and placed in its position, so that it is strengthened and held firm as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 § On the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 When this ligament that happens under the tongue is natural, because it is born with man, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation in it is to open the weak bone in its head in your pouch and lift up its tongue; then cut that nerve-ligament through its width until it is disconnected from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then thrust an awl into it, and bore through its width until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware, lest there be a cleft in deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is to be lapped up with water of rose, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place under the tongue a piece of linen cloth which the sick man holds all night so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is bleeding, then place over the place a piece of mustard seed powder.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If blood conquers you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery which is suitable for it; then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the extraction of the ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Occasionally there occurs under the tongue a boil resembling a small frog, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function and perhaps it swells so much that it fills the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation in it is to open the weak bone before the sun: and observe the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore you see it of a black or dark color, hard, in which no unhealthy sensation is found: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 If it is hollowed out towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw in a hook and cut it with a fine chisel and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 And if your blood is constrained by it during your operation hour, then place a gauze soaked in vinegar upon it until the blood is removed; thereafter return to your operation until you extract it with its appendage.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Thereafter it is washed with vinegar and salt; care for it with the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of two cysts (abscesses).
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever cysts (abscesses) resembling boils occur in the throat, that is, swellings that occur outside; and they are called the two Amigdalae: which, when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If therefore it is a hard abscess, of dark color, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and the root of it is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing bleeding, but rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And thereafter either perforate it or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 If it is white in color, round and the root of it is subtle: then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is to consider before its operation whether the abscess has become quiet and warm with complete rest, or whether it decreases somewhat: then have the patient sit facing the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth and receive a servant between his hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Make it from silver, or brass, that it may be as subtle as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press it with your tongue and the boil is shown to you, and falls before your eyes: then take a hook, and pierce it in the middle, and pull it out as far as possible, besides pulling some of the skin along with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles forceps; but its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in the direction of the other's point; take care therefore that it is made of steel or brass impregnated with aluminum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Be sharp at one end, not sharp at the other end.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you cut one acorn (boil), cut the other according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the cutting, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there should be a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled; or the leaves of myrtle, and similar ones from other herbs, until the flow of blood is removed: then take care of him, until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than acorns (boils) arise in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, cut them according to what I said about the cutting of two acorns equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have healed a woman from a boil that was born in her throat, which was dragging towards the flesh, and only a few senses remained, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow mouth, and she had already prohibited her from eating, and drinking water: and by now it had come close to death, if it had lasted one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The wound or sore had risen to such an extent that it expelled two branches, until they emerged through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore hastened and fastened a hook onto one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came away with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Afterwards, I cut off the remaining part where it was seized in the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to the other what had come out from the second nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I fastened a hook onto the sore; afterwards I cut off a part of it, and nothing more came out except a little blood; so the woman's throat was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, and afterward took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not cease to cut from that sore repeatedly for a long time; and the sore would follow wherever I was cutting, until it became too prolonged, and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I then heated an iron and cauterized the sore in the woman's throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 She then remained well; afterwards I went away, and I did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 [Section heading: On the incision of a sore in the throat.]
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a catarrh descends to the throat and a sore forms, which is large; it is then called perpendicular; and if it is round and thick in the lower part, it is then called a goitre (gland).
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what I have said in the previous division, and there is no improvement; and you see that the sore is warm and soft; then it should be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if what is gathered around it is round and not long, and is red or blackish or dark in color, and there is no feeling; then it should be cut.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 There is fear concerning the sick one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it as I have said from its whiteness and its length, so that you make the sick one sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the story has gone before: then fasten a hook in his wound, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of two instruments which I said for incising two amygdala.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut from it more, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the cutting, use what we have said for the incision of two amygdala; and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the sick one fears cutting: then it is necessary that you use cunning for his cauterization without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the method of cauterizing it is not unless with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the sick one on your breast.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument which I said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I said to you in the chapter of cauterizing, and fashion a ladle with it not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the depression of this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 The cavity where medicine is placed should be concave, like the cavity of a cochlea's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument along with the medicine upon the ulcer itself: and let the sick man lie on his side, so that the salve may run from his mouth due to the internal medicine, so that nothing may fall from it into his throat, and thus harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply it to the ulcer by handfuls for half an hour until you see it become darkened and the bite of the medicine subside.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to apply a poultice, you wrap it around the extremity of the radius and pour the poultice with medicine, then insert the radius with the poultice into the cannula until the poultice sticks to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this repeatedly, until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let it go: for it burns and falls away within three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cauterization, clean the area around the vein with a poultice soaked in butter and make it clean with that which is around it from the medicine; and wipe it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 Externally it is to be treated with embrocation, and internally with gargarisms, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier than incision and less fearful.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes an ulcer is also treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision: it is treated with suffumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take camphor, hyssop, origanum, rutus, asafoetida, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs: and grind them all together or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil: the pot should be well coated with lime: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it from silver or copper, and introduce the tip, where the grain is, into the sick man's bone, until the vapor reaches the wound through the cannula, until the ulcer becomes much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat over it many times, until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess's onset.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Generally, add in abscess: and it is not proper to do this unless at the cooling down of that abscess's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this tool is not present to you, then take a reed, and prepare the rind of an egg on its tip so that the bone does not burn because the eggshell rind prevents the heat from burning the bone; and this is good treatment with benefit.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on the extraction of thorns, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fish spine adheres to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, you should remove what appears from among them that lies beneath the vision, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is revealed to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make a weakened man vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps the thing attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the weakened man swallows a piece of nutmeg or radish root or a dry bread crumb, or takes a piece of dried sea sponge, softens it and ties it to a thread; then he swallows that.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the thorns or bones are and they are being removed, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out with what has been said, then use a lead tool in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 The object should be thicker than the radius slightly, and at its end there should be an opening, which can easily pass through the throat; and it should have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him be careful of touching his epiglottis to avoid a cough and push with it a bone or a splinter, or introduce it himself with his hand (the instrument).
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But if the patient introduces it (the object), this is better, because of his knowledge about the place where it is attached; and he should push downward or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all that according to its quantity which is prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with what I said about its division in the cure with medicines and it does not work, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun or after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your vision falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine forceps.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If this is not possible with them (the fine forceps), then take a concave tube, insert it into the throat of the sick person as far as the throat; then insert into the concavity of the tube hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Repeat this often: and let the sick person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take cold water rinse and open his mouth in it; and wash his throat with it and do not swallow anything from it; move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For a leech, as soon as it feels water, it falls out.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what we mentioned, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs or with camphor with the instrument that I told you about for the fumigation of the windpipe.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Repeat it frequently, because it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The method of suffumigation is to take the pot containing live prunes with fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, having a hole in its middle; and arrange the end of the instrument in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then cast the suffumigation and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the suffumigation does not escape before you know that the suffumigation has reached the bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the bloodsucker will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat the suffumigation frequently.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the patient endure thirst, eat salt and other things, but drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary for him to come out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is extracted from the throat when it falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you see; except that it has this curvature which penetrates into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called ciconia, which has the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not release it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 [Chapter: On opening abscesses, and their cutting, and treatment in general.]
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL (40).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to the memory of them, that is one and one in this book; and they are various in their perforation, and cutting of themselves from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is of the species of an abscess on itself, and because it encompasses moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method is due to places, where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an abscess happening on the head is one thing, and an abscess happening in the anus is another: and an abscess happening in a fleshy place is another from an abscess happening in joints: and each of them has its own judgement according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from abscesses there are some that it is not necessary to perforate, unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and there are those that it is necessary to perforate, while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Like abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because when an abscess happens near a joint, and extends to be its length, until it putrefies that which is around it perhaps corrupts ligaments or the nerves of that joint's union; therefore it is a cause closer to the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or is an abscess near the main part of the body; because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either him or through that main part of the body.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, perforate it while it is immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply and spread to the inside of the anus, and become a fistula, or become at its end that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of the abscess, when it has matured according to its completion: and it is in sedation of pain, recovery of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulse, and acuteness of headache of the abscess; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 It is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and of more prominent protrusion: and let the perforation extend along the body's length, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of arms, shoulders, tendons, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which reflect, proceed with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to our completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Since if you perforate it beforehand, the course of the pus is extended from it, and there are many filths and dirtiness, and perhaps its opening hardens and deepens.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses should be perforated according to the width of the body due to necessity, or according to that limb which it needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary to make a small perforation for small abscesses and a large one for large ones: or many sections according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are abscesses in which the skin should be concaved: and it should be cut when it has become like a cloth, and made into an end, which is already dead; just as what happens with many of them, that they bubble, and with buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And there are those which should be cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And there is one of them, from which it is cut as the shape of the leaf of the myrtle tree.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And there are those in which a round incision or crescent-shaped incision is administered, and similar ones by sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 What has no head, such as are the soft ulcers, should be pierced through with a shallow puncture, or only superficially.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 It is necessary that when an abscess is large and has collected much pus, you pierce it so that it does not spread and you extract all the pus at once; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then the abscess should be opened until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then, extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this frequently according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man decrepitus: for the animal spirit often dissipates with the exit of pus; and perhaps the weak one will die, and you will not receive payment.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 After your puncture, by which you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound; and reflect.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If then the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is plain, then apply linen cloths, or an old bandage.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 If the abscess is large and there are many cracks from the puncture, then you must insert linen into every crack until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 If in the abscess you have cut off a part of the skin, or hollowed out its circumference; then it is necessary that you fill it with an old bandage, or as when fabric is woven or flax is combed without wetness; and bind it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cast it out, and care for it with whatever is necessary from the salve until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If blood flow occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked in them; and place it over the site of the blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen, treatment, and powders which I have mentioned in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the place of the boil contains many nerves: then it is necessary to pour hot poultices with wine and oil onto those areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary to place cold poultices that have been soaked in water, oil, or wine and oil, and let it all be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to dissolve the boil, remove it, and administer treatment for its healing until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, this is what is essential for the universal knowledge of treating boils.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the way of distinguishing, I have already said about every boil, how the pathway for its healing is discussed individually in chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on cutting boils that occur on the head skin.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small boils that occur on the head skin are of the types of knots contained by layers like small bags; as if they were inflated with chicken pus.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 They are fat ones: and there are those that contain a moisture similar to mud: and those that contain a moisture similar to soap and poultices: and others like them, and there are hard stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the cutting of all of them, and their removal, there is no fear, as long as it does not make an opposition to the artery during its cutting.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in their cutting is to try it out with a tool whose shape comes after this, which is called the Probe, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 If it contains moisture, then dry it by making a cut along its length with a surface incision: in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Begin with an incision along line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then remove the scab that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything beneath it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it returns if anything remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt. Fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For what remains of the scab will corrode itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over the wound with the second Egyptian ointment, and the third, and as often as necessary until you are confident that nothing remains from the scab. At this point care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If an abscess contains a thick knot: then cut it open in this manner, making an incision with the shape of a cross; and place probes between the divisions of the incision, and scrape off all the scab from every side; and try your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 But if it opposes an artery, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly for an abscess that is a stone, cut it open and treat it the same way as we said for the others.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Cutting into an abscess that is a stone is easier since there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes these types of abscesses are found in the head in some humans, where there is no moisture deep within them.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I made an incision over an abscess in the head of a very old woman, and found the abscess to be as hard as a solid stone, rough, white, that could not be broken; and if someone struck it with a probe, they would injure themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other kinds of boils occurring in the head, except for those boils that occur on children's heads and at the roots of ears, section of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Always perform perforation from the lower part of them to ease the flow of pus towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then, take care of it with whatever is appropriate for its cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on the incision of Goiter.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These boils occur frequently in the neck, under the chin and groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And above those that occur in the neck are one and many; and they originate from each other; and every goiter among them is within its proper tunica, as is the case with nodes and boils of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And the types of these goiters are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For there are among them those that are like stones; and there are those that contain moisture; and there are malignant ones, which do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In the good disposition that is visible among those of these goiters, which has a clear color close to the skin and moves towards every part and is not attached with nerves of the neck, nor with the glands, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: it should be cut off by superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line b-line g and scrape it from all sides; and open two flaps of skin with a scalpel or with several scalpels if needed, as we have said in boils of the head, and slowly remove it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is advisable to be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 The spatula should not be very sharp: so that it does not cut your hand during the incision, or disturb the sick one, and you make an incision where it is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or an artery, it prevents you from operating, then place in the wound a piece of zegi crushed, or certain powders that dissolve blood, and tie up the wound, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft: or if it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For the blood is dissolved with the tunica (linen), so return to your operation when you have finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask your index finger if there remains anything of the Strophulus (small pieces), so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein at the root of the Strophulus (small piece), then it is necessary that you do not cut the Strophulus from its root: but rather tie it with a strong double thread and leave it alone until it falls out without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with an old linen that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of him.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the whole Strophulus is cut, then it is necessary that you gather together the lips of the wound: and sew it immediately, after you see that there remains no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains an excess due to the size of the Strophulus, then it is necessary that you go to cut the root of it and pull it out: and administer the stitch as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains moisture from the Strophuli, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that you see the place of maturity of it: and place the perforation below, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 After perforation, administer linseed with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains from corruption, until you see the wound already cleaned: then take care of it with regenerative flesh ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 Section of the epiglottis due to an ulcer within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this section of the epiglottis and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those with synanchysis (swallowing difficulties), it is necessary to avoid the section of the epiglottis, since it does not provide any benefit; because all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot ulcer in the mouth, throat, or both salivary glands, when there is no illness in the channel (canal), it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis to avoid destruction caused by swelling.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to section the epiglottis, it should be done under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section along its width, in that which is between two circles by quantity; this location is suitable for sectioning, since it lacks muscle and blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is afraid, then it is necessary that he spreads the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then make an incision in the skin until you reach the channel; avoid blood vessels if you see any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then section the sifac as we have said; it is indicated by the mucus that comes out of the channel along with what breaks and the separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 Let the open wound heal at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the fear of inflammation arises, bring together two pieces of wound skin, and if possible only the skin without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medications that make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Thus ends the discourse we have narrated, its explanation is only when they see that one of these abscesses has already opened up the throat of the sick person: and he is raised up above death, and desires to be cut; they go to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound site with a certain breathing, and save himself from death: and for this reason they commanded to let the open wound heal, until the malice of the disease is consumed, and the malice is three days long, as if it were itself: then they commanded to sew up the wound, and care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I saw myself was that a maidservant received a knife and sent it into her throat, and she cut a part of the windpipe with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was summoned to treat her, and found her groaning, as is the groan of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 I then tore open the wound and found that blood had come out from the wound, though not much.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Thus I was reassured that she had not severed the vein or artery; and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 Therefore I approached and sewed up her wound, and treated it until she was well: and nothing happened to the maidservant except a hoarseness of voice; and she returned after a few days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Thus I say: that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 On the section of hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It is according to two modes: for it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural one certainly it is not a birthmark.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one is according to two modes, of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode, is similar to an abscess that comes from a knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear in it, and it should not be presumed upon with the iron, unless in that which is small; and you test it, and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty knot and not suspended with any of the veins; then cut it, as knots are cut; and extract it along with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in the cyst; and if not, then examine its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with what is required from the cure, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on the section above the knots.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their species in division; and it is necessary that here the difference between a knot and an abscess be explained, since there is a doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore I say that when an abscess is hot and feverish, and intense pains, until the ebullition of superfluity is suppressed and putrefaction is completed; then indeed fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But a knot is not hotness nor fever, nor pains; and it contains them in a kist or sac, which is their own proper bag, and it is according to the color of the body; and its origin is as a chickpea, and it is made like a grape, and greater or lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are according to two species: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a knot, you must try it and inquire about it first with the instrument that is called Intromissum, according to its form as it will come in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of examination for boils and all knots is to receive this instrument and insert it into the moist place that you find in the boil: and you rotate your fingers with it slowly until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then lay your hand upon it according to the measure of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then extract the Intromissum, and observe what comes out following its trail.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If moisture flows out running, regardless of its color: then cut it off with a superficial incision, as I have said regarding the other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if no moisture flows out following the trail of the Intromissum: then you know that it is fatty: cut off over it with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and hang it up with tongs, and strip off the skin from all sides easily: and guard the kistin if possible above it, so that you extract the healthy one along with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the kistin bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract the healthy one: then extract it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if something remains little or much from it, the knot returns most of all.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it overwhelms you and something remains little: then fill the wound at the completion, with certain corrosive powders: and tie the wound, and place on top of it what sits the boil, warm: and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore it is a large knot, then its two lips, and care for it with that which adheres to it because it has become flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is a pulsating vein that is opposite you or if it is not pulsating: then be careful, and fill the place with boiled wine and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound rots and the boiling of blood subsides; then return to cut what remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 [Paragraph on the tools for cutting and piercing from outside.]
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Among these (instruments) there are forms of those to be inserted, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 One of them is large, one of them is medium, and one of them is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make it from iron with square ends correctly, so that it fits snugly into the aperture.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of those who experiment (or perforate), and one of them is called "beris," that is, piercing; and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 One of them is large, one of them is medium, and one of them is small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are used to probe openings for fistulas, draining wounds, and boils from what is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round, smooth, blunt, like large needles for which seats are made, namely from citron or brass, bronze, iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Better ones among them are those made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 Also experimenting instruments are made of black lead, which are used to probe the concave part of the fistulas whose reflections are reflected back with their smoothness.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are three kinds again.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because among them are long, medium and short, according to the size of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 Form of Unguents, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Since they are simple (meaning single in action), that is, those which have one cure, and there are three species as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And from them (unguents) are blind unguents; and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And from them (unguents) are unguents having two cures; and there are three species. Also from them are unguents having three cures, and there are three species. All of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 These are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and tumors are cut and scabbed; and there are three species, because there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The ends of those by which cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp; they are not placed thus except for the purpose of providing help in scabbing knots near the fear of vein or nerve incision, and to heal the weakened and find some relief from the pain that is found during scabbing of tumors.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are large ones (scalpels), and there are three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of iron, and are similar to the rod with which alcohol is made; and at one end there is a hidden spout (or small opening); and within it runs (the fluid) both to the inner parts and to the outer parts whenever desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of spouts hidden between the fingers during the perforation of tumors; these are not perceived by the weakened; and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 Forms of wind-pipes with which the flow of blood is cut; and there are three species, large ones, medium ones, and small ones.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make round from copper or brass, slightly smaller in length as you see, and make them subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 These shapes of the veins at your place should be large and small: to cut blood quickly when necessary, and then when you are not present with medicine.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them in cutting blood at any part of the body, nor do you use them except on fleshy places: such as arms, legs, hips, shoulders, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar to these, from fleshy places that are moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made from these into small instruments resembling fists, according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or incision of a vein, or an artery; and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 [Section Title] Care for the Breasts in Men Similar to Women's Breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to become dirty in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain putrid afterwards.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever dislikes that [swelling], it is necessary to cut the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Fill the wound with a healing ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then attach two lips of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast droops to the lower part and softens due to its size, as it happens with women: then it is necessary to make an incision in both of its upper sides with two crescent-shaped cuts similar to this shape, one containing the other at the ends so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin between the two lips, remove the fat, and administer what I said about stitches and powders that are necessary for healing until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If, however, you do not close the incision as required for you to cut, due to the restlessness of the sick, or due to blood flow: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a cothorned plaster soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it consumes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Cure it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the Perforation of an Apostema, which happens under the Titillicus (testicle).
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These apostematas that happen under the Titillicus are of the types of Strophulas (abscesses), which contain cysts and those that contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those that contain moistures should be cut by a lunar section according to this form, from line b to line g. When everything inside the apostema has been evacuated through pus, then fill it with old plaster and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the old plaster, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the apostema is of the type of nodular Strophulas (abscesses), then cut it through as we have said in the section on Strophulas equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends such that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we have said in what has been mentioned before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 On the Section of an Apostema due to an Artery and a Vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery ruptures and the skin above it consolidates, it often happens that an apostema forms there; and similarly, a vein may also rupture, causing an apostema and inflation to form in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is recognized that an apostema and inflation are due to an artery or a vein are as follows: when the apostema is due to an artery, it is long and clustered deep in the body; and when you press the apostema with your fingers, it feels as if there is a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And what is for the Vein, is round in obvious body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And the incision over this abscess is an error, and especially what is under armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of body; and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, care must be taken with iron in its treatment, and what is also in the extremities or head, care must be taken there as well.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Over that which is from the inflation of the opening of the Artery, pierce through the incision in length on the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with forceps, then the Artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert under it a point and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the Artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then puncture the place that is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall; then care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is from an incision of a Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a point under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread in it until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind the abscess with a good ligament; according to what I told you in the ligature of a vein, with two parts and two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another point with another thread under the entire abscess near the incision; press, and bind your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is inside: then cut the redundancy of the skin, and release what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place on top of the boil that you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment which is made with linen cloths and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter on abscess occurring from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Book of the Head.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an abscess occurs in an artery or vein, so it occurs in nerves: which occurs in them by a blow, or it occurs from excessive labor and similar things: and it happens most often in places assisting the bones (or joints), or heels, and in any place where the joints are moving: and the abscess is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles its color to the rest of the body and is found in several positions without pain: and when it is compressed with violence, it feels weak, like a faintness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the abscess is not gathered deep within the body, rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part: and it does not reach forward or backward, neither towards the front nor towards the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is found in the joints, therefore, should not be invaded with an iron tool.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps there will be contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 But in that which is found in the head or forehead, puncture the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then tie it with a hook and scour it: then remove it, and pack the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Chapter on the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Head 101. (This is likely a chapter
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Some men frequently have warts, in their belly and on the rest of their body, which are named like mushrooms (and resemble mushrooms).
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and the lips of them are turned around.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 It is small from it, and there is something that can be greatly magnified from it.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two warts, which were similar to mushrooms in many ways: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were turned around, they were swollen, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I then cut them (the warts), and I found that one weighed about X and VIII ounces, and the other about VI ounces. The procedure for cutting them is as follows: consider if the patient is weak or sick, and the color of the wart is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cautery in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often much blood is expelled at the cutting (of the wart), so be careful if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, fearful, and timid person from the cutting with iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie it with that (the wart), using the method we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add some lead (to the stitch).
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore, do not stop tying the lead, when it is pressed into the wart, until it separates itself and falls off without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the wart is thick-rooted, then there is some fear and trembling in cutting it, especially if it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 It is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then heal it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware not to cut the testicle that is dark in color, has few senses and a foul appearance; for it is a cancerous boil; and I shall come again with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A protrusion of the umbilicus occurs for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It may be due to hernias of the scrotum, which is above the abdomen; and it goes out from there either the althub or the intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or it may be due to blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, as was mentioned earlier.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or it may be due to obstruction of wind in that place.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a hernia of the scrotum and a protrusion of the testis; then its color is similar to that of an abscess and it is soft, without pain; and its position appears different.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is, with what has been said, more pronouncedly different.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it is concealed; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound; and it becomes greatly enlarged at the entrance of the bath, and causes great pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not become concealed when pressed with the hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears dark red on the side of the back.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to flesh grown; then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and fixed to a certain extent according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to wind; then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the treatment in that case is to consider then whether the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind; then it is necessary to forbid treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For in that case there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you command the patient, so that he holds his breath and stands extended and still.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with the hot iron around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Afterwards, order him to lie down on his back upon your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then, with a broad spatula, circle around the navel in the area you have marked with the hot iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Afterwards, stretch the middle part of the wound with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around in a tight knot with thread or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be called an alexandrine.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Afterwards, open the extended middle part of the wound above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you then find the hernia already captured by the ligature: then draw out the alexandrine, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine back towards the abdomen; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if it is an artery or vein against you: then circle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert strong threads into them; and insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the wound in the shape of a cross, causing them to pierce it.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tie the wound in four places with the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and let the rotten flesh extend: and let it fall off by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is necessary from ointments, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is from a hernia in him or from moisture: then sink the wound as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And draw out blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of the place with it that it heals.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already said in the division of the species of cancer, and how to treat it with medications; and we must beware of treating it with iron, lest it be ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and we have given a warning about its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as when cancer is in the breast, hip, or similar members, to extract all of it; especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But if it has grown old and is large, do not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I could not heal from it anyone; nor have I seen anyone before me who reached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is placed as we have said, is to precede and dissolve a weak person from black choler several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then make phlebotomy of it if you find it with a clear swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the weak person with a preparation in which he is placed during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then thrust the hook-like instruments into the cancer that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out the cancer from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow, but do not cut it quickly, rather squeeze the places, and remove the clotted blood completely with your hand, or as possible there with what instruments are available.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however a flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for yourself with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 On the treatment of Hydropisis.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now describe the division of types of Hydropisis, and how water accumulates: and signs of each type, and its treatment with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is treated with iron, it is only the type of ascites alone: and it does not approach with iron the type of tympánitis: nor deeply the type of hypoascaris: for it is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 If you have been treated for this type of hydropisis tympánitis with medications, and the treatment did not succeed: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if weakness has already come upon the sick person, or there is another illness in addition to hydropisis, such as cough or loose bowels, and similar ones: then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 If you see the sick person exuding strength, and there is no illness other than hydropisis alone, and he is not a child nor an old man: then there is a way of operating on him, that you lift the sick man standing between your hands, and the attendant follows him and expresses his abdomen with his hand by pushing water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a pointed sponge (spatiumile).
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 It should have two pointed parts, long and having sharp tips like a spatiumile.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, it should contain something of shortness to prevent you from piercing through it into the intestine during the operation and damaging it.
Deinde considera.	 Then observe.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropisis is generated from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with a section of about three fingers from the navel downwards along its upper part above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 If, however, the generation of hydropisis is due to liver disease: then make your incision on the left side from the navel with three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that there should also be an incision on the side towards which the sick person will lie, so that superfluities do not flow towards the weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then perforate the whole skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then introduce yourself into that incision, and with the Spatula, slide your hand under the skin, as if you are scraping it: let the quantity that is scraped off be the size of a nail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then perforate the Spatula until it reaches the empty place: and it is the place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the spleen), and introduce an instrument into the opening, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is like a cannula: it is made of silver, copper or brass, smooth and polished; on its lower part there is a small hole, and on both sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other: and the end of it is cut, in the manner of a reed incision, as you see; at the upper end of it is a loop.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then she immediately descends onto the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water a quantity of an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, perhaps the sick person may die from the resolution of his animal spirit; or he may suffer a syncope that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to its power, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person indicate to you from the power of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the hole that is on the spleen; about which I have told you to perforate it in this way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then on the second day, if you see that the patient can bear it, remove the instrument again and extract a small amount of fluid from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Keep it for several days without fear, and beware of error until there remains only a small amount in the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and let out much water, then care for him with warm sand, steam baths, sun and expect thirst, and care for him with the strongest medicines until he is cured. Then cauterize his stomach, spleen, and liver after removing the water, as I have described in what went before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants who are born where their bladders have not been pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter fifty.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When a child is born from the womb of his mother and the head of the afterbirth is not pierced or the opening is narrow or misplaced.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to pierce it immediately at the time of birth with a very sharp spatula in this manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a fine nail made of lead into the opening and bind it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wishes to urinate, remove it (the nail) and mix it (with something).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return it (the child) (to its mother's womb).
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not put lead there, it is now possible that the urine that flows over the area will prevent the wound from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 The one whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead as we have said, for many days until it becomes wider.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is in a wrong place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because the opening is at the end of the tailbone of those who are born; therefore, it cannot urinate towards the front until it raises the tailbone with his hand to the higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 The generation is not in him, therefore, because the seed cannot reach the womb in a straight manner; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in that case is to make the sick one lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then stretch out the head of the instrument with your left hand and make an incision at the place of the priapium, with a sharp or pointed tip, similar to cutting a reed or like rooting something, so that the middle part comes out like the head of the instrument; and let it fall through the hole in the middle as required.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your operation to avoid bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore oppose it with what causes the bleeding and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Chapter on Albather (swelling) that occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, rotting, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 65.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albathers often occur in the penis, and it is a swelling of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one kind is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off, until it is thoroughly cleaned.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place a warm cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment on it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malignant and of a foul color, then administer cautery after its incision and removal.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis and a part of the Albather is inside the foreskin and a part outside, then remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, and then take care of the outside; because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal before it protrudes.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And it also happens in the testicles, and blackening and corruption of the prepuce.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that has already blackened, and what is about to be corrupted or already is corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply a linen cloth soaked with the pounded mixture of honey that has been beaten and wheat flour, as well as sieved grater-crumbs and crushed plants on top of it.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there should be bleeding, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery according to this shape:
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 A cautery is useful for two situations simultaneously, namely for bleeding and wounds when they are damaged.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the probe is corroded and destroyed completely within an hour, then it is necessary that you insert a long, lead cannula into the urinary duct and let the sick person mix with it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, if the prepuce adheres to the head of the probe and this kind of adhesion does not occur except in someone whose prepuce is healthy and circumcision is not required: sometimes it occurs due to a wound or an abscess. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the adhesion with a blunt spatula (Spatumili) until the ligament dissolves and the head of the probe is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish them exactly, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the probe and the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 This is because when the prepuce is thin, it may be pierced quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the prepuce from the head of the probe with a fine linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water to prevent them from sticking again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it shall be treated with wine of pitch, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 On the cleansing of infants, and their cure due to mistake happening to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, like other wounds; however, since it comes from our operation, with our will, and its use is particularly in boys, it is necessary that we mark the operation as better in it, and guide the way to health more easily.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Because I have found that most craftsmen and phlebotomists use cleansing by cutting with a nail and forceps; they use alfecated, ligatured, and incised with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing with forceps or ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in the cleansing with a nail, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the foreskin has two layers of skin; therefore, perhaps the upper layer is cut, and the lower layer is torn; it is forced to incise again, and pain will occur.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when the cleansing that is made with alfecated, that is, with the finger, as shoemakers use, it is not cut off at the end of the male member; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in cleansing with the nail, perhaps iron enters, and ruins your operation; and indeed the skin of a boy is short by nature, and often such things occur that do not require cleansing; and I have seen this myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The experiment with forceps and ligature using thread was good to me, because the sharpness above is like the sharpness below, since the sharpness that is above is in proportion to the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When you press your hand, the two sharpnesses correspond and cut according to one operation at once: and a compression is made in a similar shape, enclosing the skin of the branches from every side, so that no error occurs altogether.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The method of operation is that you make a guess, especially if it is from those who understand slightly, but you do not do it unless you tie the thread on the branch alone: and leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then let him rejoice and be happy in every way as possible for you, because he receives his understanding from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then let him stand between your prepared hands of the appropriate size and let him not be sitting: and conceal the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his branch and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the branch comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it yourself from that which adheres to it with dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then bind below it a little bit more ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature well, and cut between two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel off the skin quickly upward, and extract the head of the branch.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood run out gradually (it is better), and put powder on top of it: and place a cloth on top of it in which a lamb's wool that has been boiled in rose water, crushed with fresh good olive oil has been spread; and leave him on top of it until another day: and take care of him with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the forceps for excision is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 The tips of the two ends should be concave, and they should meet: let no branch of the nail protrude into them; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of the two handles evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, an error occurs during excision, because perhaps the entire inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision site.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, one should stretch it out from your hour with your nail before the excision of the place and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a tweezers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If it passes three days and what is below the inflamed area remains swollen, then let that go until the swelling subsides and the abscess becomes soft; peel off the scab with ease, and cut it according to how it is prepared for you: and beware of the tip of the probe.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For it will not harm him thus.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore take care of it with that which consolidates the wound with the powders, which we mentioned in the treatment of powders; and if it is cut beyond the measure from the skin and goes to the top, it will not harm him even thus.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of it until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Section on the extraction of a retained bladder in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Urine retention in the bladder, comes from a blockage made of stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or born flesh, and similar things from what we said in the mode of treatment division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not resolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he who is sick be laid flat on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then his feet should be placed on top of his back, and he should stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and he should tighten his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 So when the neck of the bladder is pressed toward the backside to expel the stone, urine will be released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it does not resolve as we said and the patient is very strong over the sick person: then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called syringe, which has this form (S-shape). It should be made of silver, and be thin, soft, concave like a feather pen reed in fineness, long like the palm of one hand and half: the tip should have a fine cannula.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of urine outlet through this is that you take a doubled thread, tie it at its end with wool or cotton, good ligature: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is any excess from the wool, but introduce forcefully into the cannula as one squeezes.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then grease the syringe with oil or butter and white egg: and have the sick person sit on a chair, and warm the bladder, and his penis with moist oils and olive oil and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the syringe into the penis gently until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double it from above the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder and feels weakened already approaching an empty place: this is not done according to this order, unless because the channel through which it goes has a twist in it.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then stretch out thread with wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 Wool follows flax.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then pull it out and let the linen run through the urine way: then repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and a weakened alleviation is found.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 § On the quality of clysterization of the bladder with syringe.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer in the bladder or blood congeals in it or pus collects in it and it is necessary to distill water and medicines into it: then let it be done with the instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is indeed mute, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 The concave place where the thing that pushes is should be according to the quantity required for it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, it is attracted from humidities: and when it is pushed, with it it is expelled far away: this is how the clepshydra works, which shoots naphta, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When it is desired to shoot humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepshydra into the humidity and pull with it what pushes upwards: because humidity is attracted into the concavity of the clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end into a rod, as we have said in a syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push moisture with it, for indeed the moisture immediately reaches the bladder and makes a weak person feel it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 Make a fine clyster for cleansing the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it from silver or gold; its head should resemble a syringe slightly, and below it there should be a cavity in which a cord can fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a sheep and place moisture within it for cleansing the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it between two cavities with a strong thread, and heat the moisture slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the clyster into a rod, then press your hand upon the bladder with moisture and pressure appropriate for cleansing until a weak person feels it, because the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If, however, the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it from every roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then join the circle like glue; place on it what you wish from moisturizers, oils and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it in the instrument; use it like you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on Stone Extraction.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already said about the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys or bladder and its signs; we have also discussed surgery on stone with hand and section; this is a stone that is specifically generated in the bladder, it is held in a rod and I am explaining it with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 I say therefore, that a stone formed in the bladder happens most often to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its symptoms is that the urine comes out from the bladder like water in its subtlety: and there appears in it white sand, and the sick person rubs his staff, and labors with it, and it hangs down often.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then the anus rises up and comes out together with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of children is easy until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But in young men it is in the middle, because it is between that and its cure: and the healing is easier if the stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is reversed for it.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which extracts all the feces that are in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the detection of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick person is to be received with his feet, shaken and moved towards the lower parts; so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder or jumps out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his buttocks, so that the bladder is completely lowered towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then inquire about him and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel a stone within the space, then approach immediately with cutting upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall down when touched completely, then you must push the index finger with oil from the left hand if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if the young man is full; and insert it into his anus, and inquire about the stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger and push it towards the outside at the place where you wish to make the incision; and command the servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with one hand, remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a spatula cutting (it), whose shape is as follows:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find (it) where it is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, towards the left side of the natives' (left); and make the incision over the stone (the kidney stone), and place your finger in the anus; and make the incision crosswise, so that the incision on the outside is broad, and the incision inside is narrow, according to the quantity, so that the outgoing of the Stone from this incision is not too large.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, presses the stone at the incision, and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the Stone are its angles and edges, why its outgoing is difficult on account of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is smooth, like a gland, and round; and the outgoing of it becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add (the stone) to the crack (or fracture).
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in this way, then you must fumigate (or cauterize) on top of it; or tie a ligature tightly around it, whose end is like the moon, which will squeeze the stone and not escape from it; or insert a subtle instrument beneath it with curved tips.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot do this (fumigate/cauterize) on top of it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something stops you from doing so with blood, cut it off with a scissors.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If however the stone is greater than one, then press primarily on the large stone towards the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards, press a small one behind it; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If very large, then ignorance is that it separates from above by making a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Since it happens that a patient dies from one of two things, either by dying or from frequent urine discharge; for this reason, the place does not heal completely.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or insert tools into the fracture with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have finished the operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; tie it up, and put over it a cloth soaked in olive oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; to let the abscess settle warmly.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the patient onto his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you undress him, anoint the place with water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with dymphneun ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If a hot abscess or one that corrodes occurs in the wound, and similar things happen; just as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prevented from coming out of it; and this is recognized by the expulsion of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its rotting.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water and salt; and apply everything that agrees with its healing until it heals completely.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And it is necessary during the whole treatment that you tie together both thighs and gather them, because of the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the penis sheath and it obstructs the urine flow, then cure it with what I mentioned before, before you reach incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you are exempted from incision by this treatment, now I have proved that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And take a perforating iron from an anvil, whose shape is like this: triangular at the end and sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, tie it with the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the penis with ease, until the perforating reaches the stone; and turn the perforating by your hand slowly in the same stone; and press the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Therefore urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It breaks and comes out with urine, and heals the sick one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it; then tie a thread under the stone and another above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut above the stone on the same penis between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After that, loosen the ligament and wash off the congealed blood that forms on the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone unless to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and another thread above, unless when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, covers the wound; and for this reason it is necessary that you do this when you tie the thread above, so that you lift the skin to the higher part, so that it returns at your convenience, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 On the extraction of a woman's stone.
Caput LXI.	 De Lapide in Matrice: Si aliquis femina labitur
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Videtur tamen ut quam plerumque sit hoc pervagare in venae matricis,
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 Sicut et in canibus, cum Lapis adveniat, hoc faciant. Fistulam faciant in vulva, et si invenerint Lapis, eicitur per fistulam, et fistula ferriatur, donec sanet. Si autem non invenerit, utrumque evacuab
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 Et si sic fuerit, bene est. Alius vero: quod mulier potest aliquando mori per laborem parturientis. Hoc autem non
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 Si etiam inuenieris aliquam mulierem qui fuerit partus et postea labuerit, et invenerit lapidem, curate eam: et si non potueris, utrumque evacuabis.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Et sic est curatio: Fistulam facies in vulva mulieris. Si invenerit lapidem, eicitur per fistulam, et fistula ferriatur donec sanet. Sin non invenerit, utrumque evacuabis.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 Si autem acciderit alicui mulieri lapis advenire, postea difficilis est extrahere.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 Et si aliquam inveneris, cura eam. Si quidem labuerit post partus, tunc curare debes.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 Et si ista non potueris inuenire, inuenies ut medicum castus subtilis fuerit presentis: et faciet fistulam in vulua mulieris: et postea si invenerit lapidem, eicitur per fistulam, et eicitur aliquid in illud locum, ut lapis non retrocedat, et fistula ferriatur donec sanet. Si autem non invenerit, utrumque evacuabis.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Et si non invenerit, sicut diximus, curabis illam. Si uero labuerit postea partus, tunc curare debes, quod ex quo labuit postea partus fuerat, probabiliter est lapis, quia priusquam parueret, non poterat accidere lapis in matrice: unde necesse habet curari.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If therefore he finds it [the stone], seize it with his finger and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak vulva of the woman, and search for the stone, after she has placed her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If therefore he finds the stone, then he must carefully move it from the opening of the bladder towards lower parts with all his strength until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then it is to be cut at the opposite side of the midline of the vulva near the root of the hip bone, from whichever part it may be prepared for him and he feels the stone in that place; his finger should not be removed from the stone, but seizing it firmly; and the incision shall be small initially.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then introduce the ray upon that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to its proportional size which the stone exits from that place.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For among these there is a small one, and large one, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its kind so that it may be indicated to you regarding what you desire about it.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add at that place a cauterizing agent and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone exits; and make sure that you prepare yourself with the instruments which I have mentioned for the removal of a stone in males, so that you can assist in your operation with them.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the bleeding is from an artery which has been cut; then place powder on the spot and tie it with a string tight enough for ligature; do not move it; and let the stone remain, and do not extract it yourself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of the blood has subsided after days and the place has become rotten, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 [Chapter Title] On the Section of a Watery Hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery swelling is not anything other than an accumulation of moisture in the albino scrotum, which contains the egg: and it is called a scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within its own pouch prepared for it by nature in the part of the egg, until it is thought to be ripe: which is another kind of egg and is the skin of the scrotum that we mentioned: and such a thing does not happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 The generation of this [swelling] comes from the weakness that happens to testicles, for this material flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Indeed, the color of this [swelling] is either becoming yellowish, or red like blood, or dirty, black, or watery white: and such a thing is worse.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 The signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white scrotum that we mentioned, then the abscess is round and slightly longer than an egg shape: and the testicle does not appear because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is within its own pouch, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg shape: and for this reason the man dies because it is another kind of egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under touch.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When the vision perceives the color of the moisture, then test it for the color of the moisture in an abscess with a probe square, whose shape has been mentioned before.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to what goes out in the tracks of the probe, judge about that which is within it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the weak man to be bled if possible for him, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then it lies on its back upon a low table, and many cloths are placed beneath it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit to the left of it, and order the servant to sit on its right, who will stretch out its arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the belly button.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in half along its length, until near the pubis; and make the incision according to the straight line dividing the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white albugine enclosing it; and peel it off, or beware lest you cut into it; and your peeling should be from the side that hangs more with the egg; and examine with subtlety according to the quantity as much as possible.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the albugine full of water through a large hole, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with scissors, and stretch the albugine to above; and do not touch the skin of the testicles enclosing it; and cut the albugine in any way possible for you to cut it, either entirely or piecemeal, especially the delicate side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine carefully, in the incision of it there is no security that water will not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If the egg protrudes from its skin at the hour of your operation; then when you complete the incision of the albugine, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as other wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find the egg corrupted by blackness elsewhere, then it is necessary to tie vessels, which are suspending, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its suspending ligament, and extract the egg; afterwards take care of it as I have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches; cut the other part equally as you have done on the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it is even so that the operation becomes one, then do this: afterwards remove blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert wool immersed in oil or in rose oil; and place another wool outside which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and look inside the abdomen; and put double cloths on top of them, and they are pillows; and tie them above with a ligament having six sections.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then take two cloths, let them be scented with carmin, according to this likeness; and make the ends that are pressed with something from cotton, or wet wool; and bind them together in the loins; one end shall go over the anus up to the back, and the second shall go to the part of the neck; and two ends on both hips below, and two other ends on both groins; and bind everything together in the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the section using iron; and it is so that you take a sharp knife-like cautery and cut the skin of the testicles; and it is lit, as I have said; until when the bladder filled with water appears; then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 The letters are similar to Greek.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then perforate with it that bladder, and it is lit until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch the bladder with hooks, and scrape it with a sharp cautery that is lit, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 Do not let fire touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, more remote from bleeding, and better than an operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If it happens to you at the time of incision or cautery, abscess, bleeding or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what it causes from this with the cure that suits it, according to what was mentioned before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If the patient is fearful and does not await this operation on account of its horror: then perform perforation as I tell you, and it exists.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are informed by what I said about the significations, that a branch is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then perform perforation on the abscess in the lower part of it with a broad spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until the water runs out completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a heated object on the spot and tie it up, and let it heal the remaining water: then cure it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If the obstacle is to the outflow of water at the time when you perforate it, and it is not for any other reason because a white thread obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the outflow of water: then it is necessary that you insert feather or instrument with which water from hydropic ulcers is extracted, whose shape has been mentioned earlier: or add in the operation on the wound some absorbent material.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or approximately those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it accumulates, then you should purge it in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 On the care of Fleshy Roots [or Root-like Growths]
Caput LXIII.	 De caunditate operis quod vocatur rinotomia
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 You should know that during the operation called rhinotomy, there is a risk of serious consequences in many configurations [or situations].
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 For this reason, it seems advisable to me to avoid it [the operation].
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the operation and the appearance of the excised growths [or lesions].
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say that many growths occur in the body, from which the testicles are formed; this happens due to various causes [or reasons].
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or it is due to an excess of something sharp or acidic that flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow [or impact].\]   Caput LXIV.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the growth is similar to that of the body and it does not cause pain; it is a severe growth.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Perhaps it is a stone-like growth whose color is dark and there is no sensation in it [or from it].
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 Sometimes it occurs due to a knotting of the arteries and swelling of them [or its], as I have already mentioned; or from swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 That which is caused by swelling of the arteries can be known through the position of the growth, as when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it is not necessary to touch it completely [or directly].\]   Caput LXV.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 That which is made from swelling of veins, does not disperse anything under pressure with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 It is now possible that on this kind a section may be made and on the rest of the flesh: and it is to make an incision in the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and remove it along with its white membrane: and release the suspension from the bladder, and tie the bladder: and cut the suspension after you have removed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then you must draw out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the sifaket or in that which is between the bladders: then it is necessary to release all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of it and draw out the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Branches, which is with Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIIII (62nd Chapter).
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A vine is an abscess enclosed by some enclosure resembling a bunch of grapes with the softening of testicles; and it is difficult to move and exercise or walk on a weak person.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is fear because of what happened before its memory.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 But it is necessary to say that the operation on it should be done according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that you must make the weak one sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push down on the sack supporting the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with forceps close by the rod: and let another servant hold it, and stretch it with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a broad, sharp, crosswise cut in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape away from all sides, as I told you in the removal of arteries in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a needle with a double thread into them and tie it at the first places where knots occur; and tie it again at the end of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it in a straight middle section along the body length, and draw out what has accumulated from foul, corrupted moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for the wound with treatment of other wounds where pus is being generated, so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not bad in this way.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If, however, knots occur in all the vessels, then they must be drawn out because of this for the testicles along with the vessels: lest the nourishment of the egg is deprived due to the incision, and it rots or burns and is not a help with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 § On the treatment of intestinal branches.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outcome of this branch is from an incision which happens on the extended sifach above the abdomen in the groin area from the side of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types occur due to many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a loud noise, or heavy lifting, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is from extension of a fistula.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long period of time and not suddenly; it is an abscess equal in depth to the turning (meaning, it protrudes from the skin): because a fistula presses on the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of it (meaning the fistula) when it is from incision of a fistula, because it causes intense pain suddenly at its beginning; and it is an abscess different (meaning, it appears under the skin near the surface); and that is due to the exit of intestine, and its course towards the exterior through the fistula.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine; and this is called Intestinal Ramie (Ramex intestinalis) or "Zirbia"; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and is retained there; and in this case it is a danger to the sick, because it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating this disease with iron there is fear; therefore one must be careful to avoid accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of operation is that you instruct the sick person to reduce his intestine with his own hand into the concavity of its own depth, if he obeys.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his back on his neck between your hands and raises his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then you stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards and cut the whole skin of the scrotum along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix the two lips of the incision with hooks according to what you need for opening the incision with them; and the incision should be in accordance with its size, so that it is possible for the egg to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the fistula (sifach), and everything under the skin of the scrotum until the white of the fistula becomes hard all around; then insert your little finger into what follows the testicle, into where there is the white of the fistula, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the fistula and follow it, without any adhesion that is in the back part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and as this is done, extend the white linen cloth upward with the left hand; and lift out the egg with the linen cloth to the part of the incision; and instruct the attendant to spread the egg upward; and you solve the adherence which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And ask your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the hard white linen cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find anything from it, then push it downward to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the hook, in which there is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the end of the white linen cloth, that is to say, at the tunica, which follows the incision: on the skin of the testicles; then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then bind together some of them with a figure in the form of a cross; and tie it with the silk mentioned earlier, which is beneath the ligament of the testicles: so that no pus from those things that nourish them may pass to them: lest there be a hot abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place the ligament again outside the first ligament, at a distance of more than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, let a piece of the silk, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, remain of the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely in round form, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut at the lower part of the skin of the testicles with the incision from which blood and pus run, as we have said in that which has been mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and administer the ligament as we have said.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes the white sifach is cauterized as we have said, after its incision, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This sentence translates to: It often happens that... (The rest of the sentence is missing in your quote.)
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If however the case persists, then it should be scorched with hot water: and place upon it what we have said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then take care of the wound with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on windy nose (or nasal congestion).
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this windy nose, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And first they said that it happens as we have said in the windy nose which is with the grape vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is, to tie vessels after the section on it below with ease: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with what opens it up until the vessels fall out: and take care of the wound as we have said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on rupture that happens in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and a place comes out, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, that is not enough, and it returns in all hours: but if it continues with this condition, a fissure is added in the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And it happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is, because the sifach extends: then it is softened, and the place is opened and comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 Its treatment is with cautery, as its narrative has preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and there is, that the sick one lies on his back upon your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of the rupture of abscesses and prominences, with a cut along its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the algus (a kind of bandage) and, which are under the skin, until when it appears album (white matter) that is below the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take the lancet and place it upon the prominent part from the album, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then make two incisions upon the extremity of the radius (arm) from the album, and sew one of them with the other; then extract the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the algus (bandage) at all, nor stretch it, nor anything else, as I told you in the treatment of intestinal branches (hernia).
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with the treatment for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When therefore you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound, until it is consolidated (healed).
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For the sifach (another kind of bandage) contracts and no additional prominence of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of scrotum skin (hydrocele).
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the scrotum is often softened in some men, because meat that is between it becomes soft and its appearance is spoiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the one who asks for its treatment to make the sick man lie on his back and cut all the skin that has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two flaps with stitches: and if you wish, remove three or four times the excess of softened skin with stitches, or a firm one.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds until the thread falls out.
¶ De Castratione.	 [Title: On Castration.]
Caput LXIX.	 Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 You should know that castration is forbidden under our law; therefore, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine. Its mention is only necessary for the sake of two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that it should be known by the physician when he is asked about it; and so that he may know its treatment when it occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 The other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for the sake of our benefits from it, such as sheep, hogs, cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I therefore say that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by rubbing (attrition).\]   Aut per subtractionem
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by cutting and separating (fissure and section).
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the first (attrition), the method of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become limp and hang down. Then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the castration by cutting and separating (fissure and section), it is necessary that you hold the animal and press its scrotum with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut over all the egg (ovum) with one incision, until two eggs are revealed: then cut each of them after you have peeled off the skin and do not leave anything on it except a thin piece of membrane that is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one by rubbing (attrition), because rubbing may leave something from the testicles, for which reason the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of Hermaphrodites: two methods.
Caput LXX.	 Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphroditus is from men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there appears in him what follows the space or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, the figure resembling a female vulva, in which hairs are present; and sometimes urine flows from it what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is a single kind, and it is the female's nipple on the forehead like a small man's testicle protruding to the exterior; of which one is like a man's Priapus, and two are like two male testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 The treatment of the three kinds, two from men, and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut the added flesh until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat these wounds by the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 However, in the second kind of men's, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on Incising Tentiginis and Protruding Flesh in Women's Wounds.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A Tentigo may be added to what is natural, until it becomes obscene and unsightly; and sometimes it swells so much in some women that it expands like in men, and reaches intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess of Tentigo with the hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and not to make deep cuts, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat this itself by the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 Flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the matrix, until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges to the exterior like a tail; and because of this some call the illness tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut Tentigo and heal it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Chapter on the Alratic treatment, which is the female's nipple not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The artery (or vein) of a woman should be unbroken, or the opening should be small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental is due to the preceding illness; and it itself occurs either from tissue born naturally added or subtle or thick; and it forms either in the depth of the womb or in its sides or above or below it; and it prevents coitus, impregnation, childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And the knowledge of this (condition) is obtained by the examination of an obstetrician, if the protrusion is visible nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 But if it is not visible, then search for it with your fingers or a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the protrusion is from subtle thick tissue and it is near two lips; then approach it and tear it off.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 It is (also) to place small beads on top of two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place the tips of both your hands simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with extended legs.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then spread the two lips forcefully until the subtle thick tissue is torn and the protrusion is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take thread and wet it with oil, place it on the site; and let the woman sit on it daily, so that the area does not harden from another cause.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the thick tissue is large and thick; then it should be cut with a broad, flat instrument like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the protrusion is from tissue born naturally; then hang it with tweezers and cut it; and have medicines with you that stop blood flow without causing bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and pitch mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from hardening quickly, hold it for several days; and apply flax linen, then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And when sometimes the birth in the womb occurs of flesh of other things: therefore it is necessary that they are to be cut according to this manner: while it is not a Cancerous aposteme, for a Cancerous aposteme, which is in the womb, there should be no opposition at all with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor for red ones in women's ulcers.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the vein's orifices, until much blood constantly flows out of them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become piles: and I have already said regarding their division of their kinds and the signs of them; and here I will say what receives treatment from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the sense: then there is no treatment with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are on the opening of the womb above where the sensation falls upon them, are those which can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend Athehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then powder over them on the flow of blood from one incision without crushing: such as ashes of incense, and dragon's blood, and pitch, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet against the wall at the hour of one.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate rind, and unripe lemons, and similar to them.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If therefore blood is cut with it, good; and if not, make to adhere winds (blow) on the back, and nipples, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of thistle, or the juice of argol, or the juice of wild olive leaves, that is, agalantha, Pontic wine, and make to adhere leech.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When therefore the abscess has ceased, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albath, however, is red and resembles the heads of onions, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the onion, equally; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 § On Perforation of a Dead Fetus in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the womb various species of abscesses occur, such as cancer, stone-like abscess, ulcers, adubelas, alekilas, that is, herpes, fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thistle and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these diseases and their species, and the signs of them, and their cures, in division; it is necessary that I say in this treatise about hot abscess that occurs in the womb, which is one of those abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening with iron is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore consider it.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess in its onset is sharp with striking and burning, and fever: and you see it redden; if it falls upon sensation, then do not hasten with its perforation; and care for it with what helps for maturation until when the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a bench which has two arms, and she should recline or lean upon her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her belly: and her hips should be expanded, and she should place her arms below her knees, and tie each one with a bandage suitable for that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 The midwife should then sit on the right side, and administer the tool for opening the matrix. (The matrix is another name for the womb.)
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Whose form comes to those who have passed. (This implies that the form or model of childbirth has been experienced by others before.)
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary that when you are going to administer this tool, that you feel with a deep rod the depth of the woman's matrix: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and does not harm the weak (woman).
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is too deep, then it is necessary that you place pillows on top of the depth of the woman's matrix: so that the entrance of the instrument is not all the way into the depth of the matrix: and it is necessary that you place a rebozo (a long narrow piece of cloth used as a shawl, or in this case probably referring to a twisting motion) on the upper side of the instrument: and that you hold the instrument and turn the rebozo around until the depth of the matrix opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears that there is an imminent delivery, and it is touched with the hand, and it is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that she (the mother) moves herself towards her head with a broad spatula (a large flat tool).
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the pus comes out (from the birth canal), then it is necessary that you place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some styptic (a substance used to stop bleeding) on the wound: and place the linen cloth, and make an incision in the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place outside on the matrix (the birth canal), and on the comb (a tool used to separate the birth passage) a clean wool cloth soaked in water in which wormwood has been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be treated with an appropriate ointment two days later, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 The matrix and the wound are sometimes cleansed, so that they are cleaned with water and honey; then, with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then, it should return to an ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden within the matrix internally, then it is necessary to prohibit its treatment with iron; rather, it should be treated as previously said for division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Doctrine of obstetrics, how to treat living embryos that have come out in an unnatural manner (in the form of a monster).
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the shape of a normal birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, the signs of this [normal birth] are as follows: when you see a woman pressed toward the lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and there is a fetal head felt above her [womb], and she quickly gives birth; then you will know that this delivery is in the natural form, and its exit is over the top of the head, and the posterior part with it; either suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 If you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the womb so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, it will also descend the posterior part with it; and it should be cleaned from these excess fluids using good cleanliness.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But if it is other than this delivery, it is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes a fetus comes out with its feet first, and its body comes out before its head, and one of its feet or hands; or the head and one hand come out; or the navel comes out; and perhaps it turns over to its neck, and similar unnatural forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 It is necessary therefore for the Obstetrician that he should be wise, skilled in all these matters, and let him beware of error and deception; and I am showing every figure from them, and how there is understanding in it, and it shall be signified by that, and it shall stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out upon its own head in its natural delivery, and it becomes strong upon the woman, and labor is difficult for her, and you see the power of hers already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her; and warm up her belly with fennel decoction, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula between her fingers and finds the second finger, and cuts it with it, using her own nail, until what is within her due to moisture runs out; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be cleansed with fennel mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then order her after the cleansing, that she be pressed; and make her sneeze with a snuffbox, and hold her nose and her own for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to reduce them gently little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey in the entrance, then place the woman on a chair and lift up her feet; then strike the chair on the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall due to the blow.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; then cut them and extract the remaining fetus; and tie her hand with cloth, and extract it equally; for he will come out himself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 Outcome of the embryo above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out above its feet, then it must be pushed up; afterwards, turn the fetus gradually; finally, lay him flat.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they have come out up to the hips, then order him to be pressed and let him sneeze with his mouth open; for he will be born if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then gradually withdraw the fetus until you place him in a natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he will be born then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is forbidden as we have said: then take from the mastic tree resin and sesame oil, and soluble gum; crush all well in a mortar with good pounding; then anoint with it the woman's womb and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then let her sit in warm water until she feels the afterpains.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts are now warmed, then give her a fumigation of myrrh and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When one hour has passed, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then let her sneeze; and pinch her nose and mouth; and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the child will be born immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Outcome of the fetus above knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then order him to introduce his hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back and let her feet hang down; and she herself lies on the bed and clasps her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently on the abdomen of the woman.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then remove what is beneath his feet from the puluinaribus until it is prepared below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then grasp his feet and move them forcefully.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the hypocondria gradually until the fetus ascends to higher places.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands and feel the fetus gradually; and order the woman to press herself until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The fetus exits with a broad hanging from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 It must be reduced by means of the hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced (by the hand), then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then lay her on a bed and strike her legs forcefully.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive for the reduction of the hand and feel the fetus according to its natural shape; and make the woman sneeze and order her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The fetus exits above its neck with spread hands, and its face is turned towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it gradually and feel it easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is felt, then place it on the oil and mucilages that I have mentioned.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then order her to move it gently.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done this, then make her sit on a seat and order her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then order her to press herself; and make her sneeze with force.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The outcome (of the surgery) is a preterm baby on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When the fetus descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the presenting part (i.e., second twin or breech), then you should cut the presenting part with your nail until it is evacuated due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus hangs with its face and neck, then you should make an incision from the navel to prevent it from being retained and dying.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus to the interior (to deliver it) until you place it in the correct position. And tell the woman to compress herself several times: for it will come out with an easy delivery.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Delivery of twins or multiple babies.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are born often, and sometimes three, and even four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is unusual and rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five is indeed beyond nature, and they do not live fully: it contains them, even though the second one binds them together with the cord connected to each of their navels. And they can be separated by cutting through the sifach, which distinguishes between them and connects them with a bond at their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 Sometimes they come out as a single fetus does in a natural delivery, easily. And sometimes they come out with an unnatural exit, as we have mentioned.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult in childbirth and reach the conditions we have described as unnatural, then care for them as we have mentioned: let a skilled midwife be present, who performs with ease and slowness and takes every measure to help according to all possible shapes so that what is prepared may lead to their salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remembering that which forms in the womb from embryos and miscarries.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten are formed in the womb and miscarry: I have already witnessed a woman who miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done was measurement by the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 This whole matter should be in the science of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach a similar one, therefore oppose it with what is needed.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Chapter on the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus with what I said in the division from the medicine, and it does not come out, and you must perform an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of sound virtue and not with any accident from which her loss is feared: then she should be laid on her back on the bed, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and a servant should hold her from two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then the mouth of the womb should be moistened with oils, albumen of egg and linseed meal.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician should anoint his hand with these oils and mucilages; then he should introduce it into the womb gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he should ask her where a place is to be found for the hooks in the fetus, and places corresponding to it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its head; then fasten hooks in its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or near the ribs, and under the breastplates.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If the descent is onto its feet, then on the chest and middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that the hook be held with the right hand; and make a wound at the place between the fingers of the left hand; and introduce it gently with the hand, and fasten the hook in one of those places which we said, until it reaches an empty spot.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another hook or third one, if needed: so that the constriction is equal and it does not slip to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then extend the extension equally and not let it be just along a straight line but move it towards every direction in order to relieve its opening: as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it must be softened that which is between [the hooks].
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part remains stuck, then the midwife should bind certain fingers with oil and insert them from that side in order to turn it with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the fetus comes out then the hooks should be moved to another higher place: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand comes out before the others and cannot be retracted due to its swelling: then a cloth should be wound around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then remove [the hand] until when the whole one comes out, cut it at the junction of the foot or elbow: and thus you must do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the fetal head is large, or if there is swelling in its delivery or water has gathered in its head: then a pointed spatula (Spatumile) should be inserted between the fingers and the head should be crushed and water extracted; or it should be broken with the instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly do so if the fetus is of large-headed nature: then it should be separated with an algengatum; or extract it with a misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and swells at the neck: then it is squeezed, until the moisture within the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not become complicated and does not obey towards the exit: then cut off the head piecemeal, as far as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If it is below the abdomen [location of the wound] and is an abscess or contains hydrops: then it should be perforated, until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 But if the fetus is above its feet, then its pulling is easy, and its direction towards the bone of the matrix is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 But if it gets twisted in the abdomen or chest: then you should extract it along with the cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and open the abdomen or chest, until what is inside runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 But if other limbs are removed and the head returns: then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the mouth of the matrix is open, then insert your hand deep into the matrix and search for the head with it and pull it towards you with your fingers up to the mouth of the matrix; then insert a hook or hooks and pull it along with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the mouth of the matrix is twisted due to a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then it should not be pressed on it, but rather warm liquids and ointments should be administered; and apply plasters; and sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, it can be turned over; then administer what I have said for a live fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that cannot be done, then cut it piecemeal and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must not leave anything of the placenta inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you complete your surgery, then administer what I have said for hot abscesses that occur in the matrix.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, then it should be let down into cold water, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have seen a woman, in whose womb a child had died; then she became pregnant again on top of that one, and another child also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 After a long time, a boil occurred on his navel, which became swollen until it was opened; and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for his treatment, and he was treated for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, I applied to him some strong adhesive plasters; and bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then a few days passed, and another piece of bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore amazed when there was no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, you thought because the children who had died were of bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked for the wound and extracted many bones from a woman who was in good condition; and she lived like this for a long time, and hardly discharged pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 I did not fix this foreign object here unless there was knowledge about it and assistance from the physician-artist in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the shapes of necessary instruments for extracting a child.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of the Stricture Device, by which books are equalized, having equally two spindles at both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this Spindle should be more delicate than the Stricture Device: and it should be made either of Ebony or of Boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all the pieces should be like two fingers: and the edge of each one is like a single finger, and the length of each is a palm (hand) and half, or slightly less: and in the middle of two pieces there are two additional parts made of the same kind of wood, which have already been fixed to both ends, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of either one is like two fingers or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additional parts are inserted into the cavity of the matrix (womb), so that it opens when you rotate the two spindles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spindle which opens the uterus.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form resembling this one, but more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made of Ebony or Boxwood, similar to the form of forceps (tweezers).
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at its end there should be two additional parts as you see here above: and the length of each of the additional parts is like a palm: and the width of either one is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the uterus with it, then make the woman sit on the bed with her feet hanging down, with what is between her thighs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected additional parts into the uterus: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument in the same way as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the uterus, until the midwife does whatever she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Dizziness other than what the ancients called Form of Forced Delivery, by which is delivered the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 Forma of Misdelivery, by which a large head is crushed: and it resembles a pair of forceps, having teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it occurs in the shape of a long forceps as you see, having teeth like those of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 Forma of Misdelivery, by which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 Form of a Shears having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 Form of a Shears having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 Form of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 Form of Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 Form of two wider Spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are used in all cases, and the more their number and types multiply, the quicker they are for use by an artist, and the higher among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore do not neglect that an instrument is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For it is indeed essential for their use.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the Second Extraction (Cesarean section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII:
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the weak woman to retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with powder and press your hand over her mouth and her nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it comes out through this way, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in the cover; place within it herbs opening the womb, such as camomile, rue, anise, fennel, hartshorn, wood-sorrel, centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a plug of reeds over the hole of the pot's cover and another end into the womb; hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze again, as I have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 The afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or althea mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then she will insert her finger and seek for the afterbirth.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she finds it, then take it and gradually pull it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply in the womb, then insert the hand as I have said, until when she finds the afterbirth and pulls it out gradually along with its right and left side; this must be done without falling from the strong pull: indeed, it should be rotated easily to the right and left sides; afterwards, add more to the force of the pull.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It will then obey and be preserved, and come out from the attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is dislocated, as we have already narrated: treat it with stimulation (or shaking) and with a remedy from an earthenware pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire yourself by repeatedly attempting extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 However, whatever comes out from the matrix bone towards the woman's hip, tie it up (or bind it).
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then cleanse her with a four-drug ointment (a mixture of olive oil, castoreum, rose oil and galbanum).
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For in a few days it will rot her, dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it begins to rot, let it be raised from her towards the stomach and head, and it will harm the already weakened part.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for this purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already tried fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument used for fumigation during retention (or delayed delivery) of a second child or menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it similar to an alca, or from a jar; place the broad end over the fire; position the fumigation on plums; hold it there until the fumigation is consumed; then repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, which have been cauterized by a sharp scalpel (a surgical tool used for circumcision).
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 The obstetrician must therefore pierce it with his finger; and if not, he should pierce it with a sharp spatula; and let him be careful not to touch the muscle.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place warm linen soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If one fears it may close up again, then place a leaden tube in the opening and remove it when the child wants to be born.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now it happens that anus closes, even from consolidation of the wound or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, one must remove that consolidation, and then treat it as we have said with lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodation and swelling that occur near the external anus; or in the space of one part; and it is a single fistula or multiple fistulas.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When that nodation has matured, it opens and watery white fluid or thin pus flows out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes these fistulas penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out through defecation and wind when the sick person uses the toilet; and possibly a worm may come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas when they penetrate into the space as far as the bladder and as far as the root of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are fistulas that penetrate to the junction of the hips and to the sacral node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this it is recognized that the penetrating fistula reaches the anus; and even if it does not penetrate, it is to introduce your index finger into the anus; and insert a probe made of copper or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a curvature in it, then insert into it a fine probe made of lead, or a hair from horse's mane, until you feel the probe, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it fully nor does anything come out of the incision nor pus nor worms as I said, then you will know that it is non-penetrating; therefore approach for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder or the urinary meatus, its signification is the discharge of urine from it; and the prevention of this is by the consolidation of the place with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it penetrates to the juncture of the hip or the hip bone, its sign is that the probe reaches there if there is no curvature up to the bone; and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus always discharges from it; and that medication does not work in it nor does the place consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and the cure for them is labor and futility to one who is foolish about it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in the one that is non-penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a knife; according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it; and it is, as lying weak on your hands upon its back, and its legs lifted up above the hips of itself, and the hips are inclined towards the belly of itself.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert a probe made of lead or copper if there is curvature in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if a sick person feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you feel that a thing has already begun to penetrate your finger by itself, which you perceive to be between your finger and the flesh, then certainly you will know it is penetrating; do not then labor on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that the flesh heals in some people and that the remedy expected for it is to heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been mentioned before, and then to introduce the heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat this twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh near the fistula, which is similar to a bird's feather pen, has been burnt away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then cover the burned flesh with linen strips soaked in butter until the burnt flesh comes out; then cover it with ointments that promote healing and consolidate the flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it comes out and does not reach your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sifac between it and the fistula; and you see that the fistula follows the skin surface which follows after; then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and while cutting with the fistula, you go cutting as far as the tip of the fistula until the cutting reaches where the tip of the fistula ends, and the fistula is released and falls off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean the burnt flesh that is similar to a bird's feather pen, so that nothing remains from it.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood overwhelms you and it dissolves between you and your operation, so that the flesh separates; then it is better to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Since the cautery with fire brings good habits to it, burning of those added tissues, and the removal of blood and draining of moistness are added to it.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then, for treatment, the linens are rolled up in butter or boiled cabbages until the place releases pus, and the burnt tissues emerge in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then, for wound treatment with hardening ointments that cause firm flesh; there are medications consisting of styptic and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is healed, then it is cured; do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached deep into the anus and it is extended from the body; then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel a thickening between you and her, and there is a membrane from the sheep's bladder or flesh, and it is close to penetration; then there is no operation on this unless through faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 This is because a single method is administered in it: either to cauterize her as we said; or to excise it until you reach its hollow, so that it is possible for you to insert linens and cure it from the inside.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the excision, so as not to cut the muscles holding the anus, and there may be an unfortunate outcome of defecation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then, for treatment, do as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal; or you remove the membrane itself, and clean it after cutting it up to near the anus, as we said, either with a thickening or with another sharp tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then, clean those tissues filtered during the excision as much as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with a section, and at the superior part where it solidifies; and a fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is drained in this manner; and it occurs when you insert a probe into the fistula, which is on the side of the anus near the body surface with skin and anus margin; then take a probe with a perforated end, which resembles an awl (aleskef), prepared from calfskin, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread wound from five strands, and around that.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollowed part.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If the thread penetrates the internal anus margin, then pull out the thread from that hole; so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and gather both ends together; tie each one separately and let it be for one or two days; and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the tissues between the two ends of the thread fall off and drop; then care for the wound until it solidifies and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 But if the fistula opening is not penetrating; then make it penetrate however you prepare it, except if it goes too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you do not have the skill to do that without cutting it (the fistula).
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as I said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of the spatulate needle used for draining a fistula whose sharpness is very acute on one side and the other side is not acute, so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 § On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows upon their incision; and care for fissures (cracks in anus).
Caput LXXXI.	 Head, LXXXI (81st entry)
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Piles are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Either they are inside the anus, like bladder stones or cherries; or they are themselves like the seeds of a pomegranate.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 Some are small and others large; blood comes out from them always, some are single, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 They are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are mostly dry, from which citrus juice or a little blood runs continuously; and they are in color like the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to advise the sick man to take a laxative; and they are squeezed out, until the anus appears, and they appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, hang them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them off at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they cannot be held in place with hooks due to their moisture and softness, then take them with rough cloth or a glove made of double wool, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and sprinkle warm powders on the cuts to help stop the bleeding.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not respond to emptying, then give the sick man a mild enema with which to cleanse what is in the anus, so that it will quickly obey emptying when he is squeezed.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the piles are outside the anus, then their condition is light and easy; it is to take them with your nail or with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as I said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if it is necessary to avoid incision with iron, then suture them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread wrapped around, and introduce it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then bring out the hernia upwards, and make it penetrate with the point into the root on the other side: wrap two ends of the thread around the point of the needle, and let them be wide: and tie the hernia tightly with a strong stitch.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread, and draw out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all hernias, and let one of them go free; do not sew it up, so as to avoid an excess of bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch over the anus, and put it on the anus: and tell the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he faints.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When hernias fall down, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Chapter on treating fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often occur due to the drying out of feces and constriction by nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they become old and medicine is of no use for them: then it is necessary to shave them with a spatula or with your nail, until they become moist and the upper skin which prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then shave them more vigorously than the first time, until they bleed a lot, and after that care for them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 Chapter on the treatment of hemorrhoids, both internal and external, and hernias and worms.
Caput LXXXII.	 Head, LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is not other than a round knot similar to the head of a nail: and it forms throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and it happens that pain occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it must be cut off which is around the nail head, and it should be held with forceps or with a hook, and it should be pulled out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that [area] and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was mentioned in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 An excrescence, however, one is a small eminence that is rough, filtered, rounded above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And it frequently occurs in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 Its treatment is to stretch the excrescence and cut it; or tie it with silk thread; or with hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine as mentioned before; and now the excrescences that grow inward and not outward can be removed with an instrument I will mention later.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Formica is also a small, rough excrescence that is thick and projecting above the surface of the body, penetrating deeply: and when cold is found in it, it feels like a bite by an ant, and it occurs throughout the body; and it most frequently occurs in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 Its treatment is to take a reed from the goose's feather or strong vulture's feather; and place the reed on the Formica until it forms a circle around its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then rotate your hand with the reed until it cuts what is around the Formica; and place it deep into the flesh, and remove the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do it with an air or iron cannula in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 The upper part of the cannula should be pulled up to its limit, wrapping around the deaf ear so that it may be held onto and turned (the cannula).
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize a scabies, do it as described for the cauterizing of Athil's ear in the chapter on cauteries.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for the solution of the stomach, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made of silver, or of gold, or of molten copper, or of beaten copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore that which is administered for the cure of small children should be small; and for those with weak or painful anuses, so also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The upper part of the cannula, that is, where it is tied to the uterus, should be wide according to this method; and there should be a distinction so that it may be tied to the uterus as you see, and the lower end which enters into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, very fine, pulling to fineness; and in one side of its there should be two holes, and in the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and not too thick, and the uterus in which medicines are placed should be from an animal's bladder; or from a sheep's skin, which should be small like an ass's foot; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as it is turned, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then introduce into those holes a thread, preferably from a raw cord, which should be one of ten cords or about the same, and tie it up with it like an asafetida bag.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When this is placed within the uterus, a clyster (enema) is to be tied off at the top with strong constriction between two distinct points.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then perform a clysterization with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the circle shape (diagram) depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of performing a clyster with it is: to fill the uterus or bladder with a medicine that has been heated according to the capacity of the patient's tolerance, and be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient lies on his back, and lifts his legs towards the top; and place beneath him a blanket, that is, leather or cloth upon which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with white goose fat, or with slippery elm gum, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it (the clyster) into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the servant take hold of the uterus with both hands and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the clyster passes into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clyster and the patient lifts his legs towards the side of the bed.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him to evacuate, then hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is more effective in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you perform a clyster on him for diseases of the bowels and his evacuation is hastened, then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or raw ulcers in the anus, then make the clyster very fine and gentle, like those used to clysterize children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this should be the form of a subtle suppository that is applied on tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 On the treatment of head wounds without broken bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXXIIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for a book, and here I will say their treatment with hand, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to the kind of injury they are and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, as for the kinds of wounds, they are like the blow of a stone: either a cut by a sword or knife: or a strike with a lance, wood, or arrow: and similar to these things from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that are made according to the parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back; and similar to these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatments of some wounds, so that I may place this reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the reminder of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple head wound occurs and there is no bone fracture, consider then if it was from a blow of a stone or similar, and only the skin has been broken, and the wound is large, and you fear impending abscess from hot suppuration: then hurry, and immediately apply a phlebotomy of the head: do not delay this: and extract as much of it as its virtue allows, if nothing prevents phlebotomy, especially if the blood that flows from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the sick person avoid filling himself with food and drink, and heavy meals.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 But if something prevents reduction, then let him reduce from food, and avoid meat and wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 Place hot poultice made of cooked linseed soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine containing resin (mastic), upon the ulna if it happens to have a hot abscess.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from the hot abscess, then place upon the ulna if it is fresh with its own blood and has not changed air, later I will tell you about the powder; and if already the air has changed for it, then place some unguents on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the ulna is large or from a sword cut and similar ones: and if its edges are not gathered together by blisters, then gather it with suture, as I will tell you about suturing of wounds in the abdomen.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the ulna has already been exposed from bone and hangs without retention except for a small suspension, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the ulna with medicines and restore firm flesh to its place instead of skin, and instruct the sick man to eat foods with thickness such as heads (of animals) and cooked wheat until it is soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find putrefaction on the skin that is not adhering to the bone, then cut out the entire putrefied part and throw it away; then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it does not separate with the medications, then seek above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity requires it and the remedies we have mentioned do not work, then cauterize (it) until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, their outcome is easy and light; therefore, apply this powder to them, as it solidifies them before the air changes.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method for the cauterization of a tumor.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Recipe one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime: grind it all very well, and sieve it: fill the wound with it and apply a good pressure until it adheres well to the top, and let it coagulate with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then tie it on top with small cords, and leave it untouched until it does not separate.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine will not be uprooted from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does this when there is no olibanum and dragon's blood available to you in the present. The same operation also works with many large wounds when it should be placed on them and tied, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has altered it in some way, especially when it is in summertime, then there is no purpose to this powder: cure it with what we have said, so that you place some digestive ointments on it or place over it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until it emits pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then cure the rest in the usual manner until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If a fracture occurs with the wound in bone and it is small, then extract it with trephine (Gesti): and I will now speak about the treatment of skull fractures in the future.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On neck wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple skull wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery in the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no artificice except to suspend its treatment until it recovers strength, like in case of zygias and zeges, and similar ones.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm nerves, and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold directly on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is above the limbs; let it be remedied with soft medicines such as lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, or with pitch, when it is washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones, and unguents in this manner, and ointments that are moist.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture; or the edges of it with threads and fibers.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound has depth or if a cavity occurs in its lower part, where already pus gathers, then pierce it more deeply at a lower location in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has already been cut in the wound and its blood flow is flowing out: then separate or sever it, and tie it; or cauterize it if there is a need for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the trachea has already been pierced, either completely or partially, and the lungs have been saved: then gather the skin flaps with suture over the neck of the trachea, and do not touch the trachea, but sew it up, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then sew it up tightly with a suitable stitch, and let it heal for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointments containing styptic and astringent properties, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it; if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them or as many as you can; and what cannot be prepared, leave it alone until the wound rots, separates, and purges its discharge.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If a wound is recent, then sprinkle powder upon it, as I have told.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it appears that bone is visible in the wound, and a fistula forms: then treat it with the method described in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on Wounds Treated with Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and its depth can be seen, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If a windy discharge comes from the wound when someone who is sick is breathing heavily, then you know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the depth is not apparent, and it is a recent wound with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor press it so that the blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person: instead, put on it an attracting ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If the ointment is not available to you, then put in the opening of the wound an old piece of cotton, so that it absorbs what comes out from it due to moistness: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that it heals as it accumulates in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If already three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and no spasm occurs in the sick person, nor a bad heart tremor, nor a narrowing of breathing, and you see good indications of recovery: then know that the wound is well.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Treat it with linen cloths, and the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If healing does not occur, and it always opens up, then know that a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat it from its respective chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 If the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with that which came before in stitching, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If however he has already made an impression on the bone and cut off fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If however they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound rots, for the extraction of them will be easier when it has rotted.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 As for other wounds on other members, the judgement in their cure is the same as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on Wounds of the Abdomen, and the Exit of the Intestines, and Their Removal.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 Rupture which happens in the abdomen is great, middle, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore from a great rupture sometimes the intestine or number of intestines comes out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Thus it requires insertion [of them], and their suture is more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small rupture also occurs in another way [difficultly].
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore it will be more difficult to reduce [them] if you do not hurry in inserting them to their place immediately: because it swells, opens, and becomes enlarged; therefore the entrance is made difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 For this reason it is better to make a middle rupture because the reduction of the intestine is not difficult with it, as it is in these two cases [great and small ruptures].
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures come together in the suture of the abdomen and in the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more proper to the suture of the abdomen; and I tell you one by one with their explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore I say that if the wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is according to one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; Or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to the cold of air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When therefore that is so, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you immerse a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water squill, cyperus, cumin, and wormwood with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it does that wine in which there is stipulation; and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When therefore you see that the inflation is already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which artemisia has been boiled, or with wormwood.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For by this it is healed the entrance of it with a small opening.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If however there is an extrusion of it after this treatment, then sew up the rupture with a little, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than cutting; and it is not forced to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and another part not sharp; and the end should not be subtle with the subtlety of a needle, but rather slightly blunt; and that resembles a sheath, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that the return of it should be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible above it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the abdomen; then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen; then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of two parts of the stomach, then place your intention and always consider this: that the part containing the wound should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And it must be done for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 For small wounds, do that which is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make it so that a faithful servant, who will hold the rupture with his whole hand, is present among your hands. And gather his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then take something for the one who follows to sew with, a little after a little. And this is the common method of suturing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 It is that you should take a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then release from the end of the rupture the width of a finger ring, that is, of the doctor. And sew the needle one over what you insert the thread into it at both ends of the skin, as well as both ends of the sifac which is beneath the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side. And you have already gathered the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the sifac. And there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times from both parts at once, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together with proper closure.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of a finger and sew another needle into it. Afterwards draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore do not cease to do that with the one you need from the needles until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness because fine needles deeply cut the flesh, and coarse ones are difficult to enter the skin. Therefore it is necessary for them to be of medium thickness in both fineness and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 It is not proper that the needle be fashioned in two extremities of the skin closely joined: so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and even when sutured, they should not be stretched out, so that the wound is prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the needle, so that it does not harm the weak person during sleep; and place threads from cloth all around, which hold the ends of the needle; and leave them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of sewing with needles in this manner is more appropriate for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one or two needles, or about that number, are sufficient for their sewing (i.e., the stitches).
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second common sewing is when you gather with the stitching the edges of four: the edges of two skins and the edges of two sifac in place of one, with the needle containing the thread wound evenly in fineness and coarseness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you penetrate with the needle these four edges, pull back the needle from the side where you started, so that the thread fixed above the wound falls out: so that the stitching is like the sewing of cloth where the cloth is sewn together, and place between every stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This kind of stitching is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitching I sewed my own wound that happened to me in the belly of a man who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm; and about two palms had come out from the intestines from the middle intestine, and the tear was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore brought it back after his intestines had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound has been consolidated about fifteen days hence: and I healed it, and it became healthy: and he lived for many years afterwards, having returned to his accustomed ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not heal it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore I placed hot mustard on the wound twice a day, and attended to its cleaning with water and honey until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I shall now describe two types of stitches according to the story's account.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it begins with a sharp stitch: and you insert the needle from outside to inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle penetrates the skin and follows the length and breadth of the entire body: release the tip at the side where you inserted the needle, and let it pierce another end from the inside to outside at the opposite extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 And when you have made it penetrate, then let it pierce again in the same side from outside to inside: and release the tip where you released it before, and let the needle pierce another end from the inside to outside at the opposite extreme: and let it pierce together with your previous penetration, until it reaches the entire thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin again from this same side, and take out the stitch with its opposite end, which is on the other side of the skin that it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then bring it back into the skin and take out its opposite end with this end: and take out from the skin the end that was on the other side of it, and do so alternately until you have extracted the entire stitch according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The final stitch of this suture is to sew together the skin layers in such a way that one side of one end of the skin is sewn with one stitch; and to leave the other side with the other end, until it is complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of suture mentioned by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This discourse was narrated to be similar to the way some physicians perform it, as they gather all parts that are naturally connected and bring together their corresponding ends; and apply one end to the other's corresponding end, and the edge (mirach) of one to the other's edge.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You should make an incision at the edge (mirach) near you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the interior only; and leave the two ends of the skin.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the incision, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the interior through both ends of the skin, on either side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both and make both penetrate from the inner part to the outer through two edges on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than the common easy one, and it is the suture of which the previous mention has been made.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 Therefore, this is also a discourse by Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The abdominal suture is repaired with two incisions (acubus).
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 To insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the incision of the needle, from what is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side, following the suture of those who are equal in thickness (coria).
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then the suture of this place is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of medication for a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 When you have a new wound with its blood, before it changes due to air: and you reduce the intestine, and clean it, and prepare it: then place it on a powder of meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already changed the wound: then place on it certain ointments that you have present, so that it produces pus: and let them fall off, and be bound up with lint and myrrh.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as the care for other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medications present for you, then immediately place on it a hot, old cloth that begins to emit pus: and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need other medications when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal members in injury, then it is necessary that you immerse a soft wool in oil of moderate heat or rose oil: and place it in the surrounding areas which are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain or punctures or putrefaction in the intestines (for this often occurs): then cleansing of the bowels with wine of soap, black and warm: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine and become a discharge penetrating to its hollow.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what is from the small ones, harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its large number, which is from veins, and the size of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If however what proceeds from the wound is a bone splinter, and you grasp it freshly, reduce it according to your reduction method of equalizing intestines.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If it has passed beyond (the wound), and has become green or black, then you must tie it with a thread above the site where it has become darkened, to prevent bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For there are veins and arteries in bonesplinters.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut the ligament beyond it, and place two ends of the thread hanging from below the wound on its outer side: to facilitate the pulling away from you of its attraction, and extraction of the bonesplinter at the site of the splintered bone, and draining of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Memory of a wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small, it can be restored in some people: therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his abdomen by a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and pus and gas escaped from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore administered treatment until I was not confident in his healing; neither did I cease to refine it until he was healed and the site consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the site already consolidated, I feared for the sick man that an accidental evil might occur in his abdomen; and no accidental evil occurred to him from it.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better conditions for himself, eating and drinking, and defecating, and entering the bath, and exercising in his own diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experiencers said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it must be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is, to receive ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When its head is on them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head; for it clings and cannot be detached.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease until the ant, after the second, is equal to the entire size of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it and let the wound heal.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For these heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is fed, and it heals, so that no harm comes to the sick person completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible that the intestine may be tied even with a fine thread: what has been removed from the animal's intestine remains attached to it after it is introduced into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is, to receive the end of this thread from the intestine and let much flesh be cut away.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then introduce the thread into the point and let the intestine come out with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to separation.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of sewing with ants and the intestine is not excepted except by way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large wound, wide, especially if it is on one of the thin intestines: then there is no artifice except subtlety, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on Wounds and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old and decayed, and turns into an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and cannot be cut off: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be a Fistula, and we call it a Zuchimen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 A fistula, in truth, is a hard, white knot; one without pain, having the hollow shape of a bird's feather; and on account of this some call it Risatus, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 In some hours it [the fistula] becomes wet, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 Perhaps moisture is divided at some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And at times this moisture is much and at times little; and it is thick and at times thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 I have already stated in the division [that] every ulcer that does not heal nor is born from it flesh, is not this but due to one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these [causes] is when the amount of blood in the body is too little or it is malicious; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips preventing the growth of flesh; or because there are many sores and putrefaction; or because the ulcer itself is rotten, and the matter that is emitted from it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for healing it; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and recovery from boils by nature is slow; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones [present].
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have shown all these causes and their signs, as well as the treatments of them with medicines in the division; now here it is necessary that I tell you the cure for a fistula and a boil, which is performed by the way of an operation using hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, know that a fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For there are fistulas that reach to large veins and arteries, nerves or tendons; or intestines, bladder, or one of the ribs; or spinal bones, or some of the joints composed in composition, such as hands and feet; and there are those that approach the proximity of a principal member or similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 This fistula, according to this method, is one of difficult healing, and it does not admit treatment, and attending to it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If any fistula has a depth that does not reach the places I mentioned and you hope for its cure, trust in it, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the fistula follows a straight course, and examine it along with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twist in the fistula, then investigate it with a slender lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since lead, because of its softness and curvature, adheres to twists.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Seal therefore the opening from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 Because moisture, which you seal it with, flows towards other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then examine and investigate carefully according to the method that is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the fistula has a deep depression or a shallow one; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stands over the whole thing, with all your strength, through questioning the sick person, by inquiring about pain when pressure is applied to the place, and similar signs and causes of bleeding.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have therefore firmly stood over all these matters, then go to treatment according to confidence; and it is necessary for you to consider at this time whether the fistula is near, appearing in a safe place far from a joint, a nerve, an artery, or vein, or in one of the places I mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as stated before in my narration, remove what is in it from filtering and decayed flesh that arises in its opening from flesh or ulcer, and similar things, and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If a Fistula is of great depth and straight, then it is necessary to cut it deeply as much as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then clean it thoroughly from all the corrupted flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer a linen cloth wrapped in sharp medicines and insert it into the concavity of the fistula as far as you have grasped with iron, do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula due to decay.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have said before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain about this, then investigate it and cut it out as I have told you; if it does not forbid you anything from the vein or nerve or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is discovered and there is some decay and blackness within it, then scrape it until all the decay is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with that which causes it to heal, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did; then you will know that you have not reached the complete removal of the decay.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Investigate it again above and find out its reason and thoroughly clean it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; if not, then you will know that the decay is in a deep and distant part of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You are therefore not skilled enough for it except to let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the bone is small and decayed and if it is possible for you, pull it out with fine forceps suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then carefully make an attempt to draw them all out, without leaving anything within them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If something from the moistures opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in the incision: then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If there is no preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place something above the wound that decomposes it; and leave it until it decomposes, what is within the circumference of those bones from the flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 Tie the incision that you made during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on it, if you are afraid, a piece of cotton soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures have decomposed, and the bones separate from them, clean away their removal, and their drawing out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large bone, such as the thigh bone, hip bone, and similar ones, and what has been corrupted from it is a large part: then grind it with a fine rasp, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is in it has become a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it completely until the place where the corruption has reached; then take care of it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you of a case that happened to a man in his leg; so that you place it as an example and assistance for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about 30 years old, who had pain in his leg, caused by something that moved upon him inside the body, that is, from within; until matter reached the calf, and there was an abscess made: and it was not an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 The incision was made at the same time as the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many substances converged with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 The treatment was delayed until the leg had become fistulous, and many openings were made therein: all of which discharged pus, and bodily moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for approximately two years, and there was no skilled surgeon's hand present until I was summoned, and I saw his leg, and the substances that were flowing from those openings with a great course: even the whole body of the man was already stiffened, and his color had become yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were flowing into each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I approached and cut through one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it decayed: which was already rotten, blackened, putrefied, and pierced through until it had reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Then I sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And assigned that there was no bone other than that decay which I cut off and sawed away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And now I had removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed a dressing on the wound with strengthening medications for a considerable distance.
Et non est consolidatum.	 It is not healed.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I probed and exposed the bone a second time above the first exposure, and found continuous decay with the bone: and I sawed away that which appeared to me from this decay as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 And then I attempted a dressing for it.
Et non est restauratum.	 It is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I therefore examined it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and attempted its restoration; it was not restored, until I cut a bone about the size of a palm and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I healed it with medicines and it was quickly consolidated and cured; this repetition in the operation and section of it was not necessary, except due to the disposition of the patient's weakness, his small tolerance, and my fear for him concerning death; since he suffered in all hours from mal-syncopes due to excessive evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore it was cured completely with healing; and new flesh hard was born at the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he turned back to his dispositions; and he did not suffer any harm at all from walking contrary to it.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If the protruding bone at a place of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you tie it in this way: and it is as follows: take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone; and command someone to stretch it upward; and place another thicker ligament on the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie it over the flesh that is next to the bone; and extend its end so that you draw the flesh downward; and you loosen the flesh above the place which you want to cut, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or board underneath the bone below properly; because when you do this, it is not forbidden to cut the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that there be a saw above the corrupted place somewhat, so that the corruption is not in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance, and force another to saw on its behalf.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and is not projecting, but rather it is continuous with a part of it: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in one of its parts: then excise all the flesh from every part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Place the splint beneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Cut the affected part with a saw from that side where there is corruption, until the other saw-cut meets it. And make the saw-cuts according to our earlier instructions in length slightly beyond the corruption.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut through the affected joint and saw the bone where it joins from another side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is at a place of two joints' connection, then it is not a fracture, but rather an abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is at the tip of the hand or foot: then there is a very difficult matter in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 It is necessary to investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And abrade it, and clean it as much as possible for you, and rectify it with whatever skill is available to you: when it does not contradict the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that these saws and cutting knives for cutting the bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their coarseness or fineness, their size, and their thickness, and their hardness or softness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare every type of surgical instrument suitable for that particular operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations require from you a type of instrument that suits the case when you have long-term interest.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And knowledge of the methods of this art is a sign of the nature of the diseases: then you will find for yourself what suits it among the instruments for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I confirm to you at the end of this chapter's number of instruments, which you shall place examples upon that you cut into, and a proof by which you test on other things.
Forma Serrae.	 Straight Sickle.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Other Straight Sickle.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Other Straight Sickle.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Other Straight Sickle.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This shape of the sickle should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make its upper part a bow, sharpen it with iron; and its handle from boxwood, and make it pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Shape of the Scissors.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this scissors should be shaped like the head of a star-shaped nail; and its points should be shaped like the points of a pincers.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not appropriate unless they rub against the heads of the scissors when they are broken, or a large and wide bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Larger Scissors' Shape.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Medium-sized Scissors' Shape.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Wide Scissors' Shape.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Scissors' shape with a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Other Fine-tipped Scissors' Shape.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Other Curved-tipped Scissors' Shape.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Small Fine-tipped Scissors' Shape.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Scissors' shape for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, Large Scissors' Shape.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a Saw, and its tip is like a Sickle; it is used in many places according to the reason for bone removal.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Scissors' shape suitable for removing that which has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its tip is triangular and sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It is made of Ivory.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, everything that I have said should be made from Scissors, and Cutters, and Sickles.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 On making incisions in limbs, and the suturing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Limbs rot due to either external or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 If the corruption has been treated with medicines and the treatment does not help, and you see that corruption has spread to a limb without affecting anything else, then it is necessary to make an incision in that limb as far as where the corruption stops, so that the weak one may pass away through that or escape from the greater evil which is the loss of a member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	The sign that occurs is what becomes blackened until it is considered denigrated: what fire has burnt it or what rots after the blackness; until that rottenness reaches to that which follows the affected member and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach therefore with the incision of that [affected part], and similarly if the cause of corruption is due to the strike of certain venomous creatures such as the marine scorpion, viper, weasel, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If therefore the corruption or strike occurs at the end of the finger, then cut off the finger, and leave no space for the corruption to spread, so that it does not extend to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and leave no space for the corruption to spread, until it reaches the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it penetrates into him [the patient], then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If the corruption passes through and you see him about the elbow: then death is present for the sick man.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond that in treatment, it is a question of quantity, not quality [of the medicine].
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do so with the foot, when corruption penetrates into a toe; then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches to the ball of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it rises to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure for it except to release [the limb] and leave the sick man to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting a limb or sewing it is to tighten the lower ligament that you wish to cut and tighten another ligament above the place [of the wound].
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one of the ministers [assistants] to below; and extend the other minister upwards towards the top [of the limb].
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 Separate the flesh that is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it should be cut or tied up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 It is necessary to place a linen cloth on all parts and not touch the healthy area with the knife; and harm the weak by adding injury and apply a hot poultice (to the wound).
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If there is internal bleeding while you work, then quickly cauterize the place or put some powders that absorb blood on top of it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded member with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing happening as I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 It is that a blackening occurs on his foot, similar to charring from fire, and the corruption first affects his toe, until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man went away from himself, when he saw the corruption spreading in his limb with such intensity, which he discovered by pain and charring; and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his other hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me and I tried to recover the missing tissue by placing medicines on his hand after cleansing his body; but the tissue was not restored, and it began to affect another finger; until corruption started in his entire hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He therefore called for me to cut off his hand; but I refused, hoping that the tissue would be restored by me; and I was also afraid of death at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 A man's virtue was above his misfortune.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 When he had given up hope on me, he returned to his own land; and he came to me concerning him, because he hastened, and fell all over his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 I have brought this account not except for the help on that which falls under this kind of sickness; and to signify what it indicates, and according to how it is treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Treatise on the cure of the nose, and the quality of cleansing with medications.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates, and what is in the pus comes out and leaves a place vacant as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is above it becomes like a cloth that has been worn thin; and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor does it press on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula; however, if the space of it is prolonged until corruption presses on one of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And the care of it is, that you cut that skin all over, as it is rolled up; and especially when it has become thin, and made like a cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place, due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you hope that the skin will adhere, and it does not follow from this that the ultimate corruption occurs; and if there is thickening of the skin from flesh, then treat it with Clisterium; and it is to be considered as a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large, and the pus that comes from it has a foul smell; then clisterize it with an Egyptian medication, which is vinegar, oil, and zeniar, taking equal parts, put together in a vessel: and cook it over fire, until the medicine turns red; and let it come to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it what you need and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it, and close its opening, and leave the medicine within it for two hours quantity.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then squeeze it out with pressure: make this for days until the sinus is cleansed and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes it is cleansed with water of ashes, when this medicine is not at hand for you: and there is, to receive the ash from vinewood, or ash from holly trees, and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then boil it, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the sick person cannot bear the Egyptian medicine nor water of ashes, then cleanse it with water and honey, which is already mixed with something from crushed pomegranate rind.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or cleanse it with honey and wine mixed together, because by the nature of honey it cleanses and washes, and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and thirst in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you have done this many times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then cleanse it with what causes flesh to grow within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And there is to receive dyafinicon from a plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine, or cleanse it with certain medicines and other unguents whose properties I have written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the sinus is narrow and a cannula cannot enter for cleansing, then dilate it slightly with iron, or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment within it until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if there is also a wide opening, then gather its lips with suture: and release from it the quantity to which the clyster may enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if there is an opening from which pus flows, it should be elevated to the upper part: then cut it in a lower place that is within it, so that pus may run out from below; because when pus is constricted in depth, it prevents flesh from generating in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around below as you wish, then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may run out from it easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything from the pus at all; and take healing medicines which are placed on the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such size that the entire sinus may communicate through it.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors directly in the opening of the sinus a hole wider than the opening of the sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread from soft ointments over another cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it on top with a distant position from the opening of the sinus, so that the flow of pus may be relieved; and do not remove the large cloth except after some days as if once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 He who is on the opening of the sinus, is he whom you remove at any hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may come out; and know that, whether what flows from it is much or little, or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain there, or not there is pain there, and if there is an abscess there, or not an abscess there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When therefore your medication is thus extended, and you see the material that comes out of the sinus opening, then you know that the sinus has already adhered or is approaching adhesion: then, therefore, dissolve it in the morning or on the third day; and when you cut the wound, then change the bandage and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If for a long time there comes out from the sinus subtle pus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since among men there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If for many days there comes out from the sinus undigested pus, then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then in its treatment add drying medicaments; but let the physicians do so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, such as unguentum dyafinicon, when added to it, superfluous addition from zeugion.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the most remote one that is treated, it is that you receive unguentum dyafinicon, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and let it be sprinkled on top of it ancient wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it with this and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now perform an action similar to this when you do not have unguentum dyafinicon on hand, honey, when you boil it until it thickens and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and olibanum; grind everything together and powderize it on top of honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then lay a linen cloth over it and stitch it over the sinus; and line with honey that you have boiled until it thickens, powderize the species on top of it and put it over the linen cloth, and stitch it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes it is administered to him (the patient) long aconite (Aristolochia), and the roots of celestial lily (Lilium candrum), and there is linum (flax); and wheat flour, and chicory.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use these simple remedies, or compound them, grind them well and sift the powder; and sprinkle over the honey as I have said, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the condition of the sinus continues and is not cured by this treatment, then you should know that there is corruption deep within it; or it has already affected the bones, or other hard parts of the body, or ligaments; then treat it with fistula treatment, as mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the cure for corns (calluses), scraping the nails, and cutting the finger; and incision.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Corn (callus) is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or big toe; and perhaps it arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the condition persists without treatment and it becomes an abscess, it is heated with a hot abscess; or it is corrupted and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrodes it completely, and perhaps corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it with the method mentioned, and your treatment does not help; then you should make an incision with a knife of the entire excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cautionery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and empty additions under the nail are pressing the flesh towards the inside, and begin to pierce it, and hurt it; then you should place refined radium at the corner of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it up; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on top of it what remains of the flesh from medicines for burning, corrosive, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If however a corruption has already pressed into the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it; for a corrupted bone never heals while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see a corruption and a decay advancing on the finger, then cut it off at one joint, according to what has been previously remembered about it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If however the nail is rubbed or hit and there is a very strong pain, then it is necessary to bleed the weak first with leeches.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut off the nail with a sharp Spathamel scissors from top to bottom according to sight.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And take care that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for by this you will cause a very strong pain to arise over the weak place, and it will be the cause of a new growth of flesh at that location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat the place with it in order to alleviate the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 A finger that is added to some human hands may perhaps be completely fleshy; and it may perhaps have bones in some of them, and there may perhaps be a nail on it; and sometimes it arises from the root of the joint, or its origin is at some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore that which arises at some nodes of the finger does not move; and that which arises near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore the cutting of that which is fleshy from them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 The purpose is to cut it near its root with a broad Spathamel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the treatment of that which has its origin at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In that case where a person is born on a digit at the end of the joints, then it is necessary to cut his flesh first with round incision until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidations that happen to the fingers often occur either by birth, that is, born with it, or from consolidation of wounds, burns from fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut off that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or cloth soaked in pink oil between them to prevent consolidation quickly and separate them; or place thin lead sheets between them until the area is healed as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 Similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the limb's shape.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 [Paragraph on Incision Error]
Caput XCII.	 Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Worms are involved veins that are coiled, thick, filled with excessive melancholic substances which often occur in various parts of the body; and most frequently they occur in the legs, especially in those walking or laboring and carrying loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer purges for black bile often by strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then let the patient's vein be punctured in the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The treatment for them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of these methods is to cut and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 The other method is to open the vein and draw out everything entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The cutting (operation) of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Bruise the leg first with much warm water until thick and foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the ill leg from its upper thigh to its lower leg with plaster.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut one, or two, or three wide veins.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then draw blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top and it is necessary that the leech should be used on the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut a nail if it is necessary; take out as much blood from the blood as you see sufficient and as strong as the patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it up (the wound); and command him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and leeching when the veins are full, and this harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The method of leeching is as follows.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the ill leg if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it (the leg) in a bath; or apply warm water to the limb with a linen cloth until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise it vigorously if no bath is present for him, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make a straight cut along the vein: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to sensation; and at the appearance of this, you see it turn from redness to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it has reached the flesh (vein), you see it as white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert a probe under it (the white vein) until it is drained and comes out of the flesh; hold it with a blunt probe.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another incision near that incision with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then remove it with tweezers as you did before, and hang it up with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another cut, or several cuts if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove, and cut the last part of the incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then draw out that part which is above it [the incised piece].
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do that until you draw it out from the higher incision or all incisions, until it comes out completely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you when drawing and removing: then introduce a pointed needle with a strong thread and tie it, and draw it out; or insert a rod under it; and turn your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut [the vein].
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to remove it, and harm may come upon the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have drawn it out entirely: then put linen soaked in wine and rose oil, or olive oil, over the wound; and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is twisted and contracted with a coil-like turn, not as we have said in straightness: then you must cut it open over all parts of its twisting, and the points of its coiling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it up with hooks until you remove it entirely; and be careful at your cut not to cut the vein or wound; for it will be difficult for you to remove or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, exercise caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 Method for treating a Wound.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 Method for treating a Blind Pouch (or Cyst).
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 There is no inflammation in this Blind Pouch (or Cyst) as there is in other ones, nor is it pointed, so as not to wound the vein; and it is of a thick, wavy nature, soft: for if it were subtle, it would pierce the vein with its subtlety; indeed, excess thickness should be present, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the Extraction of the Vein in the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This Vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, as Alizegi says, and in Arabian lands, and in dry, hot lands of little softness, that is, where no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Indeed, its generation is due to corruption that occurs beneath the skin, such as occurs inside the bodies of snakes and roundworms (ascarids) and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the onset of this Vein is that which occurs when there is a violent inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the area is opened (or incised).
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the Vein begins to come out from that incision, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears from there, then it is necessary to wind around it a piece of lead weighing one keil dram (273.3 grams), up to two drams and a knot; and let the lead hang down from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Every time something comes out of it to the exterior, wind that up in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it becomes very long, then cut off a part of it, and wind the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not cut it rootwise before it comes out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 If you cut [the tooth], it contracts, and enters the flesh; and it causes an abscess to occur, and corruption in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out gradually, until it comes out entirely, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein there comes forth in some men what is in its length five fingers and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because a man came out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut [the tooth] to you at the hour of your treatment; then insert a rod into its hole, and pierce it through with a long hole, together with the body, until all that is in it from matter is evacuated out; and administer the corruption of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then care for it with treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and it occurs with many openings, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Care for it, therefore, as we have said in the division, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Chapter on the section of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouina sickness.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter XCIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This sickness is called Bouina among us; because it often occurs to cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It travels throughout the body, going up and down; it is detected by sense during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts on the skin, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from corruption of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms occur in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from its mischief.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it is present in the body and raised to the head and reaches that place; then perhaps it opens there, and comes out, and destroys the eye; and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Since it is to cure him and extract it, this can be done only during his wandering and its appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one must tie that which is above it, and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut on top of him, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it sinks into the flesh, and you do not find it; then place a cautery on top of the spot with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If however you see it has reached the head near the eye; then tie under it with a good suture.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut on top of him, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick person must use purification of his body with medicines dissolving corrupting foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him beware of food causing corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on the operation for Nakir's illness.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This illness is named in our land Nakir; and it is a pain that occurs in some members; then it changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have seen it, as I told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was summoned to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 She extended her arm, and I saw a swelling smaller than a vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And when an hour had passed, I saw a swelling moving with a probe, like a worm crawls, ascending more quickly than possible to the arm, as if it were live silver running from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore receded from that place and was fixed in the arm.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then after an hour had passed, it ran through the remaining body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was revolving throughout his entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I therefore marveled at the swiftness of its transformation from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had not seen this sickness appear in my eyes in such a manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain transforming from limb to limb; and I did not see it myself as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than because the woman was one of those who are from dry bodies with visible veins; from this therefore it appears that the swoon (ventosity) was transformed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When therefore you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain; then if it appears to you as we have said, then press upon it quickly and below it; and cut above it until the swoon (ventosity) is expelled contracted; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes; then cure it with the shock of the body and with what drives out swoons and crushes them with stinking pills and pills from soporifics and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 De extractione sagittarum.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are distinguished according to their types and the places within the body where they fall.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 However, their diversity consists of the following: some have large points, small ones; concave or blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are those with three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those with tongues (points projecting from the shaft).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those with stars (multiple points or projections on the shaft).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However, those which fall upon limbs, are of two types according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For limbs are either hollow, like the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When it falls into any of these limbs and you perceive signs of death (which I shall tell you afterwards), then it is necessary to extract that arrow from it, for death will follow in the one who has it, in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And if you do not perceive these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the siphac (which is above the brain) are: as sudden fainting, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of intellect, cholera vomiting.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may flow from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech may be cut off, and voice may be destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And moisture white like plaster flows out from the wound place.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out of that like liquefied flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and withdraw the arrow if it does not flow out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow has movement like the pulse: and blood runs from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And that follows coldness of the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore you know that death is approaching without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the emission of frothy blood from the wound; and vessels that follow the neck should be stopped, and the patient's color should be changed.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it breathes out a great, deep breath: and it seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the liver, which is in the chest: then it is near small ribs; and there is great panting with very strong pain, with sighing; and all the arms are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps something undigested flows out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed there: something like feces flows out from the wound, or pus, or an already ruptured intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope for his cure, nor in withdrawing the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine flows out; and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than usual on the patient: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, as the face, neck, throat, spatula, assistant, dorsal vertebrae, collarbone, thigh, shin and similar members are saved according to several compositions when an arrow does not find the artery or nerve: and there is no venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw about these arrows, to indicate by that concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a man fell with an arrow into his tear duct in the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 So I removed it from the other side, under the cheek of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain all of it from it except a small part attached to its wood; and it was a large arrow from Turkish arrows, with soft iron, on which there were no wings.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jew was healed, and no evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabian arrow, and it has wings.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 I therefore cut across it between two gullets; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I sharpened myself with it until I removed it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I removed another arrow from a man who fell upon it in his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed without anything being changed in his condition, I cut across it (the arrow); and I opened it up; and I removed it; and he was healed, and no evil happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 I saw a man to whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her abdomen, and the wound healed over it; and the arrow remained within her; and no change was made in her constitution, nor did she find any harm from her own natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man to whom an arrow fell on his face; and the wound healed over it; and it remained, not causing him much pain; and many similar cases there were.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 I extracted an arrow from a prince of the king which had fallen on his nose, and it had already begun to turn toward the right a little; and the arrow was hidden completely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called to treat him after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found the arrow wound contracted very tightly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Therefore, I examined it with fine tweezers and did not feel it; and he himself found the prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I hoped that this was the prick from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Therefore I plastered the place with an ointment containing attracting and digestive properties, believing that the spot would open up and show me a sign of the arrow so that I might cut it; but this did not happen at the spot where it had happened, showing that the arrow had passed by.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore persisted with the ointment over him for many days; but it did not happen at the spot where it had happened, and the wound healed up in the meantime; and he remained weak from the extraction of it until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I therefore placed sharp and corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a delicate tip of the arrow which was sticking in the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added that sharp medicine into the wound opening until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow; and it passed through me with a space of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then, when the wound was swollen and I could insert forceps into it, and move it, it did not obey to come out; then I did not stop trying and devising ways over it with various ingenious means until on one day I began properly to extract it with well-made forceps according to the form given at the end of the chapter, until I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then, I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it, and the wound healed and became healthy without blemish; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extracting some arrows; so that you may put this rule and meaning on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts of this art and their definitions are not understood in narration; neither does the book contain it, and a wise artisan compares with little about much; and with what is present, over what is absent; and he discovers a new operation and a new instrument for descents of foreign bodies of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed except by two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Opposite parts of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which goes out where it came in, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and drawn out, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to come out at the hour when it fell: then it is necessary that you let it alone for some days, until the flesh around it becomes putrid; and its attraction will be lessened, and its coming out will take place.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And likewise if it has fixed itself into a bone, and does not obey to come out, then let it alone also for some days; and press it daily with attraction and motion until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not come out after several days, then it is necessary to bore around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine awl until the shaft enlarges.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it and extract it (the object).
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull-bone and has advanced into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some symptoms appear to be weak, which I have mentioned: then refrain from drawing the arrow and let it alone until the symptoms become equal.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow reaches the sinus (a cavity or duct), death does not prolong to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of a bone only, and does not penetrate up to the sinus; and remains weak for some days, and nothing happens from those symptoms: then apply skill in drawing the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed very deeply and does not obey to drawing: then administer a trepan (an instrument for boring a hole) around the arrow, as I have told you; then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow has already been concealed in the body's place and is hidden from sensation; then search for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If however you feel it (the part), then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its drawing out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot place it (the instrument) above it (the arrow), due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrowhead: and there is no bone, nerve or vein there: then pierce it (the instrument) into it, until the wound expands so that it can be possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears attached to it (the arrow), then free the fixed flesh from them on all sides, with all means possible and means, if you cannot lift the flesh above the breakage of the ears and their twisting, until it exits.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps to all parts, until it exits: and with the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its drawing out and extraction become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot place it (the instrument) above it (the arrow), then leave it for several days until what is around it rots.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat it (the procedure): the skin will relax. But if it opposes you with a flow of blood, then administer what was said in its treatment in its chapter: and be careful about damaging the vein, nerve or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer means for the extraction of the arrow in every way possible to you: and it should be with ease, calmness, slowness or firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that when you draw the arrow, it should be weakened in the shape in which it was when it happened (the accident) there.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the shapes (diagrams).
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 An arrow that emerges from the opposite part goes out to something exterior or it already protrudes from there; or it makes a hump on the tip of the arrow by sensation near the upper skin, and you see it projecting: therefore, cut above it, and let the section be according to the quantity that forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out, for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and makes a swelling for itself; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for several days; then try again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrow is made of wood, then push it with the wood.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the arrow breaks into pieces of wood, and you wish to apply force: then insert a concave tool into it, so that its concavity enters the shaft of the arrow; then push it with the same.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is hollow, then push it with the tool entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is anointed by this (liquid).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you scrape out all the flesh, in which the poison is; if this is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with what is suitable for that (to counteract the poison).
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, the abdomen, the bladder, or the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, but beware not to cut any vein or nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then cauterize the wound, if you see one, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 Extremities are like the beak of a bird, which have been made like iron: when they grasp onto an arrowhead, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 They become various, great, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its sharpness, and the depth and narrowness of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of the projectile is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of the projectile is blunt (or dull).
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is a blunt extremity like a radius to enlarge its entrance into the concave arrowhead and be driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The convexity of this projectile's extremity is concave like the feather of a bird: to enlarge its entrance into the arrowhead and be driven with it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 Chapter on phlebotomy (or venesection).

Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 Veins to be bled, whose course is customary in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Among them are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries that are visible in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Watchers; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the end of the nose.

Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 But the veins to be bled in the arms have five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is Cephalic, and it is from the forest side; and the common people call it vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	 And Black [one].

Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And the string of the arm, and it is placed on the elbow; and that is where phlebotomy is done, and that is which appears above the thumb by clear manifestation.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And Salvatella: and it is a vein that is between the annular and the minimum; and there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And in the leg and in the foot, there are three veins.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of the two veins after the Ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 But the phlebotomy of the two veins which are after the Ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and hemigranias, and sores of the head old and chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of phlebotomy [is] as I have said.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is [to be done] when the head of the sick person is shaved; and the back of his head is rubbed in the place of two veins with a rough cloth rubbing well.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person should bind his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 The places [of the ears] are behind the ears in two depressed locations on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore, search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark [them] with a hot iron.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the lancet, which is called the "Incisor".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert it [the incisor] beneath the vein into the flesh until the lancet reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then raise your hand with the vein and flesh towards above, and cut the vein and flesh with a shallow cut.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be the size of two joined fingers, or about that much, and let as much blood flow out as you want.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tie it [the cut vein] with threads, and let it heal.

The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two times [periods] is beneficial for the old hemigraine, and the sodium pressing, and the obtalmia continuous: and for the course of discharges sharp to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the manner of performing the phlebotomy [on them] is as I have told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 Let the sick man tighten his neck much until two veins appear to the sensation with a clear manifestation: and let their pulse be shown under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark them with hot iron [or a cautery].
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then raise the skin above the vein towards above with your finger as an index, and insert the lancet from below, and raise the vein towards above.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it [the vein] as you did with the two other veins: and let as much blood flow out according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then unclog the obstruction of the sick [person], and place your finger on the vein at the hour one.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place over it [the wound] and small linen cloths, and bind it from above with strong constraint; and let it be until it heals.

Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 However, the remedy for venesection of the forehead vein is after the venesection of the head, for the old diseases of the face; and for the hemicrania, and redness; and for foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of this venesection is as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The sick man binds his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the instrument called "Fossorium".
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the sharp point that is at the head of the Fossorium on the vein, and strike upon it with a pick or another similar tool in this manner; and let the blood run out according to the amount you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then unclog the perforation of the sick [person], and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide venesection.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 Nevertheless, it should not be a sharp venesection, as the other venesections, rather it should be wide.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the venesection is transverse, because the bone is near; and perhaps the venesection will be broken when it is sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on the venesection of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 However, the remedy for the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness; and for inflammation in the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 The quality of bloodletting for them is to tighten the sick man's neck with a lint bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then, do the bloodletting and you stand above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 Make the bloodletting oblique, not long, with a small lancet, wide slightly, for there is no flesh at that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the bloodletter is subtle at the end, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let it run out from his blood as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 Place a pot beneath them and tighten them at night, and loosen them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 On the bloodletting of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose, when bloodletting, are for acute fever and violent sickness of the face, such as hemigraine and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 The quality of bloodletting in this case is to tighten the sick man's neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a sharp, long lancet; and prick it in the middle of the septum, between that which separates the nose in its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein is not visible there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you hold the end of your hand slightly with the lancet; and let blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it up at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 It heals quickly by itself.

Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The bloodletting of the two veins of the cheek is beneficial for constricting cough, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic afflictions, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive, that is, herpes or skin sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that it binds the sick person under both his neck with a bandage: and the craftsman stands over the head of the sick, and the sick one sits on a chair over a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the phlebotomy vein is taken to the length of the vein, somewhat narrowly.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then take out a measured quantity of blood, or according to what you see due to necessity that is for it.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then untie the bandage, and bind two veins tightly together: so that the sick person does not bleed to death.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let it be until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 A wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 On the phlebotomy of veins, Alzahraki.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 Veins, according to Alzahraki, are useful for phlebotomy because they help with alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of teeth: and sores, bad ulcers, fissures of lips, ulcers themselves, even those that are on the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit in front of you: and bind his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left; and the demonstration of both is shown by their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true because there are small, black veins around them.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Cut therefore both with an incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt on you and you do not know which of them it is: then turn to the larger incision, and it will be more evident.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and most of all, the custom is to do so: and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 On phlebotomy: The vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 From two veins which are under the tongue, phlebotomy is beneficial: one, because phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for afflictions that are in the throat, and for throat pain, and for mouth pain.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit in front of you by the sun, and clean his mouth, and look under his tongue from one side, and from the other side a vein, and from the other side another vein: and the color of both declines to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 So, phlebotomize both (veins): and be careful, not to wound your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 Because under his are arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 On three veins at the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins which are phlebotomized at the elbow, are those whose phlebotomy has run into custom among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy of them is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or piercing with a broad-bladed phlebotome (myrtine), or oiling to the point of disappearing (oliuari), or cutting with a sharp phlebotome (cultellare) and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 So, Alnesil is that which comes to a cut (section).
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from them there are broad and narrow forms according to the width of the veins and their constriction. The form of a phlebotome (myrtine) should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is appropriate to open curved, full, proceeding, visible, thick veins and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 This phlebotomist is of lesser width and more subtle in cuts.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It suits phlebotomy of delicate veins that contain subtle, lemon-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 [Paragraph] On the Phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The phlebotomy of the Basilica, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from ailments that are below the neck and follow the chest and abdomen; therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful about this one, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If [the phlebotomist] should err and add to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist not cut that [vein] while the phlebotomist punctures; rather, it should be cut by Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Basilica does not appear in a clear manifestation, then it is necessary that you change it yourself or look for another [vein] or one of its branches; or use the arm as a substitute for the phlebotomy.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 It is clear itself, and Alnesil cuts it with the phlebotomist, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish to perform the phlebotomy of that [vein], then it is necessary before tightening the arm to touch the place, until you recognize the place pulsed.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with hot iron, then tighten the arm, and cut the vein with the concave incision with Alnesil the phlebotomist, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the puncture does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tighten the ligament, inflation in the place that you marked with hot iron, then that inflation is the inflation of an artery; therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rising at venesection, like the urine of a boy, and it is subtle, red: then you know, it is from the blood of an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore, hurry up, and place your finger over it at a long distance, then withdraw your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tie the arm and let it be: and beware that the weak do not move it: and be afraid of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood is not cut off, and it overwhelms you, and there is no medicine present with you in the moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig-tree, and fold it: take one half, and tie it over the place where the vein is constricted, with a ligature and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not: then treat it with the memory of the place from which the dust removes the flow of blood: and the cutting off of the blood of this one is not difficult in several dispositions, because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Chapter on venesection of the vein of the arm.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The vein of the arm is beneficial for venesection because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; therefore, since it is composed of a branch of the basilica vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is convenient for the venesectionist that it be above fear from venesection of it, because a nerve is under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore a nerve is struck during phlebotomy (bloodletting), and it causes a fainting spell, its healing becomes difficult, and it may not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If, however, it is concealed in some people and is subtle and not visible: then you must place your bloodletting instrument where it can reach the nerve, and make an incision with the Alnesil (an instrument used for bloodletting), avoiding the nerve with all your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If a vein is between two nerves, then you should make an incision along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Chapter on the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The bloodletting of the Cephalic Vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye problems.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is appropriate to do bloodletting in this vein with a lancet coated with olive oil or myrtle oil, because it is the safest of all veins, as it is neither an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 Nevertheless, it is advisable for you during bloodletting to avoid the head and shoulder area entirely, and to find a more gentle spot: and it will not harm if the initial strike does not hit the vein, provided that you return to the same spot with bloodletting on several occasions.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Nevertheless, it may be necessary to strike the vein again in some people when it is not struck during the initial bloodletting, but such a swelling will not harm them.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the usefulness of Bloodletting and Cautions to be Observed.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The nature and accidents of bloodletting, and the remedy for them, which you should consider when practicing it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First, you should know that bloodletting is not administered except in the preservation of health and its continuation, and as a precaution against the onset of illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And it shall be done venesection on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, the Flexor Tendon (Fusca), and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And it shall be done venesection at the beginning of Spring after a fast, and in truth (Summer), and autumn, and winter after food consumption, when signs of congestion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Venesection shall be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Venesection which is given for illness, has no specific hour; but when it is convenient and necessary for that purpose, at night or day, and in any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 It is not appropriate to venesection of children until they have reached fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Women who are pregnant shall not be subjected to venesection from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Elderly people, who have already passed sixty years, shall not be subjected to venesection.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 When someone wishes to be subjected to venesection for any reason, it is necessary that they clean their bowels before the venesection with a soft enema, if there is much retained fecal matter in them; so as not to attract veins during the venesection from intestinal superfluidities harmful to the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Patients who are affected by indigestion (toctina), that is, the satiety of nausea; nor those who are hungover (crapulatus), nor those who are coming down from drunkenness, until that has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 A patient with dropsy shall not be subjected to venesection.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Venesection shall be done with caution after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, multiplying coitus (sexual intercourse), labor, exercise, insomnia, fasting, and everything that dissolves the virtue of the body or an animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider, in the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines; if it can be done to him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Enter the bath, if it does not forbid him something: or exercise with some exercise, so that the blood becomes subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place phlebotomy on his chest, about the third day, as we said; and strive to evacuate his chest that same day with all kinds of bad events: such as anxiety, anger, fear; and with all kinds of bodily afflictions, such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him sit with those things present that are used in the custom of humans from their aromaticity, and from their smell, and from their joy and similar things according to the possibility of quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on the stool that is higher than the stool for phlebotomy; then he will withdraw his arm and rub it twice or thrice with his hand.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then he ties a ligature with a cord and wraps it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be moderated, because if the ligature is unequal or excessive in tightening, then it prevents the flow of blood; or in loosening, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after tying, it is necessary that the one being bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and become noticeable to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleanses the place of bleeding with a little old oil, specifically.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand on that vein under the place where he wants to bleed, a little; so that the vein does not run away and the blow is struck accurately.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Since it comes from the vein as you find it, like a fleeing cord during bloodletting; and from these [veins] is what is full of windiness; and when you place a lancet upon it, it contracts under the lancet, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it becomes strict; therefore, for this reason, the bloodletter should be firm, and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Draw out the bloodletter. (Incorrect translation due to incomplete sentence. Correct interpretation would be "Therefore,
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If it opens a vein from one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do the same on the other side in that place again or above it with haste; if there is no response, try another location.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If there is no response or the person faints weakly, then let him go for a day or two; and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps it attracts an abscess with heat. (The translation is somewhat conjectural based on the context of the text.)
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat bloodletting, if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or the blood flows finely and runs quickly, then fear lest an amount of blood does not come out as desired; then repeat the bloodletting in the same hole according to correctness, and add slightly more in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this quickly before the location faints, for the fainted location is common among many people during a small procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If therefore you see that it has already turned into an abscess, then do not repeat over it at all, for it does not excuse anything in front of you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 Place something from the face of oil on it; because it soothes the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And this place is better than oil itself and the rest of the olive oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil poultice in every of your bloodlettings, where you bloodlet the veins against prohibition of blood flow: and they do it Tyrian alfarach, and sagzenea, when it is placed on one of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood is made subtle and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens at the site of bloodletting a large abscess, which often occurs, especially to one who is not a bloodletter except in that case, or is a small opening of the vein, then hasten and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and press it for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 It is necessary that you make that [thing] after the exit of blood from the vein itself, when it is full, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days of blackness or greenness, it does not harm it; and if you wish, put on top of it some aloes or myrrh dissolved, or something from the juice of mint, that is to say, camphor or similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, many times abscesses and protrusions occur near phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore put your hand on it [the abscess or protrusion], then if you find softness under your compression on it, then that protrusion is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful, so that you put something from what I said [camphor or mint juice] on it [the abscess or protrusion].
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood will flow from it [the abscess or protrusion] of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make an ointment for it with that [camphor or mint juice], so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it [the abscess or protrusion] with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 It is necessary that you draw blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a clotting color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it clotted: then let it come out until it becomes thinned; and similarly if it is sharp, let it go out until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for the one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once with force, to have a vein enlargement [vena amplificetur] and be a bloodletter on that side; and for the one who is weak, it should be otherwise.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary that [he] draws it out in the veins and that there is a narrow opening: and better is what is administered in venesection, that it is a cross-section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This mode of venesection is safe from bleeding and from injury to the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 To the one who usually faints during venesection, it is necessary that he be given a small piece of bread soaked in water and honey before venesection; or if he is heated, let him be bled with leeches on three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If he is of a cold temperament, then let him take before venesection bread soaked in honey-syrup, or honey-syrup flavored with spices, or aromatic scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during venesection and the cause is excessive blood loss, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and subtle aromatic syrup; and use aromatics with alum and line his chest with it; and use the rest as mentioned in the division on fainting due to evacuation in the chapter on fainting.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 He who wishes to lose his arm and let go of his blood by the second method: it is necessary for him whose venesection is due to excessive evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he lets out his blood slowly according to the amount of his strength on consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But he who wishes to lose his arm and let go of his blood by the second method, and his body is robust: then let him do that seven or nine hours after his first venesection.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But he who wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side from which it is flowing: then let him do that on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body there is already much heated blood, which becomes sharp and causes fever: it is necessary that the blood exits from it once, and a large amount is drawn out of it; and the incision should be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and to place your hand on his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Much happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and it falls due to negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 It is not necessary when you wish to solve the arm and draw blood in the second, if the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that pressure be applied with haste on it, and it should be quickly extended.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 This is very bad indeed, rather let it be, until it can be bled in the second.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Either remove with sharpness the coagulated part of blood in the vein's opening, and place something dissolved salt in water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place upon it some from terebinth or aloe, or sage, and put pressure on it gently until the blood exits.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If, however, the vein is already cut, then let it be, and do not cover it until the abscess subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If the necessity compels drawing blood in the second, and there is no excuse, then either bleed at that spot, or in another vein of the arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The string of the arm is bled at the place of Fuscus and Basilica, when they are not found and hidden because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of bleeding him is that the weak hand should be inserted into warm water until it turns red and the vein becomes manifest.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then bind over it with a slightly loose ligature.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then perform venesection across, not lengthwise, slowly and not widely; let the opening be large, and your venesection should be on the joint of the hand somewhat.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the outflow of blood is forbidden, then immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you reach your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if it is during the summer days, then you are exempted from immersing your hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And it is highly recommended that the flow of blood into hot water takes place during wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's venesection is safer for all veins because it is not a pulsating vein and there is no nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 The venesection of the cephalic vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its venesection is that you bind the cephalic vein on the hand with a ligature or by hand after you insert it into hot water, until the vein becomes inflamed and is demonstrated strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then perform venesection across (it).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm her in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Keep it, do not go to the end of your hand with the venesection.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under that are the exposed nerves of the fingers.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood clots in the vein opening and it is forbidden from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you have extracted the amount of blood needed, then place oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from clotting quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary that you do with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The remedy for bleeding from this [area] is with the left hand. Because it is helpful for sickness of the spleen; and similarly do as you did in the second [case], equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The remedy for bleeding from the saphenous vein is helpful for sicknesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, retention of menstruation, and weaknesses of kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs of old age, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of bleeding from this [vein] is that a weak foot is to be introduced into warm water; and make friction on it until veins appear; and tie above the joint of the foot with shoelaces.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The vein's location is near the heel, visible towards the thumb; and it branches out from there into many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, bleeding should be done in a larger branch of it, or near the heel in its mass; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If bleeding is done on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your bleeding instrument as if you want to cut it across, like a knife; and the name of the one who bleeds is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If there is a prohibition of the outflow of blood, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it has been released.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the vein is missed by the one who bleeds in the first attempt, then let him repeat with bleeding to a slightly higher location, for it is safe, and do not fear harm from it when you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic nerve, as we have said, is at the calcaneum from the forest side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And its remedy for phlebotomy is, for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of phlebotomy for it is that the sick should enter the bath and hurry: and tie the leg from the side of the ankle up to the calcaneum with four fingers, with long fine bandage; for it does not appear unless for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears then, the vein should be punctured as your ability allows, either in a crossing manner or longitudinally; and it is better, either to cut it with an incision, or to sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses at all; then phlebotomy another branch of it, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot, turned towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and let the amount of blood run as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the constriction, and place the skin over the location for phlebotomy, and tie the location.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It is quickly cured.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Windbagging, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Head LXXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Wounds are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And ventilation is performed in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With incision (scarification) and bloodletting; another way of ventilation is without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventilation that is without incision is also performed in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or else it is done with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or else it is done without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places for ventilation that are administered with incision and bloodletting number fourteen on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of these places for ventilation is called Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the last on the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and ventosae Alhagdahim, which are two layers on the neck from both sides simultaneously; and ventosae menti, which is below the mandible in the lower jaw; and ventosae duarum spatularum; and ventosae Alachosos over the end of the tail; and ventosae duorum focilium, and they are in the middle of two arms; and ventosae duorum crurium; and ventosae duarum cauillarum.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And ventilation does not extract blood from small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its effectiveness is not as with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer ventilation by fire or without fire for any illness that occurs from congestion, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires ventilation due to illness or custom, we administer it at any hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and whenever it is needed.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there are people who, when their blood multiplies, until it needs to be extracted through ventilation, find a headache and pain in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from these [conditions] is he who finds swelling and redness on his face, on his head, and on his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And from these [conditions] is he who finds itching on his face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And from these [conditions] is he who scratches the place of his wind-inflammation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And from these [conditions] is he whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And from these [conditions] is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or the tongue is thrust out and cleansed the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And from these [conditions] is he whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And from these [conditions] is he who sees in his dream blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and similar things.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these [conditions], and properly if it is in the third month: then we command wind-inflammation to be made, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 But the remedy for wind-inflammation of the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what is exuded goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 However, it must be that this [treatment] is after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And indeed wind-inflammation is in the place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 But it is not allowed to use this [treatment] for one who is of cold constitution, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it causes great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for that reason, it is not proper to use this [treatment] by the elderly and in one whose head has cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But he who becomes habitual over it generates forgetfulness upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And for that reason, you should command the wind-inflator to lay down his hand with the wind-inflation briefly towards the lower parts, fearing from the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosatio or Alkehel, is a place for phlebotomy of Fuscae, and phlebotomy of Basilicae, and it corresponds to suffocation, constriction of breath, fissure of instruments breath, cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary that the Alkehel Ventosatio is pushed a little, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosatio alhagdahim corresponds to pain in the head, migraine, ophthalmia, perforation, and dental root pain; it is a place for phlebotomy of Basilicae.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And it is necessary that you advise the Ventosator not to press his hand during scarification; so as not to cut an artery and cause blood flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation below the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of gums, and similar illnesses in the mouth; it is a place for phlebotomy at another location which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation of spatulas causes alchafacham, which is caused by repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 But ventosation of the internal parts of two oval-shaped areas confers benefit to phlebotomy of three veins: Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae; because it draws blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw blood from larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And it is necessary that you advise the Ventosator not to go too deep in scarification; because the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 But ventosation that ventosates on the testicles confers hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you instruct the Venti Sorber, it should be a large windbag and made of air, since the place requires strong suction and perhaps subtle winds break; it should be cut with deep incisions.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The winds of the legs diminish by obvious reduction, since they draw blood from the whole body and bring old pains to kidneys, womb, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, cause bile and phlegm; and they are located in place of venesection of two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the remedy of Alhorcoben for winds is close to the remedy for winds of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning for winds is that you place the windbag first in an empty place, and suck with moderate suction; do not prolong the positioning of winds, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place redden and swell, and the redness appears to be blood; then scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in positioning of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For if a man is of tender flesh and few pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more; so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the Venti Sorber, to expand the incision and make it shallow; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first case, an opening is made for refining the blood and its watering; and in the second case, for a detailed examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is extremely impure, then make an incision in its place, to follow up on the last one.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And when we wish to draw blood gradually or slightly, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to draw much blood, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision, and the length of the incision equal in depth is the thickness of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which should be administered from oils for the position of Ventosaries, and what should be avoided in venting them.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the Ventosaries with open, softening, resolving oils: if it is in summer, for example, aloe oil, or olive oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or seed oil of pumpkin.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or savory oil, and similar ones should be used.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is excessive thick and cold secretion, then bitter almond oil, balm oil, white oil or dittany oil should be used, and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the venting is from large pores and soft flesh, then oil should be prohibited, and the areas of Ventosaries should be washed with rose water, cold water, salt water, pumpkin water, or purslane water, and similar ones after venting.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 The one whose blood is much moisture, should wash the ventosaries with vinegar or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 When the superfluities are gross, wash them with windy wine, or with rose water, or with anise decoction, or with chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It is necessary to avoid windiness in the bath or near the bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not necessary that someone sleeps after windiness.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is the thing that should be regulated for a Wind-sender or a Blood-letter before windiness.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that it is necessary to consider first: if the Wind-sender or the Blood-letter is choleric and bitterness and inflammation overcome his blood, then it is necessary for him to receive cooling things such as musk-grape, and also fig with vinegar and lettuce, and cucumber, and yoghurt: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place his food with young birds, and lean mutton meat, and seasoned foods with vinegar: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And when his complexion is cold, let him drink syrup made from honey or almonds, or a sauce made from cucumber seeds: and he should drink moderately flavored wine which is between old and new wine: and it is recommended that he uses little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And place his food with young birds, quails and small birds: and also pigeons for him to eat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is necessary that the drink on the day of windiness and blood-letting be more than food: and it should be given in drink to some people for hours of tarragon or alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is muscat, or ale-selle before windiness and after: so as to strengthen the main limbs, and make the blood thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not appropriate for them to take [it] in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 About Ventoses without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Ventoses which are without incision, are those placed on the liver, spleen, foot, and belly, navel, kidneys, and ankle: because these members cannot bear incision upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them, except attraction of blood from one member to another: such as placing the Ventose on the breasts in the sickness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissipate the cold humour of windiness unbearable in a member: such as placing the Ventose on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member rarefied, and warms it up, and removes pain therefore, because it dissipates that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also it is placed on the kidneys when there occurs an obstruction or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue of attraction perhaps it opens up obstruction, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And likewise it does when placed on the liver and spleen for treading windiness in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These Ventoses are applied empty, with incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in the sicknesses of pleurisy: and that is so that the Ventose is filled, and large, with only warm water, or water in which boiled herbs that agree have been steeped.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 About the form of a Ventose administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Its length should be about the size of a hand, and its width two fingers open, as we have formed it: and its depth should be half a palm: and on its side there should be a small hole, according to the quantity that is entered by the needle: made of brass or citrine, thick edges, smooth, equal, rubbed: so that it does not hurt the member upon which it is placed: and in the middle of it there should be a transverse rod of brass or iron, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now it becomes this swollen [thing], larger than we have mentioned earlier, and yet somewhat smaller than it was, according to the sickness and age of the one who is using it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For boys' swellings, and those of thin bodies, are different from the swellings of men, and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this swelling with fire on a limb is that you should kindle a linen cloth with fire properly, or a small candle from wax; and place it over the middle rung which is in the middle of the swelling; so that the fire may be ignited around the lower part of the swelling, but not burn the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is to be placed on the limb; and a finger is over the opening I mentioned, until we hold the swelling; when we need to, we remove the finger, and the vapor comes out through that opening, and the swelling is immediately resolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then, kindle the linen cloth according to its manner, and repeat it if needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In the swelling which is applied to the sickness of pleurisy with water, there is no rung across, nor an opening; and it is not administered unless because it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this swelling, when it is larger, in order to hold more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on the suspension of Sanguisugars.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Chapters XCIX. Sanguisugars are not administered in many places except in those parts of the body where it is impossible to position swellings due to their small size, such as lips, gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on denuded parts of the body, such as fingers, nose, and similar ones.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 The quality for their use is: as when coming from Leeches that are in sweet waters, cleaned of rottenness.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they (the leeches) should be let loose day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomach.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body should be evacuated first with venesection (bloodletting), and with purges (emetics).
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the sick part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then they (the leeches) are placed upon it (the cleaned sick part).
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are full and fall, and it is possible to suck the site with a purge, then it is more beneficial for healing; if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, rub and press.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood persists after the leeches have fallen off, and it is sweating, then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it upon it until the sweating stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the blood increases, then sprinkle powdered zaffran (zegi) or gall nuts and similar substances from the poppy on it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or lay half-peeled beans on the place, and let them stay until the beans stick to the spot, for the blood will stop flowing.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary to repeat the use of leeches when possible, if they are needed.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If leeches are forbidden from being suspended, then cleanse the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or make an incision in the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them (the leeches), for they will stick immediately when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you wish for them to fall, sprinkle something from crushed aloes, salt or ashes upon them; they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Third Part.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, and Treatment of Torsions and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This Chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine; it is the restoration of a fracture and dislocation of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O Sons, that foolish doctors and the common people boast about this Chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book or read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And therefore, because this method is lacking among the learned in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never encountered it in a good way, and I have not attained that knowledge from it except for the length of reading ancient books and my diligence in understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I have applied the experiment and diligent study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 Now I have described to you everything that my knowledge contains on this Chapter; and beyond what my experiment has failed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and released it from the prolongation of the explanation, and abbreviated it at the end of the abbreviation, and shown its conclusion; and I have formed many forms of instruments that are applied in it, since it is an addition of a decline, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collections on the existence of bone fractures, which is necessary before we begin the reminder of broken limbs and various ones, if of any one.
Caput II.	 Chapter Two.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this Chapter the sums and Chapters, to whose understanding the craftsman must be directed first to his station regarding their truth; namely, so that you and those who are ready know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say, therefore, that when anyone happens to have a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall: then it is necessary, firstly, to rush to let blood from him, and to solve it, or both at the same time: unless something forbids it, such as weakness of strength; or it happens to someone who is a child, or an old and decrepit person; or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Let him be content with his own food, cold vegetables, beans and hedgehogs; and let him abstain from wine, large meat portions, and filling himself up with any food or all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until he is secure from a warm abscess, and does not fear the outflow of matter to a limb; then let the sick person return first to his own regime, with which his custom usually runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nourishing foods in abundance, thick, heavy, with viscosity; such as food made from boiled wheat and water, rice, heads of animals, hooves, entrails of cattle, eggs, fresh fish, thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this regime, the healing of the fracture is made more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their nature always, due to the drying of their members; and they consolidate and hold together those which are from them at the end of softness, like the bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue around the broken bone from every part, in which there is thickness, so that it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated on both sides, and bind together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until something forbids it by its operations; and because of this reason it is necessary to put the nourishment of the sick person in foods which have thickness, viscosity, and heaviness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the differences of the limbs; for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the head bone; and the fracture of the chest bone is different from the fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other members are diverse one from another; and I come with the reminder of all types of fractures explained in their respective chapters distinctly from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fractures are also diverse within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 As for the bow-shaped fracture, there occur stars (spicules) in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 Sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and such fractures are called 'stars', that is spicules, or additions proceeding from them, as they are in a reed when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 Neither proceeding; and there is a fracture with wound and rupture in the head; and there is a small cleft fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every kind has its skill or specific tool for restoration, according to which its memory will come, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from the fact that a bone fracture is known, its curvature and its prominence appear to the senses; and its appearance sounds when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore no curvature appears in its place nor does pain occur with your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does a weak great pain arise; then there is no fracture there, indeed it may be a curvature or a small cleft; therefore it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression at all, but rather lay medicines upon it, whose memory comes after the appropriate time; then a ligature is tightened with subtle binding.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when a place bows and splits into two, there occur stars (spicules) in it, yet all parts are separated from each other; then you must begin from your hour for its correction, by aligning it before abscess (pus) hot (comes).
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If however a boil becomes hot, then let it be left for some days until the boil subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then lance the abscess according to whatever method is possible with kindness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it (the abscess) and its equalization is easier than that of a bone, in which fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it (the abscess) according to when you remember about it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If however there are fractures in the bone, then extension of this fractured member from two parts is necessary, whether it is a hand or a foot; or with your own hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be such when you place the member over an equal place according to its natural shape, until the parts of the fractured member extend; then strive to bring back those additions with all skill and in whatever way you can at their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain occur in a weak person due to your operation, nor injury; and strive according to your strength to apply one of two bones with its partner, according to the best shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary that at that hour you try and touch it (the fractured member) with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to the quantity of your force.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For many times they cause boils to appear due to their operation or a contraction in the member; as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then attach after equalization, and a proper operation, and constriction of that member, and calmness, and peace; and warn the weak one about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 Make him be careful not to move himself during his hours of vigil, and during the turning of his sleep, and during his agitations, and during his digestions, and all his movements with utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 Make him be careful that the position of a member will not follow pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 Because when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of a member's position, then it is necessary to change his position into another that does not cause him pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 Be careful that his position is equal and straight so that it does not happen that there will be deformation in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the tightening of a broken member, as I said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken members are diversified according to their size, and the magnitude of their parts, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Therefore, those that are small, such as the arm, and finger, and tool, and similar to them, then it is necessary for there to be a soft, subtle wrapping of cloth around them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 But those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, firm wrapping around them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a broad bandage connects a large member and tightly binds it from all sides with an equal tightness, so that no spot is left open.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment on it, on a soft woolen cloth over the place of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the bandage around the place of the fracture three or four times, according to what the member deserves, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go with him to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous tightening that you had at the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then gradually extend yourself from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the constriction slowly, until you take out a large piece from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another plaster and apply it again over the fractured place with folds.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then go downwards with folds towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in the constriction of the fold and its softening, as we said in the first fold above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then put between the folds from soft wool or cloth that corresponds to the twisting of the fracture if it is twisted: and if not, do not place anything there.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then fold again over the other plaster.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place stars evenly on these folds immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is a swelling or an abscess there: then place on it what sits on that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tie the stars over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the stars be from the middle parts of wide canes, shaved, well-formed: or let them be from wood where sieves are made, which are made from pine, fir, or palm branches, or boxwood: and let the width of each star be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the star that is placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and wider than the other stars: and the length of the star should be according to what fits the limb in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tie with another plaster over the stars according to the first constriction.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then tie above with cords evenly, as we said about the constriction: and let your constriction be over the fracture place more: and the more it is extended from the fracture, the less the constriction.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it is necessary that the threads are medium-sized and fine, and they should be made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 If the threads are thick, as I have seen stupid people using twisted threads of coarse linen in their operations, it is a great mistake: because the constriction falls out with them beyond its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And fine threads again do not agree: because you will not achieve with them by constriction what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between the astellae (metal needles or pins used in surgery).
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick person is hurt by the tips of the astellae after constriction in healthy places: then place beneath them with soft wool or camouflaged wool until nothing is hurt from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with wound, and it happens that the break-up occurs on the skin, I shall come again with its reminder to the second chapter of singularity (specific cases).
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken member must be bound with pins from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 That is, because when the member is large, it is not necessary to place needles above it, unless after five days or seven or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of an abscess from a hot wound.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of plasters which the ancients used to restore that are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 Common emplaster method abbreviated, restoring the fracture, suitable for multiple temperaments, especially women and children, because it is from that which heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is that you should take from the flour mill dust, and it is the marrow of the wheat that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the grinder; and prepare it in this way, except that you sieve it with egg white; and place its mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plastering (bandage), for setting a broken bone, and reducing a dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath: and steep all of them in ten parts of myrrh, and five parts of both aloes, and twenty parts of alethil: grind everything, sift it, and mix with the water of alethil; or with sheep's milk whey if the bandage is heated for a sick person.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it quickly sets broken bones, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of plastering (bandage), which also benefits a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugath, mess, white alteae, all in ten parts of myrrh, and five parts of both aloes, six parts of Armenian pitch in twenty parts: grind everything well, sift it, and make with water or sheep's milk whey: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of plastering (bandage) for joints and bones separated from their places: it relieves the pain that occurs to them, and stops the splitting of the bone, and the break.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take raw wool, immerse it in vinegar, and boil it in oil: place it over the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed, there is no virtue of restoration in this plaster, but it is good for the treatment of a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method of plastering (bandage), which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the deaf fig, and leaves of wild papaver: grind everything, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another shortened method of plastering (bandage), used for the restoration of a broken bone: and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Make a mixture of the root of althea, chamomile, marshmallow flowers, and barley flour, taking equal parts of each: grind all and make it with wine, unless the member is already heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is already heated, then use that mixture with coriander water or just water.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 A stronger method of plaster for resolving a hard abscess during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Make a mixture of the root of althea, linseed, beechwood, medick, samsuc, marshmallow flowers, chamomile, taking equal parts of each: grind all and make it with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply the mixture to the member according to its warmth and the calmness of the heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on a broken member during its restoration, except for a plaster made from beeswax and oil: nothing else; and he said it should be of a medium consistency between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen, however, seemed to think that something should be placed on a broken member during its restoration which has the ability to draw out heat, such as myrrh, aloe and frankincense, and similar substances from what we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 A method of plaster for treating injuries and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Make a plaster from mugath, chickpeas, cut human hair or bird feathers, althea, and salt in equal parts: grind them all into powder, and make the plaster out of it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount of plaster that should be used, so that the bandage remains in place, is as follows: you should then loosen it if there is no persistent pain, itching, or the bone moves from its place: then do not loosen it for several days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happens to him at the place that there is violent itching, or troubling pain, or swelling: then hurry and dissolve it in an hour himself, and remove the plaster from him: and take soft cloth, or sea sponge, moist: and submerge it in warm water, and wash with it the place until the itching subsides, and the pain sits still.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place upon him a piece of flax soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night until you are sure of the disappearance of the hot inflammation, and the swelling rests, and the pain is removed from it.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed with a subtle bind and a small plaster: do not bind it tightly at first with your tight bind, but gently with the thin one until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you need a plaster and bind, then proceed with it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what we mentioned happens to the limb, then do not dissolve it before three, four, five or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is discharged after twenty days, according to what appears to you from the dissolution of the limb, as we said, until when there remains a fracture and adherence of coagulated flesh on it: add also in the bind more than your first bind, and also in the thickening of food, according to what was mentioned before its remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see the place of fracture already to dry out and become thinner than necessary: then know that nutrition is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Boil the ointment with warm water in every place where you dissolve it, and let it be for three days, and loosen slightly the stricture (or narrow passage).
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 What foolish restorers do instead of a limb fracture, when it is not restored as it should be at first, and it is restored according to its curvature, is an error due to their operation, and there is great fear: And if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen anywhere the trace of such a thing, and it is more correct that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on making an incision in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Types of fractures are diverse, and their shapes numerous; their causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For from a fracture is that which occurs by striking with an edge: and striking removes the bone entirely to the extent it reaches the siphac (a soft tissue beneath the bone), just as an ax does in wood; and for this reason, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the edge of a sword cuts some bone and only cuts its surface, but does not penetrate through the incision to the end; and this type of fracture is called Calcani, that is, Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are two types of wounds in fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture is that which is crushing or grinding; and its cause is striking with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also penetrating, which already approaches the panniculus (a fatty tissue beneath the skin), which is under the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two types of fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from a fracture, which is hidden within the bone in subtlety like hair, is a small split, and because of this it is called this kind of fracture Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these (kinds of fractures) is a fracture that happens by accident or striking with a stone, and those like them that make the bone plate to penetrate into the inside, and it becomes concave at that place: just as it happens to the caldarii (metalworkers) of iron, when they are struck and part of them penetrates into the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Most certainly, this happens in moist skull bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 All these kinds of fractures are made with sawing and separation, and I will come back to the subject in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We recognize all these kinds of fractures by examination over it, and investigation of them with tests, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary kind is recognized by this, that it shows on the bone, is scraped off, and a thin layer is laid over it with pitch: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In treating a fracture, first consider the condition of the sick person: if you see from the conditions that it indicates a clear sign of fear, such as cholera vomiting, extension, loss of intellect, absence of voice, fainting, acute fever, discharge of eyes, redness of them and similar things from other conditions in various dispositions, there is certainly no recovery: and if you see the conditions not frightening to you, and hope for health, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If someone comes to you wounded in the first place when he is wounded: and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you study in the removal of the bone before the 14th day according to all dispositions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupt beneath the bone from the fat, and such accidents happen as we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of the bone has already reached the fat touching the brain and is accompanied by fragments and traction: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and smoothed part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is to be shaved the head of the wounded: and dig on top of the bone as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on what is weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during the digging of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is to fill the place with rags soaked in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the abscess settles down, and be safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 The first method is to cut the bone with a knife having a narrow blade: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another knife, narrower still: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer yet another knife, wider still.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 The second method is that there should be with you a number of different knives, some of which are wider than others, and some of which are shorter than others: and they should have their edges at the extremities sharpened, and made of steel or iron that has been hardened: and use them with ease in striking the knife, so as not to concuss the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and firm: then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer Incisoria, with Terebris which are named Terebra not penetrating deeply; they are not called so because they do not pass beyond the bone's marrow to what is behind it, since the tip of the Terebra is rounded above what is under its head and sharp, like an edge, and a small circle prevents it from being submerged and passing through the bone's thickness.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is necessary that you take a large number of Terebris from these, one for each thickness of the bone, until there is Terebra for every part of the skull; whose sharp tip's length and width should be according to the thickness of the said skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of Terebrums or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of boring around the broken bone is: that you place a Terebra on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Terebra to another place, and place what is between every hole of a size corresponding to the thickness of the radius or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the Incisoria between every hole from the bone: and make it thinner than possible above that from the edge of softness, as we said, until you extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for this purpose: such as tenaliae, and subtle forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you be careful to avoid with the greatest care that the Terebra or the Incisoria touch any part of the siphac [a type of horn used for surgical instruments].
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you are boring around the bone and separating it from the siphac [horn], if it is continuous with it and you extract it, it is necessary that you smooth and even its remaining part on the bone with another similar tool, like an Incisoria.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 It is necessary that it [the instrument] should be thin and subtle more than other cutting instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of small bones or cartilage: then take it with ease, along with what you have at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then, care for the wound afterwards with lints and the ointments that I mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy, completely free from fear: which Galen said and praised greatly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin by uncovering the bone fragment from the place where the fracture is more violent and visible: until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of this curved cutter, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The curved part of the cutter does not cut anything: and the sharp end of it on both sides going along its length, as you see: so that the curved part may be fixed to the handle, its sharp edge falling on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike on the cutter from one side with a small hammer until you have cut through the whole bone easily, as it is turned: and be careful that the cloth does not slip off what happens accidentally, which you should fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and less ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the end of the curved cutter and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its face, and roughness and subtle cartilage remain in it: then it is necessary that you scrape away the roughness, and excavate the cartilages with sharp scissors of various quantities which you have prepared, so that it may be possible for you to apply them more appropriately in every place according to what the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 It is necessary that you administer [the operation] according to your reason, firstly by sawing the bone, more widely with these retractors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer instrument after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 Do not cease to do it in continuity until you reach administering [it] thinner and finer of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In every small remaining crack or fine fracture, it is necessary that you apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a matter that is not hidden upon all [things], to which any study in this art stands, and it has stood over what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If a piece of flesh is detected and retained when you are removing bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another double or triple piece of linen cloth, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first one; do what you can easily over it, so as not to burden the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a wide ligature over it; do not tie it, unless to the size that holds the wound only; and release it with this care for one day or two days until you are secure from warm inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it [the ligation], and administer after that medications with which there is excessive dryness; such as the roots of garlic, and grain of herb, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar ones; and it is to make a powder from these medications, which will be applied to the wound like those [medications] that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer all medication in it of the property which is to purify and not corrode [the wound].
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your virtue, that the wound in your treatment is clean: neither let there be dirt of ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not allow pus to accumulate on it at all: because when pus gathers upon the brain tissue, it corrupts it and makes it putrefy, and afterward great harm occurs to the sick person after that; and already it has happened on the scalp of the head, when the bone is cleansed by him, especially when the care for it is neglected, a blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if the accidents that I have mentioned occur to the sick person, know that it is certainly dangerous (or fatal).
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if the blackness does not occur except from the medicine placed on him and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make it black: then you should take one part from honey and three parts from rose oil, and anoint it with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the scalp; afterward take care of it with appropriate remedies for healing until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the nose when broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except for two of its upper parts simultaneously, or one of them: because they are two bones; since below it is cartilaginous, it does not break, and harm such as attrition, twisting, or swelling does not occur to it unless there is attrition, twisting, or inflammation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and align the fracture with your index and thumb fingers from outside until the nose returns to its normal shape: and do this skillfully, easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful that no pain occurs to the sick person through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If a fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it cannot be reached by a finger: then, it should be adjusted at the end of the radius, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If [the injury] happens to be in two parts, then make it similar [to the other side]: and advance with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at a place quiet for cauteries of warm water.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of flax from linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part: or insert two pieces if the fracture is in two parts: and there should be a bulge of such size on the flax that it fills the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancients who were restorers said that flax should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But I do not see this [method] as good, rather it should be soaked in egg white made with flour mill powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release the flax when the bone has hardened and the cartilage has become hard.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 Sometimes a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose in place of the flax, after soft cloth has been placed over it: and this holds the nasal fracture more firmly, and prevents the weak from being prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do it: if you don't want, do it with flax.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose again develops a cautery while working on an abscess, pack the nose with linen soaked in tar, or with pitch infused in rose oil, or with a little turpentine.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if it does not develop a hot cautery, then the nose should be packed with flour from sesame seeds and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth on top of it (the wound), and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If however the nose bones are broken in a small fracture or ground down, then it is necessary that you make an incision over them and extract them with instruments suitable for the purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then either make an incision and take care of it with the one that coagulates and consolidates with plasters suitable for that purpose, or with ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If it should happen that a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with linen cloths, and to administer a lead cannula until healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is disrupted and the fracture is not with a wound: then observe whether its fracture is only outside and it does not break into two and bends towards the interior: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 If the fracture is on the right side of the bone, you must insert your left index finger into the diseased jaw: Similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: And push the swelling of the fracture gently towards the outside with your other hand properly from the inside part of the bone and with it, equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to apply traction from both sides according to correctness until its alignment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 But if already there is movement or disruption of the teeth, then bind those which you hope remain with a thread of gold, silver or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place on the broken jaw a piece of raw hide.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double cloth and put on the large cross made well over it or an equal piece of shoe leather, in length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above as your binding for it is ready and its application is suitable until it does not break: And instruct the sick man to rest calmly and quietly: And put his food in mild broths.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you estimate that something has changed in its shape in some way: Then hasten and cut it open on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then adjust what has changed from it, and cover it with plaster from milled flour mixed with egg white or wheat flour, after you have removed the raw hide: And put over the plaster a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that adhesive plaster remains on it, and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it be without removing it until it heals; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a warm boil occurs in the meantime, then administer what I have said repeatedly for its reduction until that boil is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If a piece of bone is already separated from the bone or from a tendon, then be subtle about it, to remove those pieces of tendon along with whatever suits you for their removal from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the wound opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a leech according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed the tendon pieces, and there remains nothing of them, or if the wound opening is wide: and if not, place on it ointments that suit for that, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the Fork (when it breaks).
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The fork is broken most frequently from the anterior part of the shoulder, and its breakage occurs in one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks into two parts, with tendons possibly involved: and this is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or it happens so that there are pieces of bone involved: and this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or it is a break with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in this case when the break is without a wound is that you have two assistants present, one holds the limb with the broken fork, and the other extends the neck toward the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then you should align the broken part with your fingers until its shape is correct; and there should be neither a projection nor a hollow.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you require more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's wound sphere made of cloth or wool; and let its size be according to your need; stretch and elevate the lever, and compress the sphere with your hand until it equals the fracture, as needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the extremity of the lever outside: because it has reached deep: then it is necessary that the patient lies on his neck; and place under his shoulder a saw medium in size, and press the minister of his shoulder towards the lower part, until the bone of the lever that is in the depth rises upwards: and then correct the fracture, and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If however you feel a splinter from the lever and it moves: then it is necessary that you probe over it, and remove the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If however it is retained in the bone, then apply an instrument of incision that you have prepared for this purpose, after you place under the lever a tool which saves silk: and the tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to the bone you need it for and its size.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length of it also, as far as possible for your operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And have two ends, as you see: and one end should be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the wound which you have cut when you remove the splinter of bone is wide and gaping, and sews itself with hot cautery: then join together two lips of the wound with stitching.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the wound is small or you fear hot cautery: then fill the wound with cloths and wool according to the size of the wound cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 However, if the bone is constricted without a wound and without incision, it should be covered with a plaster made from milled flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft wool on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then put a small ball under its pulsation, if needed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a bloodletting instrument, that is the rotula which the Saracens hold, which should be very long; and its width should be one palm or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a folded piece of wool over the soft wool and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then fold it into the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then fold the cloth with the awl into the place of the incision over the fracture and the site.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then apply the incision to the fracture as it is described, and fold it over the neck of the healthy side and the weak side, and under the pulsation of the healthy side and the sick side: and bring it over the entire part, so that it is clear to you how the constriction holds the fracture correctly: and this should not be hidden from you, and all of it, so that the awl does not remove the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, it is necessary to examine the sick side every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 When does the ligament soften and you see that the awl has already been removed? Then adjust it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and put a small pillow under its pulsation near its sleep at night, so that when it rises, help comes to its side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Lift therefore the fracture of the clavicle by lifting the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Tie the arm to his neck; do not loosen the bandage unless it happens due to an incident caused by itching or abscess, for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards that (the affected area).
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the constriction, and let it be, until it is restored and hardened.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the clavicle is bound and supported as much as possible for twenty-eight days; sometimes it heals more quickly in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the spatula (scapula).
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The spatula is seldom broken, and at its wide end: and it is not broken from anything except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it is broken from that place, and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch, then according to its figure prepare the treatment for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it to its natural form by any means of your intellect that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place upon it powder of millstone with egg white, and soft starch, and place on top a small piece of double cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place upon it a broad awl from thin wood according to the quantity of the spatula or larger by little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however there is a depression under the awl at any part of the spatula, then fill that depression with soft starch until the awl descends according to its equal level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bind on top with long alum thread in an appropriate constriction and the firmness of the awl until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever therefore the binding becomes soft, bind it again, and if the awl is moved from its place, let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And the spatula certainly recovers in twenty days or forty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is complete, then loosen the binding: and you will be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is made from bones whose breakage is not feared nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If however a fragment of bone protrudes and pierces under the skin, then cut through it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said in the fracture of a collarbone from cauterization by hot metal, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 § On the restoration of a breast fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Head VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Chest occasionally breaks in the middle of itself, and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities indeed break more often than the chest itself does, due to its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle of it breaks down and tends towards the lower parts, it causes a very strong pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, perhaps vomiting blood, and a hollow appears in the fractured bone that is not concealed to the sense; The restoration of this is to lay the weak one on his back, and place between his shoulders a poultice.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders, and apply the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands; Subtly cut in the equator of it, according to all possible ways that this can be done and fit, until the figure of the bone returns, as required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on it an emplaster and a plaster, and place above it a small star from a thin wood, such as willow or chalice, and others like them, after you fold it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then subtly tie it on the broken bone so that it is not removed; and go around with the bandage according to its roundness to the back several times, and bind it tightly with a suitable binding.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bandage in every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; And if necessity of its dissolution arises due to itching or corrosion that happens at the place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and dissolve it, remove the poultice, and correct what happened with the treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then return the poultice if you see it towards that face; And attach a binding to it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on Restoration of Ribs when they break.
Caput IX.	 Head IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 You should know that the fracture of a costa does not occur except in thick places following the back, and from their extremities starting from the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not happen to them by rubbing, unless for this reason: because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of such a thing is not hidden from sensation during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of it is done in such a way that the fracture is adjusted with fingers according to the possible method, until the shape is made even, as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint if it requires one.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture of a costa is towards the interior: then a severe pain occurs in the weak, and puncturing, just as puncturing that which happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood much: and this is difficult for treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients were skilled in this with many devices; and among them are those who say that you should place food for the weak which generates inflammation and wind, so that the stomach is inflamed, extended, and pushed outwards to move the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We rather avoid causing a quick cause for making a hot abscess if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 But if it has already occurred, then you can add it to that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: place a windy substance on the spot, then press it strongly, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, it is feared that a windy substance will attract excess to the spot due to the weakness of the arrangement.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool already soaked in hot oil; and lice should be placed between the ribs until it is filled up; so that the binding will be equal when you pull it off according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick one is treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the affliction presses hard upon the sick one and it cannot be borne, and if we prick the wound with a lancet, causing pain, and we fear for the sick one: then it is necessary that we make an incision above the affected place, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we shall place upon it an instrument which serves as a saw, whose recollection has been mentioned earlier: and we shall cut the bone easily, and we shall cut it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we shall bring together two lips of the wound, if it is large with stitches: and we shall heal it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If an abscess occurs in the meantime which is hot, then hurry, and pour powdered pig's bristles into sweet oil, and place it over the spot: and the sick one shall be treated with it as appropriate for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime also let him lie upon his side on that side which he sleeps, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they rub against each other; and similarly for the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 If such a thing happens to anyone, and you wish to know if it will heal or not: then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see his hands already softened, stunned, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor does he feel pain in them: then you will know that it will not heal, and in more than one condition it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and the prick: then you will know that the neck bone is safe, and that the broken one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If such a thing happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know if it will heal or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened and the same thing occurs in them as in the hands: and then when he lies on his back, wind comes out without will; and when he lies on his stomach, wind comes out without will; and when he lies on his back and wishes to urinate, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor in the treatment of it.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing similar happens to him, it is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for such a thing that happens to him is, you should apply hot oil to the rubbed vertebra; so that you place hot oil on the softened vertebra alone; or with sheep wool soaked in vinegar.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on the same thing several times a day, until when the hot abscess is quieted: then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters on the location, and bind it tightly with a bandage; and tell the sick person to rest quietly and peacefully.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He should not sleep over a part where he found pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens by the fracture of the bone, or something that is separated from it: then it is necessary that you lay on the skin, and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of himself with some ointment, until healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of the ulna is broken and it is the end of the shin: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and equal the fractured bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and by second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place him on it, and remove it: and take care of the wound with the treatment that preceded, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on the repair of the anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely do the bones of the ankles break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they break, then the fracture of these bones is not anything other than a comminution at their ends; and they are cut through lengthwise, and they bend towards the inner parts; and there occurs pain in that place, and puncture; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the repair of it is that you extend your hand over it until you are standing over the fracture in its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at their ends, then equalize that fracture, as much as possible, according to your preparation, until it becomes similar in its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is through length or already bending towards inner parts: then make the weak lay on his stomach until the preparation for repairing that fracture is ready.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you equalize it, place ointment on it; then place a splint of wood or hide over it; and tighten the bandage above it, so as not to fear movement of the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And let the cavities [of the body] be equally concave with what they contain, until they are seized by a ligature in accordance with their equality; and command the sick person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If, however, an abscess becomes hot: then cease from extending it and its healing until the hot abscess is seated; and place on him what sits upon it as previously, then return to its healing; and ligature it as needed.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If, however, it should happen that a fracture occurs in the bone, or if it is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the healing of fractures. Aid is given.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula [tool].
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it should break, then its healing is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One method is that you take a flat board of medium thickness, in the following shape:
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two ligaments shall be tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place, and let the sick man sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then cast his broken arm upon a log until it reaches the notch of the same log, where the break of the log is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then place something heavy above him to stretch him towards below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician sets the break with his hands until it returns, as is required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another method is that the sick man lies down on his neck and suspends his hand from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then order two servants to hold one above the break with their hands and let another hold below him and stretch each of them in turn.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for the extension to be stronger, then bind under the break with a rope and above it with another; let each of the servants stretch in turn towards their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the break is near the shoulder joint, then it should be bound under the notch and another above towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the break is near the elbow joint: then it should be bound above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then set the break easily without exertion, until it is aligned as required and a good dressing is applied; then bind it if no hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then refrain from binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place a linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil on him until the abscess subsides; then bind it and the method of binding is to place an ointment over the break.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then lay a new cloth over the ointment.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm upon the same support, and place his open hand upon his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place the cloth and bind the arm to the support, so that the arm remains in place like a star; if it does not prevent you from doing anything or if nothing alters on you due to a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something may change due to a broken bone, then use stars; and there is one which you place over the fracture itself, which is broader and stronger than other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place the width of every star at the length of a finger; and let the length of stars, with an addition of three fingers, be from all sides regarding the fracture.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind on the stars as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is to be so that your binding is closer to the place of fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 As the fracture extends more, the binding shall be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of stars and binding, as we have said, at the hour when you restore a limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the binding and stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the binding in all three days, so that itchiness, swelling or food does not reach the limb due to the surplus of binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore correct this matter as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it; then do not release the binding, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the sick person lie on his back and place his hand on his stomach; and place under the support a wool blanket full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And consider at all hours of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb does not loosen and that the binding is not softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct this altogether with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place the food for the sick according to the order which we have prescribed, so that it is a subtle food first, until the bone begins to be bound; then it is necessary that you increase its size.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of assistance and the leg is that it should be bound for forty days; then it is necessary that it is loosened, a bath is given, and it is treated with ointments which correct this.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen from it the bandage and pegs for fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 On the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and that is the one which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is the one which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Perhaps only the larger forearm bone is broken, or perhaps both are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 If the smaller forearm bone above is broken, then the restoration of this is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower forearm bone is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And this is worse when both bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the doctor in its restoration, to place an extension smaller with ease until it is equal to it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however the larger forearm bone is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to place a strong extension.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand at its restoration, and its extension extended above the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers; and the inferior joint should be higher than all the fingers or remaining [parts]; and if the patient is weak and sitting, the cubit bone should be square with respect to itself, and the pulley should be in front of it or directly above it at an appropriate height so that the weak patient does not suffer labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the attendant extend the arm from its lower part, either with his hand, or with a rope.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another attendant shall extend it likewise from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician shall equalize the bone until he can reduce it to its best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are shards in a bone fracture, then try to reduce every fragment into its proper place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that a shard is separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then fill it over with material as we have mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have made a special chapter for that: therefore receive its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then prepare linen cloth with wax made from rose oil, and white beeswax, and its consistency should be between thickness and fineness; then wrap the linen cloth around it tightly with a thin string until the abscess subsides; then remove the wax, and apply an ointment prepared from flour mill powder and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a splint, and let the splint placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements; whether it is a fracture in one splint or two splints together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place a stronger and firmer strap over the location of the fracture, and apply it somewhat more to the upper or lower part of the fracture; or place a softer strap slightly below the one mentioned earlier, according to what was remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 The fabric that is wrapped around a fracture should be soft, wet and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 The thread with which it is stitched should be made from flax, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens requiring correction, such as an itch on the limb: then it is necessary that you apply warm embrocation to the limb with hot water until the itch subsides, and leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then repeat binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the binding has already been softened and the bone already removed, and similar cases: then you should correct it with your power, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 If nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excess binding, then it is necessary to soften it a little and leave it for some days until it goes towards nourishment, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of those things that were mentioned occurs in the sick one, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days or about this much.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick man is suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be kept straight and guarded with your power against violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is restored within thirty or thirty two days; it may perhaps be restored within twenty eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All this is according to the dispositions of the constitutions and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures: Hand.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the break in the hand by combing and knots of fingers is rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him except through excessive rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When a fracture or abrasion of the foot occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sits on a level seat next to him.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended (the injured part).
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then let the attendant spread out the broken bones, and let the physician align them, until they join together well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place plaster and wool (linen), if no hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the location, and you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is near the heel of the foot, then make something like a ball from cloth: and tell the sick person to tread on it with his injured foot: then tie it up with long linen cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made of soft leather, with which to apply it to the skin of the foot: and tie it on as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is at the outer side (of the foot), then it is necessary to place one splint on top and another one underneath the foot, and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a support, as the hand is rolled (into a tube): and extend it between the fingers with a ligation.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there should be a fracture in any of the knuckles (of the fingers), if it is the thumb, then let it be aligned as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie it to the sole of the foot (the injured hand): and if it is a finger, place a straight splint under it, smaller than usual, so that the fracture may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the remaining fingers (such as the middle finger, index, little finger or ring finger), then let it be aligned and tied to the healthy digit that follows it, or tie them all together following their order: this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Place a small pin over it (the wound), as we said on the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration, and after the arrangement of the incision of hot cautery: and oppose it with what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to its repetition of his narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a broken hip.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thighbone (Femur) often breaks and becomes noticeable to the senses because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 The restoration of it (the thighbone) is done in such a way that a ligament is tightened above the fracture and another ligament below it.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the weak one (patient) stretches himself over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then, stretch out every ligament that serves for its side according to equality; and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If, however, it is a fracture near the root of the hip (acetabulum), then let there be a ligament towards the side of the ilium, so that the extension falls upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly, if it is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee so that the extension falls towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he returns it to its natural shape; and joins the bone by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you place an ointment and a bandage, if no abscess appears on the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs there (on the limb): then leave it for some days until the abscess becomes warm, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage of this should be in such a way.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary that you wind a hard linen (or bandage) over the fracture; and fold it twice or thrice, so that there remains an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then fold the leg (or thigh), until the heel reaches the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 Insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the thread come out from the lower parts (of the two parts).
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll up the leg and thigh what remains over from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place a small star on the hip at the site of the break, and place another star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that it is bound tightly.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Begin (the bandage) strongly from the middle of the break in three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend (the bandage) away from the site of the break with the rope, let your bandage be looser and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct (the ends of) the thread that you inserted between the hip and the leg, towards the two ends.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars on each end.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tighten (the bandage) also with the ends of the stars on both sides, so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then let the bandage remain there until the bone is healed, so that no rot is caused to the limb, no abscess, no swelling, and similar things happen.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 But if something happens from that (the bandage).
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach it (the problem) then with the solution of it, and correct everything that happens from there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 But if there is a piece of bone sticking out from the broken bone: then it is necessary that you cut it off, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not (you can remove the bone piece with a cut), then place a bandage on it, and take care of the one who preceded the reminder, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this hip fracture is tightened, even when additional studs are added, as we said in the aid and in the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in the treatment of this broken hip, it does not occur that the lame limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip tightens within fifty days, or is increased too little, or decreased too little; all of this is according to the diversity of temperaments and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Chapter on the restoration of a knee joint fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee joint rarely breaks, but it often wears down (or wears away).
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if it occurs that it is broken, then it is not other than a split or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 It is with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And it stands on top of the whole thing with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And the restoration of it is thus: It is made equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers until it is gathered together and joined according to what is possible through equality, ease, and skillful craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster from wheat flour or milled wheat, with egg white; and place over it a round stud, if needed; and tie on top with a binding appropriate for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as hot abscess and similar things; so that you are ready for any occurrence with what is appropriate for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a leg fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that there are two bones in the leg, of which one is large and called by the name Cruris; and the other is subtle, and called Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 It happens to both kinds of fractures that it happens to two bones in the arm: and because of this, restoration is made of it, just as the restoration of an arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones are broken simultaneously, the leg is converted to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if a thin bone is broken, the leg is converted to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if a thick bone is broken, you find it lower: and it is from those which are not hidden to you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equalization, and ligature of the stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the fracture of the leg is a dirty one, having many seths: so that the extension is less, and the alluvialtion is milder on your part.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something more than in the arm concerning the operation: and it is that when you equalize the stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two bands from pine wood, which is used in the making of solar panels placed under tables: and they are made from the blades of the palm: and choose among them those with a slight thickness, and neither be from the very small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over one cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind the two bands in three places at both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For if tightening is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands with a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now let the crib be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is greatly necessary that you do it in a fracture when there is a wound properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the Leg (Crura) on every day, and study with the utmost diligence from purging, or swelling, or other similar conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something happens from among those (conditions), then oppose it with the appropriate means, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 A fracture does not happen entirely in the calcaneum (heel bone).
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Bones of the Foot sometimes suffer a fracture, and even less so do the bones of the fingers: and it does not happen to them unless there is friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture happens in the bones of the Foot and you see those bones elevate over each other, then let the sick person place his foot on the ground prepared as if he is walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand you there, and place your foot upon that which is elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or trample it; and equalize it, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place a plaster, and a woolen cloth on top of it: and put under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with an appropriate fetter when you lower it with linen cloths and other things that are required.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then loosen the binding.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones equalized, whether they are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is therefore as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are fractured, then restore them and equalize them as I told you about the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place your finger at the length of the digit, and let it be slightly wider; then place under the foot this board that I told you, and tie it with a suitable suture.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is broken is from the bones and it is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of suitable size over all the fingers, rolled in linen cloth; and tie the board below the foot; and let it stand above one corner of the board outside the abdomen of the foot to hold with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is suitable for you that you not forget to consider all the things I told you in the other fractures which I mentioned; and apply each one of them as required.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 Chapter on the Fracture of a Woman's Face, and the Bone of the Chest and Man's Vertebra.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's face is fractured, then make her sit square (or upright).
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her towards the back of the same slightly, and let her be held backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then let an obstetrician fill the woman's wound with a linen cloth until it is filled; and let the wound on the face be shaped like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman is shaken (or jarred), and her back is slowly raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that linen cloth will come out until it becomes before the door of the wound like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns (or heals).
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a pledget on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When she wants to menstruate, let her easily remove the linen cloth, then let her menstruate; and return it as much as she first inserted it; then let her return to her pledget (or pad) first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let her do that for seven days or approximately, for the bone itself will be restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an egg, and insert a reed cannula into its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into the sheath of it.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the cannula with force, until the bladder is inflated within the sheath; for otherwise it will burst.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill it with a pad and let it stand for some days as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the man's or woman's jaw is broken, then administer for its healing, and the same remedy that we have mentioned for the bone of Anchus.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And do not hide the rectum in close fractures, which seldom happen, especially for someone who has some knowledge or skill.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book well, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many positions the way of healing and the narrowing for its healing; understand this then.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In the case of a man's rod (penis) when it is broken, take the throat of a goose; and introduce the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place on top of it a covering made from cloth, and wrap it up, and let it stand for three days or about that time; and it will heal if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 Restoration of Bone Fracture When There is an Ulceration.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is suitable for the one who has a fracture with an ulceration, especially if it is large such as the hip bone or the arm, to hasten and call a phlebotomist immediately; if the conditions of bloodletting are confirmed by you as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the ulceration discharges blood, then it is necessary for you to hasten to its amputation so that lime powder is sprinkled over it; if there is nothing else present with you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if an abscess hot, then delay the restoration for the ninth day until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third day and the fourth day completely, for you will make bad things happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 But if the broken bone is prominent under the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and bring it into alignment with your hands easily and with slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 But if there is no extension possible for it and cannot be aligned by your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take three or four according to the amount required for the cure of every type of fracture in any way.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round and have a small thickness so that it does not double up when compressed on top of it during the operation hour; and let it have sharp ends, to which there should be a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the top part of it be as thick as halfway down to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is the form of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that the sharp end of it is bent over the protruding bone extremity; and push it together with it in one motion until when the bone returns and aligns slightly.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore try to align the extremities of the fracture against each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the extremities of the fracture are fine and do not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the bone's extremity until the instrument can hold it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot reduce [the fracture] as we have described, then cut it with what is appropriate for him from the incisions which we mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then file the remainder on the bone from roughness and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 Since the bone is reduced and finds a weak spot after reduction causing strong pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you give great aid to the weak when you complete the restoration that you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse a cloth in mustard water, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And specifically if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place vinegar or anything with oil on the wound; so that it does not cause rot and decay in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer stars (asterisks) at the completion of your bone restoration hour.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And release the discovered wound, so that you cut with forceps the opening in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Take care not to stitch the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For often have foolish physicians done this; and caused death or rot, or gangrene, that is, pus, on their weak patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And your suture should be soft, gentle, and diverse from the remaining fracture sutures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear some of the evils we have mentioned and find pain in the place suspended, then it is not necessary that you place stars over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make swellings from tough cloths in the place of the stars and stitch it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 When however it is past one day or two and you see the wound already starting to produce pus: then remove from above the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Administer linen and unguents as per our custom to heal wounds; such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 It is suitable for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 You should examine the wound every day at morning and evening until it heals and becomes well.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary to prepare the limb so that pus drains from it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If several days pass and the wound does not heal or does not drain pus from it: then you will know that there are fractures of small bones in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should investigate the wound with probing.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of these fractures are separated: remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the limb and cause pain, try to cut them off, and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If an abscess or purulence occurs at the wound, i.e., if it is a boil or any other corruption and putrefaction: then you must apply to each of them what is appropriate for their treatment as described in their respective chapters.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from the conversation in which my speech should remain, and to whom you are to give your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, like the hip bone or shoulder blade or similar large bones: it is not presumptuous to attempt its attraction, for many times death occurs from this. Instead, leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it falls by itself within twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then care for the wound, if it seems to you: and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a swelling in the step of a broken bone.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often occurs this swelling in the step during healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Mainly those near joints: and it becomes foul from that member's shape.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the member from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, consider then if the swelling is recent: administer to it medications that have astringent properties, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, pitch, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, so that you receive some of these or all of them: and prepare them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling on a linen cloth, and tie them firmly with a good suture.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the suture, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it, and put another on until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or tie it firmly over a lead plate.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the swelling has already turned into a stone and is tightened and urgently requires removal: then bind it from above its side, and cut off any excess protruding: or grind it with some scrapers until it is removed: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Chapter on the treatment when the member is restored, but remains delicate afterwards, not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains tender and weak afterwards, it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is an abundance of dissolution of ligament and its binding not as required; or due to excess tightening of ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to excessive embrocation at an incorrect time; or due to scarcity of blood in the body of the weak, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The treatment for it is to feed the weak and make his body tender until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 Administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 Insert joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the limb; so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 Continue embrocation of it with warm water until the nourishment heals and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 Chapter on the healing of fractured bones when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When after the restoration of a limb, twisting or projecting bone of the fracture, or nodulation occurs, and it disfigures the shape of the limb, although the limb does not prevent its natural operation; in such cases one should not listen to the speech of him who believes that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is indeed highly condemnable, leading to death or great fear that it will prove fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 However, if the limp and nodulation are recent; then it should be embrocated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of althea, its root, mellilotus, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let it (be) an ointment like well-prepared diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Take the mucilage of the root of the marshmallow plant, grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply (it) as an ointment.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take the ripe figs and crush them with dove droppings and similar medications that are called those which reduce consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes a knot is loosened by frequent rubbing with an old and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And move the affected limb to all its parts at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If however it has already preceded (the) tortuosity and has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and the necessity of treatment with iron has been provoked: then it is necessary that it be cut above its knot, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what exceeds from the knot or bone be cut with the thin chisels: and ease be given to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it (the member) should not be moved and the figure of the limb becomes deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes the occurrence of additional pain on the weakened part, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore when dislocation occurs, it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if delayed, the location (joint) becomes fixed, and possibly with it the reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore it is not necessary to move or stretch during the time of dislocation setting.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it often causes spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary to hurry to the bloodletting of the weakened.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be allowed to rest until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the limb is to be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced [in size].
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all the limb shall be cured with it, when its recollection comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even as to what preceded it in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower extremity.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the care for dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two Jaws seldom get dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 Dislocation occurs in two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or they are moved slightly from their places and become somewhat softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 The dislocation should be reduced by complete reduction until it softens to the chest part, until the sulcus runs weak and cannot hold it, nor can it close its own mouth, and the tongue of it is wound up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When, however, the dislocation is small, then it returns to many positions by itself with scarcity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and whole, then it must be administered a quick reduction and not delayed too much; and there should be someone to hold the head of the sick person; and the doctor should insert his thumb into the root of the dislocation's mandible bone if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he inserts both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, to hold them equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the sick person to clean his mandibles and to purify them for eating all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor equalizes the mandible and pushes it back until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are together; then administer vaporization with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both of them; do not delay the reduction of both of them at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and are equalized, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they do not soften; then place a pad of linen cloths on them, with a wax made from beeswax; and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then bind it easily with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the sleep of the sick person be on his back; and his head should be stationary between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left; nor should he try to chew something; instead, let his food be soft, until when the pains are removed, and the mandible is loosened; then let him eat whatever he wants, and let that be given to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Do not let him eat or drink at his mouth operation and swallowing, and talking, until the mandible is sutured and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places: then fevers often occur, and there is continuous vomiting; and perhaps the weak stomach dissolves, and perhaps it vomits bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When you see this (scil. the difficulty of reduction): then know that it is a ruin, and he who has this often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocations of the collarbone, and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI (or "Chapter Twenty-Six").
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone is not dislocated from within on the side, due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It is sometimes dislocated towards the outside and this is perceived by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration is that the sick one lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then hollow out a place with your hand, for it will return there.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place on it the plaster and the lint, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, its ends following the elbow should not be dislocated unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it should be reduced and set in accordance with what has been said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place upon it the plaster and lint, and bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And command the sick one to adhere to calmness and stillness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 With this same treatment, the shoulder joint is reduced when it is separated even from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Shoulder Dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of these is that it dislocates towards the touching part below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is that it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it is not dislocated towards the backside, because of the spoon.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front side, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed it is dislocated and goes towards the lower side turned upside down mostly; particularly in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it comes out quickly in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it behaves contrary to that, namely because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some people that there is a blow or an accident and the humerus is dislocated by a dislocation tool when hot, and it is believed because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, it is necessary to test that, until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed with the treatment of it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower side turned upside down; and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you find a clear difference among them, and in the head of the humerus, there is a hollow, and beneath the swollen part of the humerus, it seems as if it is an egg; and the weak person cannot return his hand to its own ear nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards; then you find a clear swelling that is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this type of dislocation has an easy reduction when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is that the tool raises the hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs beneath it and raise the joint with strength towards its place; and the tool raises the hand and stretches it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then place her below, for he quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not return as we have said, and it is from the beginning that dislocation occurs, then the sick person should be bathed in warm water, and embrocation should be administered which softens and soothes, just as if they infuse the roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it should be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick one shall lie down on his back: and let there be placed beneath his chest a sphere and wool, which should be equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor shall place his heel on the sphere, and push the head of the humerus with force, and draw the hand of the sick one towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant shall hold the head of the sick one, so that it is not moved towards the lower part: for he quickly returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, bring him back according to this manner: and it is that you make the man present who is taller than the sick one, and he shall stand on the side, and insert his arm under the chest of the sick one: and push the chest upwards, until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant shall draw the hand of the sick one towards the lower part of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick one is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, to make him heavy; for the dislocation quickly returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is brought back according to another manner: and it is that a piece of wood is shaped on the earth in the form of a round handle, like a glove maker's handle; not too heavy, nor too fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let there be placed beneath the sick one, after the logs have been put on his head; and let the sick one stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then extend his hand towards the lower part and extend his body from the other side with strength: for the union returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If his reduction is difficult through all that has been said, then use this care: and it is to receive a stick whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width four fingers, and its thickness two fingers: which should have a round head, so that it may be softened the entrance into the depth, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then wrap soft cloths around the round head, so as not to injure the weak stick.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it below the weak point, so that the hand or arm may be extended over the stick to the lower part: and tie the stick to the helper and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its width, and extend the hand towards the lower part, and let the remaining body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the union enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When therefore the entrance is completed according to any method possible: then it is necessary, that you place under the weak point a sphere equal in size from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place ready ointment prepared from milled powder with olive oil and egg white on the whole shoulder, as it is rolled over.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a bandage under the weak point of suitable size: and wind the thread over the ointment above: and connect his hand to his neck and let it not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary that food be given sparingly until the member is strengthened: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then it is to be placed again after seven days or five and let it be washed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If therefore it [the wound] is tightened and not softened, then it has already been healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the dislocation [of a fracture] is repeatedly disturbed due to the moisture that happens to it or because of another reason: then it is necessary, that cautionery be applied to it with three holes, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done entirely, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the dislocation is not tightened, and the plaster and the bandage are repeatedly applied and tightened above it but do not hold and cannot raise it upwards: then you know that the nerves that are at the head of the humerus have already been cut or stretched or softened; and you know that a dislocation will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 A dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breastbone or is reduced towards the back is made with pressure and extension using hands; until it returns and further bandaging and care are applied, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness of its motion, then the sick one should bathe himself many times until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to the first nature of his limb.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the healing of elbow dislocations.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You should know that the dislocation of the elbow occurs with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty as well; it is dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or towards the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 Its [the dislocation's] position is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, its position is declared to you clearly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint should be joined and it cannot double the arm nor touch with it its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you rush and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a warm abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a warm abscess occurs to it, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is toward the backside.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 Indeed, every kind of dislocation is worse and more painful; and death often accompanies it many times.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it, when it can be reduced, is to extend the hand with two hands; and the arm should be expanded, and the hands of the physician should be above the elbow and below it, and he himself should push the joint with the fingers of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is toward the frontside: then it returns in such a way that it doubles the hand with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in reduction, then administer a strong and forceful extension; and it is that two assistants extend the arm; and hold him also, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then turn the arm to every side when a cloth doubled long or wide bandage is wrapped around it.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that this is from those which help in lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary to place on it a plaster containing astringency and extract of egg white; and to bind it with a bandage of appropriate size.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 Suspend the arm of the sick person from his neck for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then release (it).
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If it becomes fixed in its place, then loosen the binding from it and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the stitch is not tight enough, then reapply the plaster, the binding, and let it be for some days until it becomes tight.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen (it).
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If, however, it happens that there is pain after the reduction of the stitch and the condition is mobile: then administer humectation in bathing, and fine friction, and compression, until it heals, or place upon the stitch a sheep's wool fat (iliatum), that is, the greasy hide of a ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bind (it) and let it be over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and immerse (him) in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he sweats, then gently friction the stitch.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then place upon it one, two, and three times with an alum application when entering the bath until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it dung of a cow, moist and warm with butter, and bind (it) over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes softened and returns to its normal condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the cure of a dislocation by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Many times Almahassem's hand is dislocated, that is, the stitch between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, the other joints (are more difficult).
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour in which it was dislocated, before the abscess appears there; or an abscess occurs in the same place.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of a dislocation is as follows: Place Mahassem, the weak hand, on the table, and let its attendant extend it; then the physician shall place his palm over the prominent joint, and push until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it must be considered if the palm has already receded towards the wrist of the hand: then let the weak hand lie flat on the table for both extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of its hand should be intrinsically on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should lie on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on top of the prominent joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster sitting on the abscess; and let him be left alone, do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it does not tolerate the reduction, nor can you do it again after the days have passed, but the joint remains in its twisted state; and nothing harms the weak except that it is softened by the hand, and it cannot be bound: then you will know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it, except that it should be tied with a cautery near the break.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not help with anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When Almahassem does not return, then place on him the plaster as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is bound and left for five days; afterwards it is loosened and left, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If it loses motion and something of weight occurs there: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction or to the back of the palm, or the palm's inside: then extend the affected finger, and push the dislocation back using your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the finger's head and turn it towards the direction of the dislocation, and let it remain like that for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it, and extend it until it is equal to its straight state on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, tie it as described, and do not untie it during the day; exercise it with movement, and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it has healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And likewise do the same if a finger is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; tie it to that part and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly do the same when it is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the treatment of spondylolisthesis of the back.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When anyone has a vertebral spine dislocation, either complete of the neck or many vertebrae being removed from their places: then there is no cure in it, because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of it is that the sickness goes out without will, nor can he hold it; and many times some members of his soften from it, or two legs of his, or two arms of himself, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For many times it is removed, for many times it is the removal to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore that which is removed towards the back, is called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure of it is that you consider then, if Gibbositas occurs from childhood; then there is no cure in it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs by accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancient ones have already spoken about the methods of treatment in a long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 It does not return to many when it goes forward.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I have already abbreviated from that one, whose little excuses for many because of my proximity to its intention; and in my exposition, I have shown it, and formed its instrument in a different way than they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore I say that in Gibbositas which occurs from the front part, there is no healing, nor recovery from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in that which happens to two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs in the back properly, as I say; and there is, that the sick one must be spread on his face on an equal plank almost to the wall; and a wet cloth is spread under him so as not to hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight stick fixed in the fire on the ground, at the end of the foot, about its head: and another stick about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let a servant hold the stick, and it not be fastened in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the sick man, and under his chin tie a loose bandage, firm: and extend the end of the bandage to the stick which is at his head: and bind it to that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and at his joints.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bandages together, and bind them to the other stick which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let all the servants extend their bandages to the part of the stick, and let them not be moved from their places where they are fixed: but they should not be fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor shall place his hands on the knee with strength, until it returns: or he shall place a plank over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he ties his feet to the plank until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If it does not return by this treatment, then take a plank whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And hollow out a cavity in the wall which I mentioned next to the sick man, into which the end of the plank shall enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the plank on the knee.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the doctor places his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And bind it tightly, until the knee is straightened and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with a lathe that turns with your hand: and it is so that you mark two sticks on the ground at the head of the sick man at the end of the other foot, whose length is an arm: and at his head at the end of the other foot two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 The length that is between every stick [is] one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the tourniquet runs: and securely fasten all the sticks to the ground very much, so it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 Insert a round stick: and there is a tourniquet in which the ligament is turned in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 At the end of it is a hole, in which the stick is fastened, whose length is one palm and a bit more [than that]: and similarly on two other sticks there are [holes] too.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then bind the ligaments that you bound on the chest of the sick man with the tourniquet that is at his head: and bind the ligaments that you bound on his limbs in the tourniquet that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand at every tourniquet the servant who turns his hand with a cloth, by which the tourniquet is turned: and the doctor ties the Spondilium, as we said before.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 Here is the form of the tourniquet [that follows].
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then after the Spondilium returns and the place is tied, then it is necessary that you put on an ointment of dried figs with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then [apply] wool.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place on top of the ointment a star-shaped figure from a board, whose width is three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such as to cover the area of the swelling and the healthy part of the Spondilium.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament that I mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 The sick man should use a subtle food until he gets well.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains protruding in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that [they administer] medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the board that I mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now, the leaf (or plate) of lead is administered to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And at times, it happens that a prominence occurs on the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is the bone that protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate to make an assumption with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not happen unless there is a dislocation; nor does it happen to them what happens to the other joints from a slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 That is, because it is dislocated to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Indeed, it is mostly dislocated inwardly; and it is less often dislocated to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment for dislocation to the interior is: because when you connect the weak foot with a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of this [dislocated] one protrudes more than that of the healthy one, and the weak one cannot double its foot at the groin; and there is a place following the groin which has been pressed by a hot press, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign for a dislocation to the outside is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms [described previously].
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign for a dislocation to the front is that it expands the healthy foot by its entire length; however, it does not double [the step] without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot do so forward; and urine retention occurs, and the groin area is pressed, and there is striking on the heel during walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign for a dislocation to the back is that it does not expand the knee, nor can it double [the step] before doubling the groin; and the leg is even shorter than the other; and the groin area is softened, and the head of the hip is in its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction [of this dislocation] is as follows: consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already healed with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer a reduction and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not make presumption of it too deeply.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the case where the dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then proceed to this, that you wish to reduce it, and stretch it towards its interior and exterior parts, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and it will not need any other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 But if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant and he should extend the leg from its lower part: either with his hands or with a rope tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand from above so that he introduces his hands under its joints.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then bind it with a soft rope around the root of the hip, and hold the end of another ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let the extension be from its anterior part of the groin to the breast part, or from its posterior part to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 Let the extension of all [bodies] be one until the weak [body] is raised from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this kind of extension is a common type in the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for all that I will say about its cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of it itself when the dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary for the weak to lie on its healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a rope around the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the rope upward from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the breast part.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then let another strong man take hold, and enlarge the large place of the weak hip, and extend it to the outward extension with great force.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it has returned to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this form is easier than the other forms of cure, by which this member is restored.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is excised over you and does not obey you to the entrance with this form of cure at all: then it is necessary, that two weak feet are tied together with a strong ligament, loose, on both heels, and on both knees; and let the length of each be four fingers' width from its root; and let the injured leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then suspend the weak one over the head of the beam that is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two forearms' width.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to brace the head of the hip; and suspend it with another one; and let another youth push, bracing the hip with strength, for the joining returns to its own place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own return, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on the platform, according to what we said in the one with humpback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And let a ligament be bound over his leg, the weak one itself, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two beams are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a beam is placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well; over which are rolled wet cloths so as not to hurt the weak one; and let the beam be between his hips, so that it is not drawn downwards at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let everyone go to their place, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it obeys for returning, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it, as we said in gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Moreover, the weak one should lie on its healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the weak leg be extended quickly; and this is according to the same narrative above on a stool; and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the thigh of the weak one.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend it with the other hand, and with that bending place it extended towards the lower parts at the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary that the weak one be extended towards the lower parts and raised on the ground; instead, it should be placed on a hard surface, as it should also be when dislocation occurs to its outward side, according to what we said about lying down on two surfaces; and it should be in front of its face and the ligaments stretched; according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that compression be administered with a table also on the place from which the dislocation departs, when reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is to extend two legs of the weak one; and when you see that they are equal, and the weak one tightens his leg and stretches it without any hesitation; then you will know that the limb has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the hips, place a plaster, and tie with a bandage, which means a wheel; so that the dislocation does not move towards some part; and let the weak one remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then unloose the ligament and plaster, and connect the leg with the other; then if you see that they are equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is already fixed; therefore release the weak one for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 If you see something softening (rotting): then return and pack it, and bind it according to your first binding method; and leave it even for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then dissolve that (the ointment) and make it delay in walking on both sides for some days, until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Part of a Treatise on Dislocations Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter Thirty-Three.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated outwardly, inwardly, downwards (posteriorly), that is, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated forwardly.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you command the weak person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not adhere with the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 The restoration of all the ways of dislocation is that you make the weak person sit upright, so that he now extends his leg if possible over it, and lets his back rest on your face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and apply them straight across the knee in between the fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply with your palm two sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 Let another servant extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of restoration is that the leg adheres with the thigh gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then pack it (the knee), and make the leg adhere with the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with lint for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then dissolve it (the binding).
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 Let the weak person not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If you are refused reduction (manual repositioning), then administer strong extension with bandages, whose method was previously mentioned in the treatment of ankles, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Treatment for Dislocation of Heel Bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	 In capite de curatione dislocationis calcanei.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 When the heel bone is sometimes moved slightly and other times it is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, advancing towards the part to which it is being dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure for its removal (dislocation) is simple repositioning: and it is that it should be stretched easily with the hands, and made equal until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the cure of it (dislocation) when it dislocates according to its complement, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and let him be held by a strong attendant from behind the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the foot from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the place of the calcaneus.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with your left hand on each side (of the foot).
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand towards the calf without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the front of the foot towards the calf on the third time and you pull the calcaneus.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns to its place once or twice in this manner and you see the foot made equal, that is good: but if not, then repeat the operation on it; because it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If its repositioning is prevented by it as we have said, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a pillow strongly in the ground so that it falls between his hips: and now roll over him a cloth to prevent the sick person from being hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then take hold of his hip by an attendant: afterwards the other attendant should stretch the leg either with hands or with a strap tied around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all attendants should stretch against the counter stretch (of the dislocation): and let a pillow stand between the hips of the sick person holding him so that his body is not drawn towards the lower part during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then, the physician reduces the dislocation with his hands, and the other servant holds the sound leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 The dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and it is shown to you that the healing of it has taken place: then put plaster and wool, and tie it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bond to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or fear of the nerves which are above the heel behind, so that the bandage is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then release him for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage softens, tie it again: then loosen him on the third or fourth day: and prevent the weak from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he tries to walk before that time, there is no security, unless the dislocation is loosened again, and it breaks, and will not accept healing afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer for its soothing that which was previously told in another place about the cure, and the embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocation of the Toes of the Foot, and Cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be reduced with little extension without effort: and this indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is in some knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the weak sits his foot on a level place of the ground, or on a table: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot on that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is reduced, and the projection no longer appears in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his foot a board that can hold the whole foot, which has two holes.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then tighten it with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it, and let him rest from walking for many days until it is tightened and secured against displacement.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something like this occurs, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, death often happens many times over; and therefore, one should not presume to treat it unless he is wise in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor presumptuous; and that he should use only medicines which assuage hot inflammations in the beginning; and let him leave the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for salvation from destruction with mildness of illness, and where there is something that appears promising.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, try the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that assuages the abscess; and care for the wound with it as suits it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with fracture and splinters separate from the bone occur, then try their removal, and do what was said before in simple diseases in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And beware according to your own strength, and guard yourself from entering into the path of fear; as was said before by my preaching to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For it is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more beneficial for your body in your time among them.
