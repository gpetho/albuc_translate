The tenth chapter on the reduction of hip fracture.	CHAPTER TEN. On setting a fractured hip.	0.6859478
Rarely do the hip bones break. If they do break, the break is such that they shatter at their ends, split lengthwise, and tilt inward. The patient experiences pain in the area, a prickling sensation, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.8860082
Its treatment is to run your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is.	0.6369589
If the break is only at the ends, then adjust the fracture according to what you can achieve in setting it until its shape resembles its natural shape.	If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.74818385
If the break is lengthwise, or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can set the fracture. Once you have set it, apply a bandage, then place a splint made of wood or leather on it, and tighten it firmly, without fear of the fracture shifting or the splint slipping.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.90015405
And level the hollow of the flanks with whatever fills it so that the tightening takes hold evenly. And instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.7988373
If a hot swelling appears, stop extending and setting it until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what soothes it, as described previously, then return to setting it and tightening it as appropriate.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.81134564
If fragments appear in the bone, or if anything shatters from its ends, it should not be removed or touched, but rather leveled from the outside, as we have said, and left untightened until it heals.	If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.9187156
