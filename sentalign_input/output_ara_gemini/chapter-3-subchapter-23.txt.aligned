Chapter Twenty-Three on the Discussion of the Jaw	CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE. Discourse on dislocations.	0.6753776
The jaw is a joint's dislocation from its place, thus hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe aches and pains to the patient.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.872963
So when a jaw dislocation occurs to someone, it is necessary to immediately reduce it without any delay, because if it is delayed, the place swells, making it difficult to reduce the jaw.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all. For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.	0.7750985
Therefore, it shouldn't be delayed, moved, or extended while it is swollen because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.	So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.89080495
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately phlebotomize the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then wash the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently and treat each limb with what will be mentioned in its place.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced. And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.76103324
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what was previously mentioned regarding fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.84686977
