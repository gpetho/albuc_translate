On the removal of hairs pricking the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The procedure is this: take a fine needle and insert a fine, smooth silk thread into it.
Then join its ends and knot both very finely: let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then add another fine thread below in Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, near the sunlight to make the operation clear, for it is a delicate or fine procedure.
Then insert the needle with the alinxotati at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert that hair into the alinxotati: if there is one, or two, or three, but not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
If the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the alinxotati downward with the thread you have arranged in it, until the alinxotati exits from the upper opening, and you can see it with your eye: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it will be raised with it: or leave it until it lengthens over time, and then lift it.
