When the eyelid is softened by disease or humidity, cauterize the eyelid with a lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its form:	When an eyelid droops either from disease or humidity, then burn the lid with a single cauterization with this crescent-shaped cautery.	0.77116907
And if you wish, cauterize both eyebrows slightly with two cauteries in all parts, and they should extend from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the eyebrow.	And if you wish burn him also a little above the eyebrows with two cauterizations (; that is, one) on each side; but keep clear of the temples; and let each cauterization be of the length of the eyebrow.	0.8089099
Do not press too hard with the cautery, but just enough so that a third of the eyelid is affected.	Nor let your hand apply the cautery longer than to burn a third of the way through the skin.	0.60775876
