On the treatment of *thelul* (small nasal tumor) in the nose.
Chapter 25.
Often a small tumor (*thelul*) grows at the tip of the nose, enlarges, and increases over time, eventually becoming unsightly.
For this reason, you should cut it as soon as it appears and completely remove it from the root.
Then apply either cautery or a burning medicine to the area to heal it.
If the incision is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, and with little sensation. In this case, do not touch it with iron, as it is a cancerous tumor.
I have often seen cases where one cuts such a cancerous tumor, leading to great harm to the person who has it.
If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that a complete incision is possible, then drain the patient and cut it without fear or worry. Treat the area with drying and astringent remedies until it heals.
