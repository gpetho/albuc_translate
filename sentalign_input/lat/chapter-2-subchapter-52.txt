On the treatment of umbilical protrusion.
Chapter 52
An umbilical protrusion can arise from various causes.
It may be due to fissures in the abdominal membrane, allowing a part of the intestines or abdominal tissue to push out, as can occur in other types of hernias.
Or it may result from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Or it could be caused by trapped gas in that area.
If the cause is a fissure in the membrane with a protruding mass, the abscess’s color resembles that of the surrounding skin. It is soft, painless, and appears in different locations.
If the cause is the protrusion of the intestine, it will display a more pronounced difference, as previously described.
When you press it with your fingers, it recedes but then reappears and might make a sound. It becomes more pronounced in the bath or with intense activity.
If it’s due to excess moisture, it is soft and does not recede or expand when pressed with your hand.
If it’s due to blood, then the abscess appears with dark discoloration in addition to these signs.
If it’s caused by excess tissue growth, then the abscess is serious, thick, hard, and has a consistent size.
If it’s due to gas, it has a soft feel to the touch.
The procedure requires assessing if the umbilical protrusion is due to an arterial or venous blood issue, or to trapped gas; in such cases, you should refrain from attempting treatment.
In such cases, fear and danger are involved, as I explained in the chapter on abscesses related to arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestine or tissue, instruct the patient to hold their breath and stand up straight.
Then mark around the entire umbilicus with ink.
Next, instruct the patient to lie down on their back with you supporting them.
Then use a broad spatula to press around the umbilicus in the area you marked with ink.
Afterward, lift the center of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Then secure it firmly in a circular manner with a strong thread or silk cord, tying a tight knot.
Next, open the extended middle of the abscess above the tied area.
If you find that it is caught by the ligature, remove the knot, insert your index finger, and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If tissue is present, grasp it with a hook and cut off any excess.
If you encounter an artery or vein, work carefully around it.
Then continue with your procedure.
Take two needles threaded with strong thread, and insert them around the abscess in a cross pattern, making sure they penetrate.
Then, tighten the abscess in four places over the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave it until the stretched tissue rots and falls off naturally, or cut it off once it becomes thin and decomposed.
Then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to excess tissue or moisture, then hollow out the abscess as we have described.
And remove any blood or moisture that you find inside.
Then treat it with something that will harden and stabilize the area.
