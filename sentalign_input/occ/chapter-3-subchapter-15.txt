Chapter 15:
On the restoration of fractures of the kneecap.
Know that fractures of the kneecap are rare but often suffer wear and tear.
If a fracture occurs, it is usually a crack or break in its parts, either with or without a wound, identified by symptoms.
Restoration involves aligning the broken parts with the fingers until they are joined as much as possible with proper adjustment and ease.
Apply a plaster and a round splint if needed, and secure it with an appropriate bandage.
Consider all the conditions described for other fractures, such as severe abscesses, and address any complications appropriately until healed.
