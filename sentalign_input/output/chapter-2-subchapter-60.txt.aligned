of the stone	On the extraction of the stone.	0.44146636
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one must operate with cutting; in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will explain it clearly and briefly.	We have already in the due place reviewed the different kinds of stone and the medical treatment of them. I mentioned too the difference between stones arising in the kidney and those arising in the bladder, and gave all the symptoms of them. I also mentioned the kind of stone to which manipulation and incision are appropriate.	0.8421013
I say that stones formed in the bladder occur more often in children, and it is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety; and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it often hangs, and then stiffens; and many of these stones pass through the urethra; and the treatment is easier for children until they are four years old, and it is very serious in the elderly, and moderate in the young, for those who are between youth and old age; and the treatment is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.	Now I say that a vesical calculus most frequently occurs in boys. Among the symptoms is that the urine passed out of the bladder is of a thin consistency like water, and sand appears in it; and the patient keeps on rubbing and playing with his penis; and often it hangs flaccid and then is erected; at the same time many of them get a prolapse of the rectum. The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two. And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise.	0.8844347
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. Because it sometimes obstructs the search for the stone.	When we undertake treatment the patient must first have an enema to empty his bowel completely; for sometimes the faeces prevent the calculus being found when it is looked for.	0.7432797
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him below, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes it jumps from the high place; then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards; then search for and touch the stone inside;	Then the patient should be taken by the feet and jarred to and fro and shaken downwards to bring the calculus down into the neck of the bladder; or else let him jump down from a height a number of times. Then have him sit down upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs, to make the whole bladder incline downwards. Then examine him and palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it.	0.8554701
if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately hasten to cut over the stone. And if it does not fall completely to the touch, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then move it to the neck of the bladder; then press down with your finger, and push it to the place where you want to cut.	If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it. But if there is not the slightest sign of it to the touch then you should anoint with oil the forefinger of your left hand if it be a boy, or the middle finger if it be a fully grown young man, and introduce it into the anus and search around for the calculus, until, when it comes under the finger, you can work it slowly towards the neck of the bladder. Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision.	0.9099222
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the cut is made; then insert the cutting spatula, which has this form:	Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision. And bid an assistant squeeze the bladder with his hand; and bid another assistant raise the scrotum with his left hand and with the other hand stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision is going to be.	0.77522826
And cut between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock; and be straight over the stone, and your fingers should always be in the anus, and the cut should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;	Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards. The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger.	0.8195735
perhaps pressing it with the finger that is in the anus, so it comes out without effort; and know that there are some stones with angles and edges: they are difficult to extract; and there are some that are smooth, like an acorn, and round, whose exit is easy.	Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty. You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult. Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily.	0.884457
For those with angles and edges, make the cut larger; and if it does not come out, then it is necessary to grasp it with forceps that are like a file at the tip, to hold the stone so it does not slip; or you insert underneath it a fine instrument curved at the tip; and if you cannot manipulate it this way, then enlarge the opening a bit, and if the blood flows, then stop it with vitriol;	But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision. Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a deviceâ€” namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end. And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol.	0.8681845
and if there is more than one stone, then first push the largest to the neck of the bladder, then cut over it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterward if there are several. And if it is very large, then it must be sawed, and the wound made larger. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through where the place cannot heal; but always strive to pull it out, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;	If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two. But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all. Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes; or else attempt to break it up with the forceps so that you can extract it piecemeal.	0.8913889
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and compress it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then wrap the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.	And when you have completed the operation pack the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it up and apply a pad soaked in olive oil and wine or oil of roses and cold water, to reduce the swelling. The patient should lie flat on his back and the bindings should not be undone before the third day; and when they are undone foment the place with plenty of oil and water.	0.921731
And when you untie it, then moisten the place well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.	Then dress it with Palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.	0.61840975
And if hot abscesses form in the wound and corrosions, and clots of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way that blood flows with the urine: then insert your finger into the wound, and remove that blood, because if it remains, it corrodes the bladder, and rots it;	If an increasing and cankerous abscess occur in the wound, or anything similar such as clotting of blood within the bladder, with stoppage of the urine (which would be signified by the urine being accompanied by blood) pass your finger into the wound and remove the blood; for if it lies in it it will lead to sepsis and necrosis of the bladder.	0.73355764
then wash the wound with water and hyssop and salt, and help it in all the ways you know, until it is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you tie his thighs together, and apply the medicines to the place.	Then wash out the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply whatever treatment is suitable for the case until it heals. Also at all times during treatment his hips should be bound and kept together so that the medicaments applied to the place may not be disturbed.	0.8341941
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot flow out; then treat it with what I mentioned before, that you often cut it, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this method.	Now if the calculus be small and be impacted in the opening of the urinary passage, preventing the exit of the urine, treat it with the means I am about to describe before you go on to make your incision, for often I have found this treatment suffice without incision; I have experience of this.	0.79893947
Take an iron drill according to this shape and it should have three angles fixed in a stick:	You take a drill of the finest steel, of this shape. It should be triangular at the point and sharp, with a wooden handle.	0.6448351
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then insert the drill into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; then the urine will soon flow, then press your hand on what remains of the stone inside the penis. It will soon break, and come out with the urine, and the patient is healed;	Then take a thread and with it bind the penis beneath the calculus to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder. Then introduce the iron of the drill gently into the meatus until the drill reaches the stone itself, and then very very gently revolve the drill upon the stone with your hand, and try to perforate it, till you pierce it through to the other side. Then the urine will at once be released. Then, with your hand outside the penis, squeeze the remains of the stone, and they will crumble and be washed out by the urine and the patient will be cured.	0.9262742
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it, then cut the penis at the stone between the two ties, then remove it, and untie the thread, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.	But if this treatment is not possible for you on account of some impediment, then tie a thread beneath the stone and another above; then make an incision down upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, extract it, then undo the ligature and clean away the blood that has clotted in the wound.	0.9045528
