of wounds/about wounds
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds; now we will tell you the treatments of hands and of medicine, according to completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the cut of a sword and knife, or of a spear or wood or arrow, or similar things; or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members; and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will begin with simple head wounds, for the remaining will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head, and the bone is not broken, take note if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the development of a hot abscess: then immediately have him bleed from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part; and the patient should avoid repletion from wine and rich foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, then let his food be light, and he should not drink wine, nor eat meat; and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops there, cotton moistened only in rose oil, or in astringent wine; and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not altered by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later; and if the air has altered it, then put on some ointments, until it is healed. 
And if the wound is large, such as from a cut of a sword or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, then bring them together by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, concerning stitching.
If the wound is uncovered to the bone, and hangs, and only holds on by a little, then cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat rich foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also like chicken, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it; and if there is an artery in the wound or a vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it displaced, then tie it with a thread; and if that is not helpful, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that is that you put in this powder which heals before the air alters it.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part incense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, so that it dries well and joins with all its blood; and then tie it well, and leave it without untying, unless it swells; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the air has not altered the wound.
And if the air has altered the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder on it; but applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it discharges pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed. 
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers; and I will tell you later about fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other solution than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything restrictive, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member; but let the medicine be soft, such as warm water washes, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked leeks also washed in fresh water, and other ground-up stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and hairy and full of mud, then pierce it in the lowest place; and if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, then uncover it, and wash it, and cauterize it if necessary; and if the cartilage of the throat is cut, or the gullet, and the passage is preserved, through which the food goes, then sew the gullet over the cartilage of the throat, and do not touch the throat but restore it according to its natural shape; and then bind it properly, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed; and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then clean it; and if there are pieces of bone, then pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound rots, and is separated and the opening cleared; and if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned.
And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter. 
of the wound from a lance or knife
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then see if wind comes out of the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal; and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder in it at the first hour, and do not bind it because of the blood so that it does not remain deep inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put in an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day; and if you do not have ointment, then put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so no spasm will come, nor bad heart tremors or shortness of breath; and when you see the good signs, then know that the wound is safe.
Then treat it with tents and other treatments, until it is healed; and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know that there is a fistula; so treat it as one should.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, whether in the chest or the back, treat it as described before; if it is large, with stitching; and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and has cut pieces, then search the wound, and draw them out if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, then the extraction will be easier; and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
