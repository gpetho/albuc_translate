Chapter Twenty-Two:
On the Cauterization of Extrophulos.
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, and you want to digest them quickly, heat the concave cautery, which should have two open ends for smoke to escape. Apply the heated cautery to the abscess once, or as needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt tissue is removed.
Then treat it with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it heals.
The form of the cannula or cautery for this purpose is appropriate.
