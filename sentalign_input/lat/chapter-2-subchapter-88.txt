On the treatment of sinuses, and the nature of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the abscess extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what is inside it comes out as pus, and a hollow space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has already been thinned, and it does not reach the deepest corruption, nor does it press on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus and is not called a fistula: however, if its space extends until the corruption reaches one of these parts, then it is called a fistula or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut all that skin as it is unfolded, especially when it has thinned and become like a cloth: and you are assured that it is not adhering to the place due to its corruption.
If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and it does not result in that final corruption in consequence, and if there is thickness from flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster, and consider the sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus discharged from it has a foul odor, then cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, placed in a vessel, and boiled over fire until the medicine becomes red and thickens like honey.
Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it; tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is cleansed with ash water when this medicine is not available; take ash from vine wood or holm oak wood, and throw it over the water.
Then strain it, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the sinus is now washed.
If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey mixed with some crushed ziniar.
Or cleanse it with honey and wine mixed together, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps the sinus adhere, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption in the sinus is now removed, then cleanse it with something that promotes flesh growth in it.
This means you should take dyafinicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments, the properties of which I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow and does not admit the clyster tube, then enlarge it slightly with an iron tool; or place a linen strip soaked in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment in it, until it expands.
Similarly, if the opening is too wide, then draw its lips together with a suture, and leave enough space for the clyster to enter without any further addition.
Likewise, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above, then cut it at a lower point so that the pus flows downward, since pus, when confined in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from growing in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus lower as you desire, then attempt to prepare the limb in a way that allows pus to flow from it easily according to your preparation.
Ensure that no pus at all is retained in it; and take healing medicines that are applied over the wound, appropriate for what you intend.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the entire sinus.
Then cut a hole with scissors directly at the opening of the sinus, slightly larger than the sinus opening.
Then spread mild ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the area, keeping it slightly away from the sinus opening, to ease the exit of pus from it; and do not remove the large cloth except once after a few days.
But the one that is on the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, to allow the pus that accumulates in it to flow out; and so you may know whether the discharge is copious or scant, digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it or not.
Therefore, when your treatment progresses in this manner, and you see material emerging from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is already adhering or is close to adherence; then, release it in the morning or on the third day, and when you uncover the wound, replace the cloth and renew the ointment.
However, if thin discharge comes out from the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since among people, there are those who are slow in generating flesh in their wounds, and others who act contrary to this.
But if undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
Therefore, if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter is prolonged, then increase the drying quality of the medicines; let physicians make the medicines moist in substance but dry in their effect, like dyafinicon ointment, when an excess of zegi is added to it.
And among the more final treatments, take dyafinicon ointment, dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine in equal measure.
Then prepare it with this and use it.
And similar to this procedure, when dyafinicon ointment is not available, is honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind it all, and sprinkle it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread it on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; also spread it with the honey you boiled until thickened, sprinkle spices over it, place it on a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of heavenly lily, which is a lily, and herb flour, and centaury are applied to it.
Use them simply or combined, grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them over the honey as I mentioned, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged and it is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption in its depth, or it is already affecting the bones, or the other hard parts, or ligaments; then treat it with the cure for fistulas, as previously mentioned.
