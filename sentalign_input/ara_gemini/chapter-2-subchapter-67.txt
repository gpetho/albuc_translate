Chapter sixty-seven on the hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells, and nothing of the intestine descends to the testicles.
And if it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum.
This occurs from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said, and that is that the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes.
And its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
It may also be treated with iron in this manner: The patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the place of the swollen hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you pad the peritoneal layers that are under the skin until the white peritoneum that follows it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding places on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and stick one to the other with the stitching.
Then you pull the edge of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds. So when the threads are cut, you clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
