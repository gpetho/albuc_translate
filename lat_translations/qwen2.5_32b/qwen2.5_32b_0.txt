Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Now that I have completed this book for you, my sons, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end in it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of practice, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the practice with the hand has fallen in our region and in our time entirely neglected: until perhaps its knowledge perished, and its trace was cut off: and nothing remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were altered by hands: and they fell into error and hesitation, until its intentions were closed, and its power was lost: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the order of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and to come with the forms of the instruments of cautery and other surgical instruments: which is achieved by the addition of declarations, and by the necessity of its progress.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the benefits of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their emergence, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the exits of those places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, Hippocrates said that the name is abundant with the name, but scarce with the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed already spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy will not be cleansed but will fall into error by which men are killed: as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I saw a foolish doctor incise a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in the neck: hence the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead under his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore proceeded to do so and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had indeed been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving payment from one of the Dukes in our land for medical services: and it happened that a black eunuch who was with him had a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor, in his ignorance, hurriedly bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to drain.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he treated him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and he remained thus until his leg swelled with an abscess, and his foot reached destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called therefore to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and peace followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the member until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who punctured the cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after days, until its wickedness was magnified with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which means that when the cancer is purely from a melancholic humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate being totally amputated.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the practice with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, an operation associated with safety, and an operation with which there is danger in most conditions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already warned in every part of this book where the operation brings fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious about it and avoid it, so that fools do not find a way to speak and disparage it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Take therefore measurements with care and protection, and tend to your patients with ease and firmness, and make use of the better way leading through God's grace to salvation and a praiseworthy continuation: and leave behind terrible illnesses difficult to heal: and free yourselves from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally for your dignities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat illness badly: lest you be called bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Regarding the Hot Cauterization and Sharp Medicinal Cauterization, categorized and ordered from head to foot, with forms of instruments and cauterization tools: and everything necessary for the procedure.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Regarding cutting and piercing, bloodletting and venting, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar objects: all categorized and ordered with forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Regarding restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twisting and similar conditions: categorized and ordered from head to foot, with forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Regarding the Benefit and Harm of Cauterization: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the procedure with it, I must say about the benefits and harms of it: and in what complexion it is administered.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of the cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science and an hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also, many wise people have spoken about it and disagreed on it: and for me, a little of their discourse is sufficient, fearing lengthiness.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that the cautery is beneficial universally to all complexions, which are with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that the cautery is not suitable for the disease which arises from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat: and it is inappropriate to be healed from a hot and dry ailment with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite said that through the cautery there is benefit in every hot and dry disease which occurs in human bodies: for when you compare the body of a man and its moistures to the temperament of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed I say through his words: because from experience it has already revealed that to me on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it should not come to that unless one who has already been tested and trained in the chapter on the last exercise of cauterization, and knows the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexions there is no fear for you: especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors have now agreed on them: and they have not disagreed about treating them with cauterization.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing with cauterization by fire, and its goodness over cauterization with burning medicine is this: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm another connected part except with slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine reaches to that which extends from the members: and it may cause a disease difficult to heal in the member, and it may even kill.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause that, unless there is an excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now this has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing on the truth of things: and because of this, I am excused for the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not permitted to this my book, I would bring you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies expelled by itself, by which it expels diseases demonstrated philosophically, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, O sons, that they disagree on the time when it is appropriate to perform cauterization, and they place the better time in spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times: because the harm caused by the time is overshadowed by the benefit that is brought with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is for pains caused by necessary, strong, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay: because it is feared that a greater harm may occur, which enters due to the time, than a small harm.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let this fall into your minds, O sons, which is not feared except by the common people and foolish doctors, namely that there is no recurrence of that disease which is cured by cauterization: and they place this consequence, and things are not as they think: because cauterization is only in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization exceeds medicine by the speed of its healing and the power of its operation and the strength of its dominion: and it is possible for the disease to return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his disease, and its power: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of excesses in him: and what comes to him in his acquisition from foods and similar things from those causes, unless the disease is one for which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in the limb of few excesses and moistures, like a tooth cauterization, because of pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that the pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common saying again, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a correct statement: not in what they intend by it themselves: for they believe that there is no cure which compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the failure of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is contrary to that, and the intention, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is not what it seems: for when we administer modes of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help, then we apply cauterization at the end, and it does help: thus it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they said this only because of the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance: and they said that the site of the cauterization does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that it does not do that in some bodies without other factors.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with it is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cauterization with gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold: and when it quickly cools down, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into employment: and because of this, the cauterization is done more quickly and closer with iron among us, from straightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed I have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterization according to the chapters: and I have ordered them from head to foot: so that it may help the seeker find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applied to the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of phlegm, and the abundance of fluids flowing from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and generally all illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, phlegm, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to instruct the patient to purge with a cleansing and dissolving medicine for three nights or four, according to the requirement of the patient's strength, age, and habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a novacula.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then cauterize with olive oil; this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with ink, by the descent whereby your hand is gradually tightened, and you will rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly remove your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the amount of the head of alkil or the amount of zehurub is now exposed from the bone, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, apply your hand with the same iron, or with another one if it cools down: until the bones appear, which I have told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on it a cloth soaked in butter, and leave it on the spot until the burn scab is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment tetrapharmacon until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the longer the wound remains open, it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the density of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is scraped after that which was burned from the bone, then it should be treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to use the cautery until it makes a strong impression on the bone so that the bone falls off, which becomes like the shape of a knife: or an instrument which women place with a small amount of ink: and they estimate that vapors of the head are exhaled from this location, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it becomes solidified.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two types of cautery do not seem to apply to everyone but only to certain individuals according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for its safety.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of the sick person is weak by nature: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it: therefore act with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the head for pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head and persists in the patient, they use herbs, cochiis, head purges, oils, and emplasteries.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we mentioned and it does not help at all: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the patient is strong in its natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little under it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the entire horn of his head with a cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and uncover from the bone the amount we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place which is called the vase: and it is the place where the cupping vessel is placed: and raise your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient finds because of that a very severe pain, and different from the pain of all the other head cauterizations.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this is the Cautery in its place: and it must be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of it more subtly than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is cleansed with purifying medicines for the head, and the rest of the treatment which I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is administered, and if it does not improve: then cauterization on it is according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with sharp and burning medicine is to take one garlic clove, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the painful area with a wide lancet until you make a place under the skin where the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Introduce it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a poultice of proper constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; then release it, and remove the garlic, and let the wound be for two or three days; afterwards apply to it a cloth soaked in butter until pus forms at the site; then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with an iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A cautery with fire, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clauilis: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the area and hold your hand steady: and you should rotate the iron gradually with speed: and the amount that is burned should be according to the thickness of the skin, like its midpoint.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the bandage in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days: then apply the bandage with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half of the head with the second knife tip of the Cauterizer.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this half of the head, not properly the old one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in the old half of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat half of the head, using what we have said from the previous treatment and what we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the knife cauterizer until it whitens after you mark the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or something like that: and remove your hand once, and hold it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must be careful not to cauterize the moving jaw used in chewing, so that the side or the nerve which moves it is not burned, causing spasms.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and beware of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in cutting it there is fear, especially for one who does not know what he is doing, and who is not skilled or experienced: and he leaves the operation at the very beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the treatment of blood flow occurring from an artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cautery is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Regarding the method of cauterization for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with solutions and other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then apply cautery with fire: and it is that which is called Punctum, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make punctures with it after igniting it around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And keep the cautery away from the root of the ear for a moment after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points on the entire ear, and about that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Regarding the method of cauterization for torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is treated with cauterization is only of the kinds that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization for the kind that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this kind of torture with plasters, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is to cauterize directly at the upper end of the ear under the horn of the head a little, and another at the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until the amount equal to the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, whose shape is as mentioned before; however, it is not as fine as you see: and it must be a knife with a slightly excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the areas with what precedes: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cauterization on the back of the head, according to what has preceded: and the method of the cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is the last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it should be treated with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterizing in forgetfulness.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the patient's head entirely, and place on the back of his head a plaster of mustard as described in the chapter on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is indeed the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cauterization, with what precedes it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish for an addition, and the patient is tolerant of it: then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish for an addition: then cauterize it over the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for it until it heals: let the cauterization be oiled according to the form which was mentioned.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the patient: afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on every horn of the head, and with a cautery on the back of it, and with three on the cervical vertebrae.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you need in the illness a softening of the body more than those, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until it is burned deeply from the skin as much as possible, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and thus oil the cautery.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, you should first cleanse his brain with hellebore and with the other treatments we have mentioned in the division: when the patient is severe, or tolerant in receiving medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, after improving the food over many days.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries we mentioned for those having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess inclined towards melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him in drink that which will cleanse his brain, according to what has been mentioned in the division: then shave the head of the patient, and make afterwards a properly made tortella from linen, like a circle.

Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over both temples with two cautery points, if the onset of water descent occurs in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the onset of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cautery be long in width across the temples: and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and beware of blood flow.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in ancient tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient and persistent: and they are above the veins and arteries which are on the external surface of the head, it is verified that this is due to cold, phlegmatic excesses: then cauterize with the same cautery as I described in the onset of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over both temples, and two cauteries on the neck below two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if additional treatment is needed, then cauterize it on all sides of the eye carefully, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

And if you wish, cauterize it slightly above the eyebrows with two cauteries on each side: and they should be placed away from the temples: and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn and pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization is done in two ways: either with fire; or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who clean them, until they grow out and are even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they prick him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move, until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they grow out and are even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark above the eyelids of his eyes with a stencil, in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the cautery imbued in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then heat the cautery, which is of this form.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure you marked gradually in many places until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is properly burned entirely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the healing of your work is: if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Raise then your hand then: and leave him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place the cautery with butter on it until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then apply the cautery again to that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If the hairs are on the lower [lid]: then cauterize it until it rises to its natural position: and equalize so that the hairs do not poke the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is that you should instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they lengthen and even out.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from cloth paper.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unslaked lime one ounce each; then grind them together well, and make it quickly so that it does not cool.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread it over the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white: and let the patient's head be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine and press it for a moment.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the patient feels the bite of the medicine: for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	Therefore, while this bite which he discovered persists, then discontinue the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	Therefore, when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises with contraction by fire or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat on it from the medicine on the spot where the medicine does not leave a mark and does not darken, until your operation equals and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place Cow-dung with butter on it until the burned skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a diaphoretic ointment, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard with utmost caution that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after some days, and something struggles out from hairs in the eye, then repeat the medicine on the spot that softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should know that the eyes of humans differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, let your consideration be according to this: and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing in lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, with what we have said about the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then, you must cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cloth soaked in egg white or in psilios mucilage over his eye: then cauterize with fire, the form of which is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's feather quill from one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you want it to penetrate to the other end, and if you want it to go upwards, try it thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cauterization tool, which is made very hot, on it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand near the cauterization tool by the eye, towards the nasal side, so that your hand does not waver or disturb the patient: and place the cauterization tool on the eye fat, and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach with the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then apply the cautery once, or twice, if you need that: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a poultice with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days have passed and it has not healed: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine over it until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to how it comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of the cautery for fistulas, which some first mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the location of the fistula and find it: then place a fine camahan into the fissure, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with a good retention of the cannula, and do not move the patient at all, so that the molten lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary to place on the patient's eye a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage and redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to how it will come to its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Fissures often occur on the Lip, which are called Chaps, and especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, then make a small knife-shaped cautery with fire according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it ignited quickly on the fissures until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with cerote until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of cauterizing in oral fistulas.
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula is formed: then you treat it, and if the treatment does not help, then you must heat a cautery according to its size so that it fits into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert it heated into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterward with what we have said about the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is removed and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come upon its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing in gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum is softened due to moisture and the teeth are loosened, and you treat it with medicines and it does not improve: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then with a fire cauterize it, whose form will come after this, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and insert into it a ignited cauterium quickly: and hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand: then repeat the cauterization several times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour: and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth is secured, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the pain of the tooth is due to cold, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cauterization is applied in two ways: either cauterization with butter: or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery of it with butter is to take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take the cloth and wrap it over the end of the bandage.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in boiled butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the heat penetrates to the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool or cloth in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery of it with fire is to use a brass tube or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something thick on the body of it so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then with fire cauterize it, whose form will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary after applying that cautery that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever end you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the tube.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterizing in strophulus.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophulas are caused by phlegm and cold humidities, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then use a concave cautery, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at one end: and place it ignited upon the aposteme once, and a second time if needed, until it reaches the depth of the aposteme.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the aposteme is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the aposteme.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the cane-shaped form heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidities overcome the lung channel, and especially when it is with a cold disposition, then it is necessary that the patient be first evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at the nockeri near the root of the throat in a depressed area: and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor on the skin, except slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery near the joint of the neck at its last vertebra ultimately: and let the cautery be according to the manner which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what has precedeed until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lungs, and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and disease of the lungs are from cold humidities, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is chronic: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, mild, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form which preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be done by pricking with a cautery which is called Point, whose form preceded in the pricking of ear pain: and let the pricks be from thirty points up to about another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what has precedeed until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, it is alleviated with that cauterization when you do three cauteries with it once.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing in titillatio, in the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the helper is dislocated due to moisture and does not return to its place at the time of its usual return from dislocation until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it dislocates from a small movement, which occurs as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should lie on their back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin that is inside the Titillici upward with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint dislocates inward.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cautery with two prongs heated by fire.
Cuius forma est haec.	Its form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cautery marks.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, hence the figure of the cauterization then has six marks: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the wire.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this manner, hence there are eight cautery marks.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place ground onions with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient adhere to tranquility, so that the limb is not moved for some time until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upward, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a key cautery or by puncturing with many cauters.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and excessive moistures occur in the stomach, causing it to deviate from its natural disposition, and phlegm increases around it, and usual methods of treatment are not beneficial: then the sick person should lie on their back and extend their legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauters, a spoon-shaped cautery of the size of one finger and a key cautery, and two cauters below from both sides of the single cautery, until the shape of the cauters forms a triangle.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And space them apart so they do not join, when they would form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And the shape of the cauters should be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery which is used for this cautery be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking one who fears this cautery: and it is to mark a point on the stomach according to the size you wish with encaustic; then cauterize it with a puncture cautery; then treat it with the preceding treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the method of cauterizing the cold spleen.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the spleen due to cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by expelling excesses, and the patient is treated with what we have said but does not improve: then the patient must lie on their back, and mark out three cautery points with encaustic according to this figure and in the same quantity below the spleen near the hypochondria, where a person's elbow reaches. And let there be space between each cautery equal to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body, and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity burned be according to the thickness of the skin, a quantity not exceeding half of it: and let the patient stand on their feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If, however, he cannot stand, then let him lie down, with his legs extended and arms raised.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you to cauterize these points with a knife cautery when you have finesse and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware that you do not proceed too deeply in cauterization, so that the thickness of the entire skin is burned, causing the whole body to be burned and reaching the intestines: for the skin there is thin, so be aware of this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that a swelling appears and you want to know if this pus formation is in the substance of the liver or in its covering: then if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient suffers from pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the covering of the liver, there is intense sharp pain with it; and you see now that its treatment has tired out its doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient should lie down on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the place of the pus formation with cautery: then heat the cautery which resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it once, until the skin is entirely burned and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment for burnings, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one should not use this type of cautery unless their study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands such illnesses occur repeatedly with experience: then indeed they may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, use a cautery with roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in the following manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you take from the dried long roots of aristolochia one longer root, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and ignite it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery where the fork joins the neck, and with two small cauteries under the slightly inclined glands on the side that is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also where the fifth and sixth ribs incline towards the back slightly: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one where the two spatulas meet: and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between the two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not compress your hand with the cautery, but let the skin be clearly smelled.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are those who use a cautery similar to a rod: they heat it and insert it between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and the pus comes out: as we have said regarding the abscess of the spleen.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery, there is a fear that either the patient dies immediately, or an ulcer forms at the site, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Regarding the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat spleen disease, with what we have said about treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery is applied in three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three cauters, or four by lining according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver's cauterization, whose figure preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cauterium the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cauterium, which we have mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to ignite a cautery having two prongs, which we have mentioned in the chapter on the dislocation of the shoulder: and elevate the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient reaches: and let your elevation be such that you raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two prongs that are very hot until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you leave it to emit pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all that have preceded in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Regarding the method of cauterization in hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cautery does not apply in hydrops, unless properly positioned.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat the water swelling with the methods of cure that we have mentioned in the division, and if the treatment does not help, then you must cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization on the stomach, and another cauterization on the spleen, and a cauterization on the liver, and two cauterizations behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in line with the chest, and another in line with the stomach: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open so that it may discharge pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after cautery with it: which requires that two intentions be combined: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be key-shaped: according to its previous form: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped: according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses form in hydrops and are filled with yellow water: you must cauterize on the back of the foot at the nockerati, which is between the auricularis and anularis: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For yellow water will exude, and the cautery should be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery: and let a cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another below it, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and leave the open cautery without treatment for a long time: so that some water may sweat out of it: then treat it with the other things we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterization for abdominal treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the abdominal ailment arises from cold and humidity, weakening the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of healing but does not heal: and you see the patient tolerating the cautery of abundant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what precedes in the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle claw-shaped cautery: and a large cautery on the alcatin above the alhosos, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive humidity and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the comb area, and a cautery on all the ilium: and perhaps add two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is an effective treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they arise from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moistures, and are treated with what we have said in the section on treatment, but if the cure does not help: then cauterize with three cautery points above the lower spine under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and beneath the navel with a cautery almost two digits away.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is overly cooled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen with pus, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen with a key-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off althelul, then heat the cautery which resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the heated cautery into the cut althelul: and hold it with your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what helps heal them from ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the alcatin, it is less effective in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the cutting and procedure which we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore an anal fistula occurs in someone and becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore more appropriate to probe it with a fine探针. 
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite the cautery, which is like a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the fistula itself and the amount in which the nail entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the amount of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if it is there, or large veins: or if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestine, then guard yourself from all these areas.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the area until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If the area is sealed and materials are removed from it and remains so for a long time: then you know that it is now fully healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials do not separate from it, then you know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted hole in its depth, or something like that, of which the recollection will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or severe flatulence, and it is reduced because of the illness of the infirm, then it is necessary to cauterize it over almethen on the kidneys, with a nail-shaped cautery over the entire kidney, as previously mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almidah.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lined [things] will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be more final in healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter Forty.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debility and softening due to cold and moisture occur in the bladder, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the sumen above the bladder, where the hairs of the comb begin, and with one cautery on the right side of the sumen, and another on its left: and let the length of that lateral cautery be according to the size of the thumb knot: and cauterize it with the lower back cautery, or two cauters if necessary for that: and let it follow the previous cautery at the clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter Forty-One.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, preventing conception and corrupting its menses, and delaying their onset, and pain occurs at their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauters around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with one cautery below the scapula on the back, or with two cauters: and let the cautery be at the clavicle.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humidities are poured out to the hip socket of Anchae, and become the cause of its departure from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when they are placed side by side: and the site of dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, you must cauterize the affected area over the hip socket of Anchae with a similar circular cautery: after you mark it with encaustic around the circumference of the socket, as it turns: and let the socket itself fall in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the same form that was used previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large oil cautery: and the depth of the cautery should be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip socket and its cause is cold and humidities: and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment does not help and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to relieve the patient of thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery for this is according to two methods: either a cautery with burning medicines, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize above the lid of its container with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And give them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the lid of its container.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore, there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the lid, with one: so that the circle contains the entire lid.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain is attached to the lid itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, on the spot where the patient indicates there is pain, and with your cautery on the thigh four fingers towards the woodland side: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it where they indicate with a pinpoint cautery, three, four, or more if it is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize that place with one surgical cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations so that you do not go too far with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve or a large artery, and thereby bring about a very harmful damage or contraction on the patient.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one or another of those who cauterized above the ankle and went too far in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until a tumor followed to the foot, and it was completely perforated and the entire foot corrupted; then peritonitis occurred, and death followed that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said about the cauterization of an anchor, for which this is the method of cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar instrument from iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a kernel of a finger, or slightly less: and within that instrument be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each instrument be the width of a thumb joint: and let the instruments be open on both sides: and let their depth be about one or two thumb joints: and make them handles of iron suitably fitted to the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and throws out sparks: then it is placed on the anchor's ulcer of the patient lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauteries in one turn.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, we have used this type of cautery little, O sons, because of the terror of its appearance: and moreover, because we find few who can endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is among the good cauteries for one who endures and finds its proper place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery with burning medicines is such that you make two jars having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its lid made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: each should have two knobs, or something like them, in height.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space between the two be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them be able to clamp together according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on the lid of the anchor, with the patient lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the lid of the anchor.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles with hot water, which has been heated briefly with fire, and keep it for the duration of an hour: and let the patient tolerate its bite and its burning, for he will find the bite like fire, until the bite subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and clean the entire area around the wound with warm water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg: make a poultice on what contains water, according to how you did on the wound equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unquenched lime, each one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has one small hole through which a finger can pass: and place another glass pot under the bottom of the pot: then pour sweet water over the alkali and lime to submerge both by a finger's depth: after which you should press them with your hand firmly: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over another lime: and distill until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong in sharpness, which is used in many medical procedures and in the cauterization of other parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it causes its own burning action.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the medicines are those with which the ankh is cauterized, such as tesiie, and mango paste, and lime with soap, so that each is thoroughly mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported the treatment of an ancient man who was cured of the pain of the ankh and the sciatic vein: and he praised it greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that no other treatment was needed, and that he was cured in one attempt, until he reported that he perhaps entered a bath carried in and exited it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take the dry, fresh: and grind it much with some fat, and place it on the ankh where there is pain, or on the leg, or on the hip: and bind it, and leave it for a duration of three hours, or to the extent that the patient feels the sedation of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, put him into the bath.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain retreats, and it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that one should not use the cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, helps it: and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep place which is between the big toe of the foot and the instep, and it is closer to the instep.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dried goat dung, and ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not stop doing it until the sensation reaches the nail through the treatment and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Regarding the cauterization for back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Pain in the back sometimes occurs due to various causes, whether from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter; and cauterization is only applicable in this particular type which arises from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul pills and similar treatments, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the area itself. After marking with encaustic on each line five cauteries or more according to the quantity that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a cautery point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a median claw cautery according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing at the beginning of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often affects small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the onset of this in children is that it occurs upon him a constriction in breathing during elevation and movement: and you find at the last vertebrae of the spine and its joints that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take effect on every part of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery in two lines, or three: and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the area until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware of applying the cautery to the gibbosity that occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter Forty-Six.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold humidities that are dispersed to any part of the body, then when the pains occur in the feet, it is customary among physicians to properly call this gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout of cold causes is treated with methods of cure and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is so that you cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Oleander.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to prick on the surface of the foot, then do it with a puncture cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	And if the pains ascend up to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize over the entire knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, with this same Clavic cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	And if more of this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not plunge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	And if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then apply what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	And if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the wrists as two lines are drawn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	And if the pains remain in the fingers, then prick them on every joint and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	And if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both on all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the patient from good regimen or from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is established and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God by this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterizing in hernias.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a hernia occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bowel descends near the testicle, then you must advise the patient to abstain from eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the stool may descend from his abdomen.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and advise him to hold his breath until the bowel or intestine appears or exits.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with cautery below the hernia at the opening of the crest, with a mark whose end resembles half a circle directed towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery with this form of fire until it becomes white and emits sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or bowel to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand on the area to prevent the intestine from protruding: and you shall have parted the patient's thighs, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the marked spot, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the opening with it: or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the opening with it on the first try.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And wisely observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization hour, lest you burn it, and by this happen to the patient either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And you should know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation does not help.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be fine, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with other ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide nourishment for the duration of his healing, which soothes his stomach: so that the intestine does not come out during effort and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to rise after forty days, administer a properly made bandage, and let it remain for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be reduced from labor, and from fullness of food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he is healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are initial, and you wish that they do not worsen, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let one-third of it be burned from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it with what we have said: and nothing more shall be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said first: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with encaustic, and a line is placed across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a key-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Regarding the method of cauterizing for pains due to falls or blows.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in some limbs due to a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it must be cauterized with a Point cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery should be appropriate for the entire member according to its size, and its tenderness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat on the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is customary for these pains to shift from one member to the adjacent one.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to address them with cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Of the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes greatly benefited by the cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melanchole: when you wish to cauterize it, consider carefully.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the leprosy is stubborn, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it does not diminish nor remain stable: and you fear that the corruption may spread over the entire complexion of the patient: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known part of the head, and the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, apply your hand with the cautery for a moment until it makes a small imprint on the mouth, and the scabs are removed from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize also over the spleen itself, as previously described.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned in the chapter, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on both jaws, and two cauteries on the cervical vertebrae, and six on the dorsal vertebrae, and one large one on the alahosos near the tail bone and one above it, on the almeidati: and two on the hips: that is, one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tender areas of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and on the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves which are above the posterior part of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the mouth of the pelvis, and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the spleen.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater the benefit and the more it helps.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as much as healthy people do: because their body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of various sizes and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to which precedes from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with flour of the herb and honey, and continue the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When some limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a kind of numbness that affects the hand and foot at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let not one who is not wise in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the moving nerves presume upon it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing in Alvarus.
Caput LI.	Chapter Fifty-One.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Alvarus becomes old and none of the medical skills are effective on it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery briefly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of a dove, and blood of a swallow: let there be one part of each; mix all these together, and spread them over cloth, and apply in place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing in cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter Fifty-Two.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem right to me: for I fear that it may ulcerate: and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and its maturation is delayed either due to excess causing it or due to the age of the patient if they are frail and have little blood, or due to time and a need to hasten the maturation of the abscess, then cauterize around it with many small cautery points.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then use fire with the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be applied so that the subsequent course of the disease may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	About the method of cauterizing in a corrosive disease.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but corruption in a limb that spreads and corrodes it: just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then use many cauteries, small and large claviculae, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you root out the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains entirely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil on the cauterized areas until all the eschars are removed, and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with flesh-producing ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If you see that after three days flesh is born healthy, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cautery again over what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes treated with sharp medicine when corrosive.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises from the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is faster in providing relief: and I have already mentioned its cautery with sharp medicine in the division: so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered substance that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are indeed two methods of cautery for these: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, make a concave cautery similar to the feather of a vulture: it should be made of iron according to the size that can contain the claw on all sides: and it should have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it ignited upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plaisters to it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaister on it during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply cautery to them with warm water: and it is as follows, take a tube of metal, or iron, or from an eagle's quill: and place it over the nail, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a moment, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and let the warm water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a moment over the effect of the warm water's action for about an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this one by one until you have addressed all of them that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated with something that generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing in trembling.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When trembling occurs in someone due to cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another cause: then it is necessary to cauterize with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and a caustic between each vertebra, and on his chest with a caustic, and on his stomach with a caustic.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For trembling is calmed with olive oil cautery, and recovery from cold illness is hastened.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes in the body, Albathir causes ugly boils, that is, pustules, which are caused by corrupted thick materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they first appear, they should be cauterized on the entire head of the pustule with a fine cautery using myrtle wood, the end of which is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase: and the excess causing them is dispersed, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing in blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that blood flows from an artery which is cut at a wound, whether occurring externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or of a member's cautery, and similar cases; and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly reach with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and press it strongly until the blood is blocked under your finger, and nothing can escape from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small olive cauters and more numerous large ones on the fire, and blow on them until they become thoroughly ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the vein after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the blood flows out when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and do not cause further harm to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, its ends are contracted, and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it should be tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines with the property of severing the blood be applied to it, and constrict it with a properly tight poultice.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers its severance with a ligature and constriction with cloth, or by application of burning substances and similar methods, does not completely heal it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not present: then begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have mentioned, and constricting it very tightly until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but always cool it with very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and is severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And during this time, one should consider what it needs from a cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	¶ On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter about every illness in which it is appropriate to use fire for cauterization and burning medicine, and its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauters.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed the chapters from the top to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method: so that it may relieve the seeker of what he seeks.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O sons, what is in this chapter concerning the fear which is mentioned in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary to have a more vigorous caution, for in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, by which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision on the abscess, or opening of the fistula, or treatment of the wound, or extraction of the arrow, or incision on the stone, and those similar to these: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death often results from most of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you not to let hesitation overcome you, for sometimes methods of people with the methods of illnesses fall upon you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there are those among them who become angry with their illness, and death is轻于他对他的病情的强烈感受和其恶意的长久。 
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the illness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his ringing sound and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be stronger than your desire and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a praiseworthy succession arrives.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use it in the treatment of all your ailments, by prognosis and indication of that to which health appropriately leads.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is your assistance for gaining fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you with His understanding, O sons, and not deprive you of guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter of Cauterization, from the neck down to the feet: so that your search for what you want from it and what you need may be alleviated.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Regarding the treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment often occurs in children at birth: or when the midwife grasps the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it sometimes happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this disease in anyone other than children: and death came quickly to all of them whom I saw. Therefore, it seemed to me to abandon the treatment of this condition.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head swelled every day until he could not sit up because of the size of his head, and the swelling increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed gathers either between the skin and the bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation for this, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make one cut in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the cut should be about two finger widths, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then make two cuts in this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign of this is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides: and the water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and this is not hidden from you: then you must make three cuts in the middle of the head in this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the wounds with cloths and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then fumigate it with wine and oil from above until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let the head be bound with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak with all dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to determine where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of fluid appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more on the occiput, or on the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, make an incision where the abscess and the accumulation of fluid appear to you: and cut it open as much as possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And be careful not to cut the artery, and let there not be a flow of blood, and the patient does not die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Regarding the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrhs affect the eyes or the chest of someone, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment with medicines does not help: then the final remedy for that is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you want to incise them, the patient should shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a coarse cloth so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth he has.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then observe where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are the depressed areas behind the ears: and it is rarely concealed, except in some individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with cautery on both sides: and cut each one with a scalpel on both sides sharply, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it higher up with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood exits with a pulsating flow, which leaps into the interior frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a distance of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with cautery, and cut until you reach the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to let out of the blood is six ounces, and you may emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the amount that appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then attend to the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains attached to the bone from the incision, then cut it off, so that a warm abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the removal of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an individual suffers from chronic hemicrania or acute catarrhs due to the sharpness of humidities and heat in the temporal arteries, or severe ancient sodas and similar conditions: and if treatment with medical cures does not help: then we have found in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation for their extraction is to shave the hairs that are on the temples and focus on the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few individuals or due to extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth: then rub the area with a coarse cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the area with hot water until it appears to you with a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I shaped a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw the hook into it, and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin, and make it come out of the tissues beneath it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it the portion according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened, and drawn together, so that bleeding does not occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not fully stop.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood, down to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double, strong thread, of silk; or of the gut of a hen, so that corruption does not set in too quickly before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the excess that is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery up to the mouth: until its ends are cut and it remains in place for the same procedure.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work, unless the patient has a fever, or has a heated temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For cautery is one of those things that helps to stop moist discharges.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is better treatment.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old lint: and properly made poultices should be placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the dissolution, it should be treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth, and with lint, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then quickly proceed to sever it with a cautery, or fill the place with zegi: and hold your hand until the blood is severed.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are available to you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood凝固。 
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And pierce the area with water of intense coldness until the sharpness subsides and constricts as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract from the artery, you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to almadatem.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like the two knives, cold affects both quickly: and they do not cut the flesh swiftly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, because there is a little thickness in them, the heat of fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this method, the work is better than any other, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with cautery: and place both extremely hot until they reach the opening, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends is extended.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not coalesce completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp and constant tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins which are on the outer part of the skull: and no remedy with medicines can close them, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes are already corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients required this operation for their treatment, and named it the cure with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equidistant cuts on the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the cut be about two fingers, and one cut is equidistant in the middle of the nose, and the second along the length slightly from the movement of the eyelids, and the third from the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of all the cuts be the amount of three fingers joined: and have a piece of prepared sponge ready, or many dried cloths with which to dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temple side, to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with a knife, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a sharp little knife, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until it reaches what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make it in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a equal quantity runs out of blood, press the places from the clotted blood pieces.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place on every fissure lint from old cloth, and put on them small pieces imbued in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a warm abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs happen to someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and already the sight of them is weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, followed by sneezing: then consider these occurrences, that those materials and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you instruct the patient to rub their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another shortly across its width, and begin with an incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go up to the bone: and keep your hand away from the jaw temples, which move during mastication: until when the bone is exposed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with an old catgut, or with linen threads.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it with compresses: and soak the compresses with wine and oil, so that a hot swelling does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and see that the hot swelling has already diminished: then you must rub the area, until new flesh begins to grow.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth: such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from them, to be administered for the generation of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is of one of four types: either a mineral stone, or similar to stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and things like them: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When a stone or stone-like substance that does not add to or grow in the ear falls into it, expose the ear to the sun: if you see the stone, then drip something from violet oil or hyacinth into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction and make the person sneeze with condysis, and plug the nostrils as the sneeze comes, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it happens with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer its extraction with tweezers, that is, with fine pincers: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it comes out with tweezers, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, few-fold blind hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of metal, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and pack what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for air except through the tube: then extract with your strong inhalation through the tube.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often it comes out with what we have mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not come out this way, then take a small amount of birdlime or glue, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of a rod after you wrap a cloth properly around it; then insert it into the ear hole easily after you dry the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then hurry to incise before a warm abscess or spasms occur.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of the incision is to bleed the patient first in the cephalic vein: and let blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its fat in a depressed area: and let the incision be of a crescent shape until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instrument is possible for you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound by your hour with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If a thing falling into the ear is of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place it in many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine thread, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water that enters the ear, the patient must use sneezing with condysi at first: and already fill his ear with some old cooked substance: and he lies on that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, soft, and heat them with fire for a moment, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, he should not stop doing this with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water exits so that you take one from a parpyro or from a reed, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then insert another rush tube, and do this many times until all the water comes out: and draw it out with the cannula as was mentioned previously in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of a small body, like a flea, and similar, care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of a large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with hooks and forceps: and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something of the worms appears there, then extract it with hooks or with subtle forceps.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate it: then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you to come out, then seal around the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already used to destroy worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be such that the plunger which is in the concavity of the tube is properly made of bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton at its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cotton above, and press it with your hand in a moderate compression until the oil is pushed into the auditory cavity, and the patient feels it internally; and what is infused into the ear should already be warmed slightly with fire: and beware that what is distilled into it is not very cold; for the medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Regarding the treatment of ailments affecting the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some people that their ear canal has become obstructed due to an injury or flesh grown in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the deep part of the ear canal, which is not visible: and it sometimes affects the outer part of the canal slightly, which is visible.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs in the deep part of the ear and which is not visible, is in most cases difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the sight, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun, and look at it: then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a subtle spatula, whose form is as follows, its end should have some small width, part of which should be sharp: and the rest of the spatula should be of two smooth sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the obstruction is flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the obstruction is in the depth of the ear: then take a slender, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the obstruction with it, which the patient finds with heaviness of hearing, attempt to open it with ease: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a lint according to the size of the opening which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take lint, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle ground zedoary on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already forming an abscess: then you must remove the lint, and allow it to be with another piece of lint which you wrap in cerote made with rose oil until the warm abscess settles: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however a flow of blood occurs then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them on the ear and use the remaining treatment which stops the aforementioned flow of blood in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelid inflammation.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These eyelid inflammations that occur in the eyelids are sometimes moist and are sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you must hold them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them out with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground zegi on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of eyelid tumors.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles granulomas in their strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Granum: and it is an aggregation of coarse humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is to consider then if there is a stone coming out of it, which appears from the eyelid, and they move to all parts, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore on it a fissure across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then remove the outer layer from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however the cutting off of it is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it harms the patient somewhat.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then join it with stitching and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and causes flesh to grow over it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the stone is inclined towards the inside of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, and suspend the stone with a hook; besides which you may need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is extended by an incision, it does not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the stone is cut out with salty water: and treat the area with something that causes flesh to grow over it until the patient heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Regarding the treatment of AXIRNATH of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is the fat that forms in the lining of the upper eyelids: and this happens most often to children; and it weighs down their eyes, and they get catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at sunlight because tears rush to them, and you see them always lying on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, which inflation has now covered: and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of the operation is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare some wax on it, and make a circle out of that wax according to the size that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on it, and press with your fingers on all sides so that Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a scalpel making incisions through its width, and let not the incision be deeper than that which is made in bloodletting.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many cases Axirnath protrudes from the incision in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it with a cloth that you have inserted between your fingers to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: and be careful not to insert anything into the incision so that you do not reach the eye with the scalpel and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you should add a little more easily into the fissure until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who rub salt and place it in the concavity of the fissure, so that what remains of the moisture may melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a warm abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the conditions of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid softens, causing it to droop more than it should.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the natural course and become old: then they harm the eye and cause various illnesses to occur, such as continuous tearing, softening of the eyelids, and opacification, until it becomes a cause for the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	It is treated by cutting and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with tubes, as I say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the probe.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with the spatula applied from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place a small piece of cloth or linen under the eyelid: then mark on the eyelid with wax, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be done according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: for it now varies among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need a large portion to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that is relaxed from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let the incision be near the natural hairs, as thick as the probe.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the entire area.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then sew together the two lips with a fine thread of wool using a needle: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what remains of the threads above the two eyebrows, with some adhesive substances, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three days, or four: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and care for it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining: but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treatment.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is careful attention to the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is to mark on the eyelid a figure that resembles the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have mentioned.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, according to this following shape, then cut away what is excess with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal cuts.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not align: then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert one thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and bring the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with equal elevation: and lift the skin over which the marked seam is, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If it happens that a swelling occurs near your incision or your cut: relieve that swelling with cerote and similar substances from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And it sometimes happens to the eyelids that their hairs turn inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we have said about the incision on it: but suturing both is more skilled.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Regarding the treatment of ataxmia with reed tubes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is such that you turn the eyelid and split the fissure which is inside, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two reed tubes or two fine sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you will now incise at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully bring each one over the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reed tubes on both sides with a strong tie, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For skin that is tightly bound will die, and turn black, and become putrid, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it solidifies, lift the eyelid: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cans, which you will make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the removal of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is such that you take a fine needle and insert into it a thread made of fine, soft silk.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bring together the ends of it and tie each end with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then arrange another fine thread under it briefly, and knot the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clearly seen: for it is a fine or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to above the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the eyelash is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the eyelash downward, using the thread you made for it, until the eyelash comes out from the upper opening, and you can see it with your eye: then pull the eyelash and the thread: extract both, and close the eye: leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either attach a long hair from natural hairs to it, and lift with it: or leave it until it grows longer over time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of an eyelash injury occurring in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental Alxatrati occurs from the healing of wounds, or cuts, or cauterizations, and similar procedures.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment is to split that healing, and to separate its edges, and place a strip of linen between them, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use drying and constricting substances in its treatment: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use things that soften it, such as Greek hay: and foment with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been cooked: and anoint with liquid dyaquilon mixed with some oil: and wrap it with a linen cloth, and treat it thus.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your care is that you endeavor with all your ingenuity that it not become consolidated, according to the form which was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have mentioned is merely a correction of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return entirely to what it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the treatment of Alxatrati which is performed on the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This condition which occurs below is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a tear, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of the operation is to take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the awl, and place it in the tear, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two tears on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two tears be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when brought together they form this shape, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said about the softening medicines and plasters until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an Alxatrati occurs due to a cut, suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to make a flat incision under the eyelash hairs, according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a plaster as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discourse on the treatment of Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed accordingly as it is prepared according to the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed of many diversities in form: and the prudent artisan prepares with whatever manner is possible to him until he restores the figure to its natural form or near it, and the patient himself according to what is suitable to him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you must introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adherence with a delicate spatula that is not sharp like a cutting spatula, but rather slightly blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula does not harm the eye with its sharpness; and let your incision be such that you pare away that adherence easily until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adherence heals.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salty water into the eye, wash it with water: or distill onto it from a sieve made from dissolved zinc and water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with flax oil: and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye: and after the third day use a sieve, and with plasters, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the eyelid and the protruding flesh of the tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the eyelid can be cut in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard, delicate sieve.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with a iron, or you try to take it with a hook, breaks apart, and the hook does not hold onto it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin unless from the larger tear duct, extending gradually until it covers the sight and obstructs the light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating in its incision is: that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the eyelid with a hook of few twists, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the horse, ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a moment, and fix it in the middle of the eyelid: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the eyelid with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the eyelid that follows the pupil, as if you were sewing it with the hair to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that the continuous flow of tears is not impeded by its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with a hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware that the spatula does not touch the horny membrane, and that no rupture occurs in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw some ground salt into the eye, or something made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the claw is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this kind of claw is often treated with medications and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a fine, gentle spatula of mild sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the claw gently from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it becomes稀薄和破裂，并且刻刀在其上留下印记，那么用你的时间向眼睛滴入由ziniar制成的细丝，或红色细丝，或磨碎的盐：然后封住眼睛直到第二天。
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then again on the same operation, until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a warm aposteme contrary to you in the eye: then let it be, and treat the aposteme until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then perform the operation on it reasonably, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the lacrimal flesh harms the eye greatly, it should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it should be cut off: and do not make the incision too deep, so that the course of tears is not affected.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then apply a red salve to the lacrimal area, or one made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh is formed or positioned over them until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a damask rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is such that the patient should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh initially with a scalpel until the entire removal is completed.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful with the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your cut with which you cut it be, either with a spatula, which we mentioned in the cutting of the hoof: or with small scissors, with which basil is gathered, according to how its form will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your cut is completed and all thealguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or sprinkle on it red powder and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye outside a cloth with egg white: so that it is secured from a warm abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If any of the alguardenici remains and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a warm abscess: then abandon the eye and treat it with that which soothes the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the procedure on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly treat the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to avoid the treatment of any weak eye by natural means or by accidental means, using iron: and do not involve your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Regarding the removal of sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter Eighteen.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that form over the eye and prevent it from functioning properly: and they weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is sebel is strong and has no other illness besides the sebel: then remove the sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be of subtle double bend, according to this form, or let there be two hooks set stepwise in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with subtlety, and cleanse the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they dissolve: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at noon in the presence of the sun, and be firm in your operation very much: so that you cut only those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed, then distill into the eye green sap or red: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with something that alleviates the pain of the eye: and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides: and it shall be secured from a warm abscess: then proceed on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Regarding the restoration of Arissati to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians name Arissati the Fistula, which you treat with a cautery or with an acute burning medicine, according to what was previously described.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in it: unless you incise above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus within it until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is named Asperi capitis.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of Indian iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which should be pointed with the fineness of a file or with a subtle prick of an aliskilfer: and place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand for a moment until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with drying and astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the area is consolidated and new flesh grows there, and the course of pus is stopped: and it remains for forty days without returning, without abscessing, and no accident occurs in it: then you know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless you redirect the fistula to the nasal aperture according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is such that you expose the second bone with iron or a sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the iron end be triangular: and its wood should be a tapered pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the mouth itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and move your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and let the patient feel it; by which he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the material which was flowing outward returns to the nose: thus it is a milder condition for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Regarding the reduction of a protrusion of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter Twenty.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes entirely, and no harm or reduction occurs in vision: then you must comfort the patient: then bleed him: afterwards place cupping on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye an ointment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and gum Arabic.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye over the poultice with many bandages.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the bandages is: take soft cloths, many of them, and fold each cloth into four: make many of them: then place them one on top of another according to the amount needed by the eye: then bind them tightly with a strong binding using a hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the suction, and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage softens again, then it must be tightened greatly: then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has returned to the grape skin, it is good: and if not, then again apply the plaster, the powder, the bandage, and the suction, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the grape skin.
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the grape skin, then it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the person is marred because of this, and you wish to cut it: then the procedure for it is, as I narrate: and it is to insert a needle at the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the double thread, and tie it to the grape part around the needle: and tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it until the thread falls off with the grape.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is bound all around with a circle of cloth until it gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the whitish moisture flow out, and the eye descends, and immediately proceed: then bind it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Regarding the treatment of Alcomnati.
Caput XXII.	Chapter Twenty-Two.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called Alcomnati is not anything but a pus that gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to have the patient sit on a prepared seat or stand straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from two sides and move it until you see the pus come to the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it should be fixed, and not allowed to descend, and the light should be restored: and the patient should see things as he saw before: and if it does not go down further, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the pus does not prepare to descend with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and use it to pierce slightly above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer in the crown, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled Greek hay and honey: then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water descending into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter Twenty-Three.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the types of water in the division and what is suitable for piercing, declaring and explaining it, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary to have the patient sit between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye tightly, and press it strongly: then with your right hand if the eye containing water is the left eye, or with your left hand if it is the right eye, hold his eyelid.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the probe if the eye is the left: or with your left hand if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the probe near the cornea at the thickness of the radius where the white of the eye is visible near the smaller lacrimal: then push the probe with force: and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and you will feel that the probe has now reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measurement of the probe's journey to the depth be the distance from the pupil to the end of the black part: and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the pupil of the eye itself due to the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the probe until it reaches the location where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it below once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water descends immediately, then the patient sees what he opens his vision to immediately, and the eyelid in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore water descends, then remove it secondly, except for the eyelid to exit.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not rise: then remove the eyelid with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye the entire piece of cotton, or wool soaked in rose oil, and goose grease: and bandage the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place ground cinnamon with egg white on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the eyelid does not obey you for entering into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a person whose eye is very hard: then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, insert with it only the connector, and do not put your hand deeply into the hole: and you do this only to make a way to the subtle place of the eyelid.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the eyelid as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, let a properly made sleeping place be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that suits his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the binding be according to its arrangement up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then unbind him in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then bind it again until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done during the time of healing, or immediately after the incision: rather, it should be avoided because water ascends quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to unbind the eye before the seventh day: and treat it with what calms the abscess until it is calmed: then restore its sight, and place over his face a covering to regulate his vision under it for several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually come out of the house and move about in his own chambers.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zaltea the student is not excused from seeing several times: then he may dare to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed it has come to our attention from some who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a pipe was made through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from wax, so that one who is ignorant may stand over them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from proper bronze: and let their ends be shaped with the same fineness into triangles, and let the end be sharp.
Formae magda.	Wax forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh growing in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes diverse kinds of flesh grow in the nose, some of which resemble multi-footed scorpions: and from these is a cancerous, stony, brownish flesh: and there is also one which is soft flesh, not brownish in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In those among these flesh growths that are soft, not deceptive, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, and open his nostrils, and cast a hook into those flesh growths: then pull them outwards, and cut what you grasp of them with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh is now removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If any part remains that cannot be cut off: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply what is appropriate to it: or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterize it until the blood is severed and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after the cut vinegar, and water, or wine is thrown into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that flesh has grown within the upper nasal bones to which the instrument does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to introduce a linen thread which has some thickness and many knots in it: place between each knot the length of a finger, or less: the patient should be instructed to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a tube, or whatever is possible for him after he makes it similar to azer: and he should draw it inward until it reaches the cavity, and exit above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, boys in schools often do something similar to this: and it is easy for one who wishes to do so.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then the flesh with the knots on the thread should be carefully cut.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then withdraw the thread: and place in the nose after wiping away the blood a licinium that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the thing in the nose a tube of lead for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it requires treatment which dries, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head purgation device, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver or bronze: so that it is similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell: and its spout similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making head purgation should be full, open: to which there is a handle at the end of it, with which you hold it when you heat oil or what you wish from juices and liquid substances in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the treatment of nasal polyps.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a polyp grows at the end of the nose, and it enlarges and increases with days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to cut it down at the beginning of its appearance and root out all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine that serves in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous growth.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that when an abscess is cut open in a person, great harm results from it for the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess has a soft touch, is not of a dark color, and you see that it can be completely incised, then evacuate the diseased matter, and cut it without fear, without dread: and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	About sewing the nose, the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation is of little benefit, except in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something like that happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood: then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures: then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the edges of the disrupted continuity are already separated and each part has become healed: then you must remove all the skin from its visible surface until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two edges with sutures and bind them tightly, and dust over it dragon's blood and powdered frankincense: and place a piece of diaphoretic plaster over the powders, and another consolidating plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of sewing is to join the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have mentioned in the stitching of the abdomen; or join the separation with thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the removal of lip knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from hard swellings similar to grains of a herb, mostly on the inner parts of their lips: some of them are smaller, and others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn the lip inside out and cut above the entire knot, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the area after the incision with ground zegi until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be treated with vinegar, and the area where there is astringency should be cared for until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of the flesh growth above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often, additional flesh grows above the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you must suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus to flow, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place ground zegi or other astringent, drying powders on the area.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	About the reason for teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes on the surfaces of teeth, from the inner and outer part, and between the gums, rough, ugly crusts gather, and they sometimes blacken and turn yellow and green until corruption from that reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the mill and the tooth where the crusts appear, until nothing of them remains, and do likewise with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If what is in them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until finally your effort achieves what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that a tooth requires scrapers of various forms and many shapes: according to how they are prepared for your operation: therefore, the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of scrapers should be prepared and available to you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	About the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must cure the tooth of its pain with all ingenuity and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted, since it is a substance of high value. Therefore, when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it must be extracted when the patient is compelled, so that it may be stabilized and you may be certain about the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a sound tooth and extract it; then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful tooth is confirmed to you, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula that has some efficacy until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps firmly on it, and hold the head of the patient between your knees; once you have a good grip so that it does not move, then pull the tooth straight out so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and attempt to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth and grasp it with the tip of a slender probe so that it does not break when you clamp it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you perform the scarification around the gum meticulously from all sides greatly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and let part of it remain, and let it return upon the sick from that恶意which is greater than his first pain. 
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness regarding the removal of it, besides administering what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great illnesses to occur in people, the healing of which is more difficult, and all its roots remain or some of them; or they extract it along with some bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be treated after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then grind something from spurge, and fill the area with it: and if not, cauterize it if spurge is not available to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of delicate forceps with which the tooth is moved should have long ends, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth: the handles should be thick as you see, so that when you grip them, they do not slip or bend: the ends should be short, and made of Indian iron or well-made steel, with straight ends: and at their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter and grip firmly with a proper constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the ends are made in the shape of the mouth of a bird called a stork, and they have a strong grip.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Regarding the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains attached to the tooth that is being extracted, then it is necessary to place goat's hair with butter on the area for one day or two days until the area softens; then insert algasti or forceps, whose ends resemble the mouth of a bird called stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file inside: or like aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If it does not obey and come out with these forceps, then you must make a cavity above the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the end be short and somewhat thick: and let it not be hollow, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out with this, it is good: and if not, assistance must be given with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular end, which has some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the slender triangular end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Assistance is also given with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have been mentioned previously in the discussion of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Assistance is also given with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular end, which has some thickness so that it does not break: and let it not be hollow.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you shall know that the instruments of teeth are many: and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and the wise craftsman, subtle in his art, finds the instrument by himself according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For there are bitternesses to which the ancients did not speak of an instrument because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If however the bone is fractured from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or it putrefies: then examine it in its place with what is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with a lever, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it something of gradually increasing thickness, so that the bone may be grasped or held firmly, and not slip away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines appropriate for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the filing of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the appearance is marred by this: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, in public women.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or its filing or smoothing is not possible: then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak and is made of hardened iron with a very sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be where you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If it is prominent and requires filing: then file it with an iron file, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of strong small points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out: then smooth it, at the end scrape it with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth from which a part is broken and it injures the tongue: then it must be filed until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is leveled: and flattened, so that it does not injure the tongue or impair speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Regarding the rotation of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken and jarred by a blow or fall: and the patient cannot bite down on what he eats so it does not fall out: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the treatment was ineffective: then the method is to bind them with gold thread: for silver turns green and rots after some days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of medium thickness according to the size that fits between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And indeed the form of rotation is that you take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth: then weave with the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the needle all the way to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving all the way back to the part from which you started: and hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not removed entirely: and let your constriction as you pull the thread be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors: and bring together both ends, and tie them tightly: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a loose tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then leave it thus tight as long as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it loosens or breaks, tie them with another thread, and it will stay that way for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth and the figure of rotation of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And it sometimes happens that one or two teeth return to their places after falling out and are retained as we have described and remain: and none but a wise and experienced artisan can do this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of cow's bone is adapted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in position, whereby the tooth is secured and tightened as we have said: and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and impedes speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from an injury that has already solidified.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient in your hand, and lift his tongue: then cut that nervous ligament across until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted, and it is due to the consolidation of an injury: then apply a hook to it, and cut it across until you sever the ligament and loosen the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware that the cut does not go deep into the flesh and sever an artery there, causing a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then sew up the trace of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a strip of linen, which the patient should hold throughout the night: so that it does not solidify again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then place ground zeggium on the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a mottled cautery that suits it: then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Chapter on the removal of the ranula which forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and it may grow so large until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun: and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If then you see it is of a brown or black color, hard, to which the patient does not feel sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then apply a hook to it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If the blood overpowers you during your operation, then apply ground zegi until the blood coagulates: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the appropriate further treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of abscesses of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat glands, which resemble almonds that occur externally: and they are called the two tonsils: which when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then examine.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If then it is a hard abscess, of a brown color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, but rather leave it alone until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white color, round, and its root is slender: then it must be cut open.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the procedure is such that before performing the operation, you should consider whether the warm abscess has completely subsided or decreased somewhat: then have the patient sit facing the sun, and let his head be in your lap: open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press his tongue below with an instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is fine like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press the tongue with it and the abscess is revealed to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, along with some of the tissue.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, which has the following form.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles scissors: however, its ends should be curved so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other's point: hence, make sure it is made of hardened iron or steel.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a spatula, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the bleeding is stopped: then care for it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And at times, abscesses other than the two tonsils develop in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them accordingly as I have said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have indeed treated a woman with an abscess that had developed in her throat, which was drawing her to darkness, loss of senses, and nearly closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had almost reached death, if it had lasted for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, extending over the two nasal openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I hurried quickly and attached a hook to one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it where it protruded from the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which protruded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue. Then I inserted a hook into the abscess. Then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood flowed out. Therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, then took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long period of time: and the abscess succeeded in place of what I was cutting, until it was extended too much and with it that condition.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore devised and cauterized the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It therefore stood from the addition: then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Regarding the incision of an abscess on the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula and it becomes abscessed and is long: then it is called perpendicular. And if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment does not succeed: and you see that the warm abscess has subsided from it and is thin: then it is necessary to cut it open.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if what is aggregated from it is round and does not have length, and is of a bloody or brown or black color, and does not have sensation: then it is necessary to avoid cutting it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is fear over the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described by its whiteness and length, make the sick person sit before the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument of which I previously spoke: then insert the hook in the fold, and pull it down: and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for incising both tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you must not cut from it except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have mentioned in the incision of both tonsils: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If the sick person is terrified of the incision: then you must use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and worry.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization for it is not without sharp water: and it is to place the sick person's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take of the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix it with unextinguished charcoal, and make it not too thick nor too thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the end of it where the medicine is placed be concave, like the cavity of a spoon's bowl.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine on the ulcer itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth due to internal medicine, so that nothing of it descends to his throat and injures him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should apply it to the ulcer for half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the irritation of the medicine calmed.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a quill, and wrap it around the end of the rod, and pour the medicine into the quill, and insert the rod with the quill into the tube above, until the quill adheres to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it dried up and fell off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, clean around the ulcer with a quill soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine: and mix it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it should be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore, this method of treatment is more beneficial than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the ulcer is treated with something finer than cauterization and incision: it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a reed, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sesame, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar ones among herbs: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boiled: and the pot should be plastered with clay decently: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot on which a concave instrument is set according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze: and insert the end with the ball into the mouth of the sick person until the vapor rises to the throat above the tube, until the throat is greatly obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then apply it repeatedly on it until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the onset of the abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually increases the abscess: and you should not do this unless at the stage when the abscess is declining and becoming cooler.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not available to you, then take a cane, and attach a piece of ox horn to its end so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: for the ox horn prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment that ensures safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a fish bone or spine, or something else, adheres to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what is apparent from them where the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the light, and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached matter will be expelled by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Let the sick person swallow a piece of ginger, or the root of lettuce, or let them swallow a piece of dry bread: or take a piece of soft dried sea sponge: tie it to a string, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the place where the spines are, or the bone, and is pulled out, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument made of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius for a moment, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he can introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him be careful not to touch his epiglottis, so that he does not cause a cough, and push the bone or spine with it, or let the physician insert it with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person inserts is better: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached object: and push it downwards, or pull his hand upwards with the instrument, doing all this according to the amount prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Regarding the removal of leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is treated with what I said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in front of the sun, or near the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers properly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a concave tube, and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat; then introduce a heated iron into the concavity of the tube.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth over it: and bring his mouth close to it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and move the water with his hand once an hour.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with bugs, or with ashes using the instrument I described for fumigating the throat.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, for it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is to take a pot in which there are burning coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument should be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty foods, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary to proceed with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon it by sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of abscesses, their incision, and general care.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of various types, according to the recollection of them, that is, one and another in this book: and they are diverse in their puncturing and incision by two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One is of the kind of abscess in itself and that which it encompasses from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to the places where it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an aposteme occurring on the head is different from an aposteme occurring on the anus: and an aposteme occurring in a fleshy part is different from an aposteme occurring in joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among the apostems are those which should not be lanced until the pus in them is matured and complete: and among them are those which should be lanced while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like the apostemes which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an aposteme occurs near a joint and extends to be part of it until what is around it putrefies, the ligaments or nerves of that joint may be corrupted: hence it is a cause nearer to the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an aposteme near a principal member: for if you delay piercing it until it matures, it will harm either that member or the principal member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, pierce it therefore while immature: and you should not lance an aposteme that is raw and undigested, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or result in something at its end that cannot be healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You must know the time for lancing an aposteme that has matured according to completion: and this is when there is a subsiding of pain, recession of fever, and reduction in redness, and pulsation, and sharpness at the head of the aposteme: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and of more prominent elevation: and let the perforation go along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in parts of hands and feet, and areas of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the abscess is in fleshy areas: then it is better to leave the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged, and there is much filth and dirtiness, and perhaps its lips and depth may harden.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body in necessity: or according to what the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses: or many incisions according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be scooped out: and cut when it has become like cloth, and reached the point where it is already dead: such as those that occur in many, like dubet and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are some that are cut with a three-angled incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is one by which it is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which round incision and crescent-shaped incision are made: and similar to these from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, like mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial puncture, or only flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you not hurry and extract all the pus at that hour: rather extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cleanse the abscess until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to the progression, until it is expelled: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an aged invalid: for the animal spirit is often resolved from the body with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, be cautious with this chapter with great care.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your piercing with which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If the wound of the abscess is small, or it is a flat incision, then apply lint from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess, and many perforating cracks are present, then you must insert lint into every crack until they reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away part of the skin in an abscess, or scraped around it: then it is necessary to fill it with old felt, or as when a cloth is stitched, or shaved with linen down without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then discard it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to administer treatment, and care, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is during the winter season, and the site of the abscess is near many nerves: then it is necessary to pour powder with warm wine and oil: and place them on the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during the summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary to place powders soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of it should be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day arrives, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess, and clean it, and administer what is appropriate for its treatment until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of swellings universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every swelling, how the way to its cure is treated separately in chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of swellings that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small swellings occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kinds of Knots, which are contained in the membranes that serve as their sacks: they are like the fat of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fatty: some contain moisture similar to mud: some contain moisture similar to boiled dishes and poultices: and others similar to these, and some are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them and their removal, there is no fear, as long as an artery does not oppose at the site of their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure in their incision is to examine them with an instrument whose form comes after this, which is called the Introducer, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a longitudinal superficial incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin the incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst that contains the moisture, and do not leave anything of it entirely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if something of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if it is available: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the cloth with the second Egyptian method, and the third, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty knot: then cut it according to this shape, with the incision having the form of a cross: and place hooks between the two lips of the incision, and scrape it from all sides: and attempt your skill in extracting the tissue that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do for the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier: because it contains little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in certain individuals, which contain no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I cut into an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess to be like a solid, hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken: and if anyone struck it, it would wound them.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other swellings occurring on the head, besides these swellings which occur on the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the puncture always from the lower part of them, so that the course of pus may be alleviated towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with what is appropriate for its treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Regarding the incision of strophulas on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These swellings often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur on the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And regarding those that occur on the neck, there can be one or many: and they are generated from each other: and every strophula among them is within its own proper covering, just as it is with the knots and swellings of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these strophulas are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them are stone-like ones: and there are those that contain moistures: and there are malignant ones that do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one which you see among them of good disposition to the touch, whose color is clearly near the skin's color, and which moves to every part, and is not attached to the neck's nerves, nor to the vertebrae, nor to the artery, and is not deep: it is necessary to incise it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b. to line g., and scrape it from all sides: and extend the two skin lips with a hook, or with multiple hooks if you need them, as we have said in the swellings of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is for caution, so that a vein or nerve is not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp: so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or artery and it prevents you from the operation, then apply ground zegi or certain powders that stop the flow of blood to the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the inflammation subsides and the wound softens: or it begins to turn and wants to become putrefied.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped with a bandage. Return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then probe with your index finger if anything of the small Strophulus remains; then cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the root of the Strophulus: then you must not cut that Strophulus from its root: rather, you must tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cataplasm that you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophulus is cut, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew it immediately, as soon as you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is excess remaining because of the size of the Strophulus, then you must proceed to cut its root and remove it: and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which contains moistures from sties, pierce it with a superficial puncture: so that the site of its maturity may be apparent to you: and place the puncture from what follows next below in the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply after the puncture a licinia with ointment, and similar things to it, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed: then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis caused by an abscess occurring inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those suffering from synanche, however, it is necessary to avoid incising the epiglottis: for no benefit is gained by that: therefore, because all the veins and lungs are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to avoid destruction which results from obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do this, we should cut the epiglottis below three or four rings of the epiglottis, with a small incision in width, in what is between two rings by the amount that the section is in soft tissue, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he must extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should incise the skin until he reaches the canal: he should avoid the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifac that we mentioned: it is indicated by the discharge of phlegm from the canal when it is severed, and by the cutting off of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	Therefore, when the time of suffocation is past, bring together the two edges of the skin wound, and suture only the skin itself without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse that we have mentioned is not applicable unless they see that one of these abscesses has swollen the patient's throat: and the patient is raised above death, and wants his breathing to be cut off: they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the wound site in some manner and be saved from death: and for this reason, they ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and it lasts for three days or nearly so: then they order to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen myself is that one servant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, cutting with it a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called for her treatment, and I found her groaning, as it is the groan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I uncovered the wound, and I found that the blood that had come out of the wound was little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was relieved that she had not cut the vein, nor the gut; and wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I hurried and treated the wound, and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the incision of the throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling named throat hernia is a large swelling according to the color of the body: and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural case, there is certainly no danger.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental case occurs in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to the swelling that occurs from the结扎动脉。
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it, and one should not presume to approach it with iron unless it is small: and you should examine it and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not hanging with any veins: then cut it like knots are cut: and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the area with what is necessary for the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the incision on types of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of knots, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I explain here the difference between a knot and an excrescence: as it may cause confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that with an excrescence there is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the effervescence of superfluities is calmed, and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a knot, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they are contained in cysts called sifachin, which are their own sacs, and they are according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and they grow like a batecha, being larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a knot, you should examine it and inquire about it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to how its form will be presented in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigation of abscesses and all nodes is to take this instrument and insert it into the moister place that you find in the abscess: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then move your hand according to the measurement of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw what was inserted, and examine what comes out in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the wake of what was inserted, then you know that it is thick: therefore cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and remove the skin from all sides easily: and keep the fistula, if you can, over it, so that you extract it along with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then remove it in pieces until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any part of it, small or large, remains, the node will return in full measure.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overpowers you and a small part remains: then fill the wound at the completion with certain sharp corrosive powders: bind the wound, and place over it something warm where the abscess sits, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large knot, then sew its two lips, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a pulsating vein opposite you, or non-pulsating: then hurry, and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it tight for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the blood boiling ceases: then return to cut what remains of the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding the outer instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of introducers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these, there is the large one, and from these is the medium one, and from these is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from square-ended alfulud iron, appropriately, so that they may quickly enter into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the experiencers, and no, that is, the perforators: and one of them is named beris, that is, perforating: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these, there is the large one, the medium one, and the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are used to investigate abscesses, sinuses, fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like large needles with which chairs are sewn, from citrine, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones are those made from lemon.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there is also an experience with black lead, which is used to test fistulas, whose concavities have reflections, so that they are reflected with their softness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them there are long ones, from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of hooks, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For there are simple ones among them, that is, those which have a single curvature: and they are of three species as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And there are blind hooks among them: and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And there are hooks having two curvatures among them, and they are of three species: and there are hooks having three curvatures among them, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three species: for there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends of them with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not used in this manner unless to provide assistance in skinning knots near the fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that through them the patient may be healed and find temporary relief from burning which is found in skinning abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are scissors, and they have three varieties.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of copper, and they resemble a still with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end there are hidden points of spatulas: and through it runs to the inside, and to the outside when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers for puncturing abscesses: and the patient does not feel them: and they are of three varieties, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Forms of lancets with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three varieties, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They shall be made of copper or brass, round, to a moderate length, as you see: and they should be slender.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that you have these varieties of lancets, large and small: to cut off the blood quickly in an emergency, and then when medicine is not present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut off blood from every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy areas: such as the thighs, hips, arms, nipples, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments similar to the blades of knives are made from them according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of bloodletting or from a vein or artery incision: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	The treatment of men's nipples which are similar to women's nipples.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter Forty-Seven.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of some men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble women's nipples: and they remain foully abscessed.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid this, should cut above the nipples in a crescent shape, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then sew together the two edges of the wound, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the nipple inclines downward and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it must be cut on both of its upper sides with two similar crescent-shaped incisions, each of which is connected to the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove the skin that is between the two edges, and take away the fat, and administer what we have said about suturing and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you cannot complete the incision that you need to make due to the restlessness of the patient or due to blood flow: then you must fill the wound with a sponge soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the puncturing of an abscess, which occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the hard species of Strophularia, which contains cysts, and from them come those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those that contain moisture should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. When all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old lint and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the lint and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the hard knot species of Strophularia, then incise it as we have said in the section on incising Strophularia equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the wound extends to discharge pus, then apply a cautery to it as we have said in what has been previously stated.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to an Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes hardened, an abscess often results from this. Similarly, it happens with veins, resulting in an abscess and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflammation are due to the Artery and Vein are: for when the swelling is due to the artery, it is long, gathered in the depths of the body: and when you press the swelling with your fingers, you feel as if it were making a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the Vein, is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And to cut on this swelling is an error, and especially so when it is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, the care of it should be avoided with iron, and what is also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, for that which comes from the swelling of the arterial opening, find a cut in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the cut with hooks, then the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate all the way to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to which I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the area between the two ligatures with a scalpel until all the blood within it comes out and the swelling is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place you are holding with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the abscess with a good binding: according to what I told you about binding a grape, from two sides with the two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the needle's incision: press and hold your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle until what is inside comes out: then cut off the excess skin, and release what was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it the poultice which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which is done with plasters and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Regarding the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so does an abscess occur in nerves: which happens to them through percussion or excessive labor and similar causes: and it most often occurs in places like the helper joints or heels, and in any place where joints are moved: and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in most conditions without pain: and when it is squeezed with vehemence, the patient feels a sensation similar to stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated abscess in the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it can be moved in all directions, nor does it move forward or backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is present at the joints should not be penetrated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps a contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In those cases where it is on the head or on the forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter Fifty-One.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Sometimes, many people experience growths in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, called Fungalia, named by similarity to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned outward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small: and some of them become greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and in his abdomen were two tumors, which were more like mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their lips were inverted, and ended, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I cut them, and found one to weigh nearly ten and eight ounces and the other nearly six ounces. And the operation in cutting them is such that you should then consider if the patient is moist, and the color of the tumors is white, moist, with fine roots: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cautery irons ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled at the cutting of it: therefore hurry if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient fearful and timid about being cut with the iron, then take a properly made lead wire, and tie it around the tumor: its size is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead binding.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, do not stop binding with lead whenever it presses on the tumor, until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the tumor has a thick root, then there is something to fear and be anxious about in its cutting, especially if it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut through half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to incise the tumor which is of a dark color, has little sensation, and an ugly appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I will come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of the navel prominence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel prominence occurs for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the sifac, which is above the belly: and althub or intestine protrudes from it, according to what happens in other hernias.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows from a vein or an artery, according to what has been mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind confined in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a fissure of the sifac and the protrusion of thirbi: then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and its position varies.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is much more diverse than what we have mentioned.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then it returns, and there may be a sound with it: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, causing much labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to moisture, then it is soft and does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it retract or increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	And if it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the slope.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	And if it is due to flesh generated: then the abscess is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	And if it is due to flatulence, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the procedure is such that you should then consider if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of Arteries, or Veins, or flatulence: then you must refrain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread, as I have taught you in the chapter where I said about abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	And if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or the colon: then you must advise the patient to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with cautery around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then advise him to lie supine in your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then circle with a broad spatula around the navel over the place you marked with cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the center of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him tightly around the circumference with thread or with silk cord firmly: and let the knot of the binding be strong.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the center of the extended abscess above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find it already caught by a ligament: then extract the hernia, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a polyp, then take hold of it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the artery or vein is opposite you: then tie it tightly around.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles around the area you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then bind the abscess at four points above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the protrusion of the navel is due to hard flesh in it or moisture: then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what consolidates the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Regarding the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the classification of types of cancer and how to approach its treatment with medicines: and we must be cautious when treating it with surgery so that it does not become ulcerated: and we have discussed cancer generated in the uterus and precautions for its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes the Cancer is in a place where its removal is possible: such as Cancer which is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and those similar, from parts located for extracting all of it: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it becomes old, and is large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from it: nor have I seen anyone before me who has reached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and release the patient from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed it if you find it with obvious fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for the preparation in which he is placed for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the Cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then scoop it from all sides with the skin, according to the exploration, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but press the areas, and wipe all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there from the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the thick blood flow from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Regarding the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already narrated in the division of the types of Hydropisis, and how the aggregation of water occurs: and the signs of every type, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the asclitis type alone: and it is not approached with iron in the timpanitis type: nor thoroughly in the hyposarcae type: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of Hydropisis timpanitis with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already acquired weakness, or there is another illness with him besides Hydropisis: such as if he has cough, or diarrhea, and similar to these: then beware of treating him with iron: for there is fear in that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a patient of abundant strength, and there is no illness with him besides Hydropisis alone: and he is neither a child nor an old person: then the method of operation is as follows, that you lift the patient standing between your hands, and a helper behind him should press his belly with his hand to drive the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spine-like spatula according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it have two sharp ends, long, with an acute tip like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be some gradual shortening in it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine and damage it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a cut from the navel by the length of three fingers, towards the lower area directly above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your cut be to the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it is also not appropriate for there to be a cut on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the sifac, as if you are flaying it: and let the amount that is flayed be the size of a nail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the sifac until the spatula reaches the empty space: and that is the location of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or brass, or bronze, smooth, polished: which has at its lower part a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side, and one from the other side: and the face is its cut end, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate more than is proper from it, perhaps the patient may die in an hour by the dissolution of his animal spirit; or he may suffer a syncope that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is retained immediately due to the skin which holds the hole that is on the syringe; of which I have spoken, so as to pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the procedure the next day, if you see the patient tolerate it: and also evacuate a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard against error: until there is only a little of the water left.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient and leave much of the water: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him thirst: and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, the liver, and the spleen, after the extraction of water: as I have spoken in what precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Regarding the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When one of the infants exits the womb of his mother, and his meatus urinis is not perforated, or there is a narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to intervene with the piercing of it immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin pin made of lead in the opening and tie it: and keep it there for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he will urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area may prevent it from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because, in those who are born with it, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: therefore, he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the penis upward with his hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	He cannot procreate because the sperm cannot reach the matrix properly: and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of the operation is to have the patient lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the rod with your left hand strongly, and cut the head of the rod from the priapi place, with a sharp point or an acute scalpel: like the cutting of a reed, or as you root something, so that its middle comes similar to the head of the rod: and so that a hole falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be careful during your operation from blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it what stops the blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding Albather, which occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adhering.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albathers often occur on the penis, and they are protrusions of ugly flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from them, some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, if it is not malignant, you should suspend it with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after that with diaphrynion ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the Albather is malignant and of ugly color, then you should apply a cautery to it after its incision and treatment.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however Albather is on the foreskin of a captive, not circumcised, and there is part of Albather within the foreskin, and part of it outside: then you must remove the Albather which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then care for the outer part: because when you care for both at once, the foreskin does not heal without being pushed forward.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And it also happens that in the testicles and foreskin there is blackening and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must scoop out all that is already blackened, and what is about to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on it after that honey which has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate rind and crushed sieve herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however a blood flow occurs, then apply the cautery with a crescent-shaped cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is beneficial for two conditions simultaneously, namely for blood flow and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed entirely in an hour: then you must insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In cases where the foreskin adheres to the head of the penis, and this adherence does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision: and sometimes it happens due to a wound or an abscess: therefore you must scrape it with a blunt spatula until the bond is loosened and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the rod, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Which is because the foreskin when it is thin, perhaps is pierced quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin from the head of the rod with a fine linen cloth that has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Regarding the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, by our will, and its use is properly for children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and a lighter way leading to healing.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is because I have found the majority of surgeons and phlebotomists to use cleansing by circumcision with a lancet and scissors: and they use cauterization, binding with thread, and incision with a scalpel.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed, I have already tested all these methods and have not found a better one than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in the cleansing with the knife, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains: thus it is necessary to make another incision to cut the other, causing future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing which is done by alfecti, that is, awls, which tailors use, the end of the male member is not cut: because it might enter its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with the hoof, perhaps the iron slips and ruins your operation: and the skin of a boy is short by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not require cleansing: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, the cleansing with scissors and tying with thread has proven to be a good experiment for me: because the scissors are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you press your hand, the two sharp edges are aligned, and they cut according to a single operation at one time: and a compression of similar shape is made, holding the skin of the rod from all sides, with which there is no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of the operation is to make the boy understand, especially if he is one of those who comprehend quickly, that you do nothing but tie a thread on his rod: and leave him until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you, according to what his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated: and conceal the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to his rod, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the rod comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from the filth that collects on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked area with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie below it temporarily with a second bandage.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower bandage firmly, and cut between the two bandages.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin up quickly, and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and above the powder a cloth in which is spread the yolk of an egg boiled in rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until the next day: and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and inclined: so that the branch of the nail does not protrude: and let the length of the two sharp edges be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error occurring in cleaning is: because the inner skin may entirely or partially escape at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you must extend it with your fingernail from the area before the formation of an abscess: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If three days have passed and what is under the nail remains swollen, having formed an abscess: then leave it until the hot abscess settles, and remove the scab with ease, and cut it according to how it is prepared for you: and beware of the tip of the nail.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treat it with what consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have discussed in the chapter on powders: and if it is cut beyond measure through the skin and extends to deeper areas, it will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treat it with what we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Regarding the extraction of retained urethral fluid in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to obstruction caused by a stone, or coagulated blood, or pus, or generated flesh, and similar things from those methods of treatment we mentioned in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not resolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone already present in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for the patient to be bent over on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the sick person hold his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, it is drawn with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: hence the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not resolved by what we have said and the condition is severely affecting the sick person: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be fine, smooth, hollow like the tube of a bird's feather in fineness comparable to a ray, long to the length of one and a half palms: it should have a fine tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of urine exiting through it is to take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is any excess wool, but insert it into the tube forcibly, like an alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter, and egg white: and have the sick person sit on a seat, and inject the bladder, and its rod with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the rod easily until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and let the sick person feel that it has already reached the empty space: and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage through which it goes is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For Vrina will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw it, and make Vrina run through the urine passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is evacuated, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of bladder irrigation with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is compressed within it, and you wish to distill water and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is, sealed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave area, in which is placed that which pushes, should be according to the size that fits it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, moisture is attracted: and when it is pushed, it is expelled far away: as a clepsydra does, from which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which pushes upward, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into a rod, according to what we have narrated in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the moisture with that which pushes it, for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a subtle clyster with which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass, whose head should be higher and similar to a small alcamah, and below it there should be a groove in which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram and put the moisture in it with which you want to cleanse the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two grooves with a strong ligature and double thread: and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the clyster into a tube, then press your hand over the bladder with a proper tightness along with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then assemble the circle as you would assemble a sibling: after you place in it what you wish from moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed the classification of stone types and its treatment with medicines: and I have mentioned the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of it all: and I have spoken of the stone on which manual operation and incision is performed: and this is the stone properly generated in the bladder: and that which is embedded in the penis: and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the stone generated in the bladder most often affects children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs is that urine exits the bladder similar to water in its fineness: and white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, and labors with it, and hangs down frequently.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing is easy for children up until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young adults it is moderate, being between the two extremes: and the larger the stone, the easier the treatment: and if small, the treatment is conversely more difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we arrive at the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with aclyster that will expel all the feces in their intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken with his feet and shaken, and moved downward: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or jump from a height several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his hips, so that the bladder may be entirely inclined downward.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with the oil of your left hand if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a full adult: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone until it stands under your finger: and gradually turn it toward the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it outward toward the location where you wish to make the incision: and command one attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant to lift the testicles upward with his right hand: and with the other hand, to move away the skin that is under the testicles from the site of the incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sharp spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find the area between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the left side of the buttocks: and make the incision over the stone, with your finger in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the outer part of the incision is wider and the inner part narrower, according to the amount that the exit of the Stone from it should not be larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger compresses the stone at the site of the cut, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone which has angles and edges, its exit is made difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for the one that has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then you must be ingenious with it: either grasp it with forceps properly, the end of which is like a crescent, which grasps over the stone and does not slip away from it; or insert under it a delicate instrument with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot grasp it thus, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything from the blood overpowers you, cut it with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however there is more than one stone, then first push the larger one towards the bladder opening.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then incise over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push the smaller one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then it is unskilled to cut it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the patient one of two things, either that he dies, or there is a continuous dripping of urine; because the place does not heal entirely.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer the expulsion of it until it comes out: or extract pieces of it from the fracture with scissors until you have removed it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place upon it cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot pus may be set.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you loosen it, moisten the area with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot pus and corroded substances and things like them happen in the wound: such as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prohibited by it: and it is known from the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert therefore your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and treat it with whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the entire course of treatment to bind the two thighs together for the purpose of the medicines that are placed on the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is in the channel of the penis, and it is fixed there, and the passage of urine is prevented: then treat it as I describe before you reach the stage of cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will be spared from cutting through this treatment, for I have already proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you take the perforator from alum iron, whose form is this, with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a string and tie it to the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the penis with ease until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to penetrate it until you make it go through the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks apart and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a string below the stone and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the penis between the two strings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder: and another binding above, unless when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for this reason you must do this when you tie the upper thread, so that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns at the completion of your work, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however a stone should occur in any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, that you do not find a woman who will expose herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or among those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you do not find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the manual procedure.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes to do that, then it is necessary to take a woman physician, well skilled: and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste and subtle physician, and present a well-educated midwife in women's matters, or a woman who understands part of this art: therefore make her present, and especially entrust to her to do everything you instruct regarding the examination for the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, he should see if the woman is a virgin: then he must insert his finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If he finds it, he should press it with his finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he finds the stone, then he must gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downward with all his strength until he reaches the root of the hip with it.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should incise above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the root of the hip, on whichever side the stone is felt: and his finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing under it; and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert a probe above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he should increase the incision according to the amount proportional to how the stone exits from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among these, there is a small one and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its types, so that it may be indicated to you by this regarding what you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood overcomes you, then apply ground zegi to the area and keep it for one hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and do so that you prepare with you of the instruments which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, to help you through them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with linen in a suitable binding: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood is calmed after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the incision of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Watery ramex is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in the sifac album, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is named sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own little pouch, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg until it is rotten: which is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the sifac album, which we mentioned: and that does not occur except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramix is from the weakness that befalls the testicles: therefore this material is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For its color either tends towards yellow, or it is blood red, or foul black, or it is water white, and that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if there is in the white scrotum that we mentioned, then the abscess is round in length somewhat like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own small pouch, then the abscess is round like a part of an egg, and because of this, a person thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it becomes noticeable.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square probe, whose form has been mentioned previously.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to what appears after the insertion of the probe, judge about what is inside it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to advise the patient to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left, and command the servant to sit at his right, who extends the rod to one of the two sides of the scrotal skin, and to the mirach part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take the broad lancet and cut the scrotal skin lengthwise through the middle, nearly to the pecten: and let the incision be made according to a straight equidistant line which divides the scrotal skin until it reaches the white sifac covering: and peel it away, and beware from this so that you do not cut it: and let your peeling be on the part which hangs more with the egg: and carefully examine with the peeling as much as is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the water-filled sifac with a wide puncture, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the scrotal skin that encloses: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its entirety or piece by piece, especially the thin side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, safety is not achieved in its incision, lest the water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If the egg protrudes outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find an egg corrupted by other blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels which are the suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and extract the egg: then care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water has gathered in two parts, then know that there are two branches: cut the other part accordingly as you did in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it appears to you that the operation is one, then do as follows: afterwards clean the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and the abdomen: and put on top doubled cloths, and they are poultices: and bind them with a bandage that has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken, and sweated, and filled with crushed la na according to this likeness: and the ends by which it is pressed should be made of chamois or wet wool: and they should be gathered together with a binder at the waistband of the breeches: and one end should cover from the anus up to the back, and the second end should cover towards the hip area: and the two ends above on both thighs below, and the other two ends over the two groins, and the whole binder should be gathered together at the waistband of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this ramex is treated artificially with a cautery instead of incision with an iron: and it is as follows, take a delicate knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is ignited, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing water is revealed: then take the cautery according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is assimilated to the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that knife, and ignite it until all the moisture escapes.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the knife with hooks, and scar it with a fine ignited cautery, and cut it as much as you can until you root out all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful with the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is safer, farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however something opposes you at the time of incision, or at the time of cauterization, such as a warm aposteme, or blood flow, or something else: then you must treat what opposes you from that with a cure suitable to it, according to what has been stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is timid and does not endure this operation due to its horror: then administer the piercing as I describe it, and proceed.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the significations that the flux is watery: then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the aposteme on its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the piercing according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the area, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may flow out: then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the obstruction is to the flow of water at the time when you pierce it: and this is not due to anything other than that the white membrane causes an obstruction at the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of the water: then it is necessary to insert a quill into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsy patients is extracted, whose form has been mentioned previously: or add in the operation of the wound temporarily.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it therefore accumulates, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will spend his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy ramus.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the cutting of this ramus, there is great fear leading to peril in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is salvaging from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the procedure on it and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body parts from which the testicles are composed: and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or sharp excess that is discharged toward the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from percussion.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and it has no feeling.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of the arteries and their swelling: as has already been mentioned: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is among them from the swelling of the arteries is recognized by the condition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which occurs from the swelling of the veins does not disperse anything when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section may be made on this type and on the other flesh: and it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upward, and extract it with a white suture: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory ligament after you free it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If the egg is consolidated with those flesh parts that have grown, then you must pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something of the suture, or in what is between the vessels: then you must free that entire adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If there is flesh growth in the area of adhesion which is behind: then you must cut all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of shoots, which is done with vines.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Witis is a hidden swelling wrapped in a certain folding, similar to a botr, with a softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the patient, as well as walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which preceded and was remembered.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, we must say the treatment for it according to what the first practitioners did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that you should have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels that are close to the stem: and another assistant should hold them and stretch them forcefully.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make a transverse cut with a broad and sharp spatula directly across the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove the outer layer from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then insert a needle with double thread into them, and tie it at the first location where Witis occurs: and tie it again at the last location.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and extract what gathers from corrupted feculent humidities.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If the Vine affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and does not waste away or dry out, and is not rendered useless by them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Regarding the treatment of intestinal branches.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this branching is from the incision that occurs in the extended sifach over the belly in the groin area from the mirach of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or jumping, or shouting, or lifting a heavy object, and similar actions.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal swelling towards the depths: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the cutting of the intestine, because it causes a sudden and intense pain at the beginning: and it is a different swelling appearing near under the skin: and that is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its course to the exterior intestine.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with the intestine twisted: and this is called Intestinal Ramex, and twisting: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes the feces enter the intestine and are retained there: and it is harmful to the patient: because it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this kind of illness with iron there is fear: therefore one must be careful of accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of the procedure is to instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the inner cavity, if it obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then lie him down on his back between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision according to what is needed to open the incision with them: and the incision should be of such quantity that it is possible for the egg to come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then remove the outer layer of the sifak and what is under the skin of the testicles until the white, hard sifak is revealed on all sides: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, between the white sifak that is under the egg's skin, and between the second sifak, and loosen with it the adhesion that is at the back part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand the skin of the testicles towards the inside: and with this extend the white saph with the left hand upwards: and raise the egg with the saph to the part of the incision: and command the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you release the adhesion, which is at the back after complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white saph.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything of it: then push it downwards towards the abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with thick thread, made linen from ten threads: and insert it at the last saph, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some in the shape of a cross: and tie with them the white saph, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles tied very strongly, until none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot aposteme does not result from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, release from the saph that is under the skin of the testicles a quantity equal to the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely according to its roundness, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles where blood and pus flow: as we have described in what has been mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place on the wound: and apply the bandage which we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white swelling which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And remove the bandage, until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its falling off is delayed, then bathe it with warm water: and apply to it what we mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Regarding the windy ramus.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this windy ramus, I have not seen anyone who has dared to attempt its treatment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And at first, they said that it happens as we have mentioned in the ramus that is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to bind the vessels after cutting and easily apply something over them: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound as we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is only a little, and it returns at all times: but if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added to the swelling, until the intestines descend into the swelling.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the sifach is stretched: then it is softened, and the area becomes apstedematous and prominent.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as was previously narrated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back under your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the swollen and prominent area of the rupture with a horizontal incision, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then grasp the alsifak and what is under the skin until the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the probe and place it on the prominent area of the sifach, and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two prominent areas above the end of the probe from the sifach together with a suture; then remove the end of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifach at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal rami.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the stitches, clean it, and dress the wound until it is healed.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sifach contracts, and does not add to the prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them is also softened, and its appearance is marred.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it to make the patient lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture firmly.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of this, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in my book: and there is no need to mention it, except for two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be known by the doctor when asked about it: and so that he may know its treatment if it happens to someone.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit through them, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by making an incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by rubbing, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then ligate the suspensorium, and cut above all the egg with one cut, until when two eggs come out: then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave anything on them except a fine suture over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one done by rubbing: because rubbing may leave some part of the testicles, whereby the animal lacks desire for intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Regarding the treatment of hermaphrodites in two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter Seventy.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is of the male according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that there appears between the testicles, on the skin of the testicles, a figure resembling a female vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from that part on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one type, and it is the woman's womb above the comb like a man's small testicles entirely, protruding to the outside: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for the three types, two from men, and one type from women, is: because it is necessary to cut the excess flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type of men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the incision of tentigines, and protruding flesh in women's wounds.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Tentigo perhaps adds itself above the natural part, until it becomes disfigured and its appearance is丑陋：有时在某些女性中它会增大到像男性一样扩散，甚至影响交配。 
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you must hold the excess of the flap with your hand or with a hook, and cut; and do not delay in cutting, especially at the deep root: so that blood flow does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh arising is the flesh that grows at the opening of the womb until it fills it; and it may extend outward in the likeness of a tail; and because of this, some first call the ailment tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we must cut it as we cut the flap, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of alraatica, which is an unperforated female ulcer.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alraatica is an unperforated female ulcer, or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental alraatica results from a preceding ailment: it may occur due to added flesh growth, or if fine or thick; and it can form either in the depth of the womb, on its sides, on its upper part, or lower part: it prevents intercourse and conception, childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its diagnosis is made by the obstetrician's observation if the obstruction is clearly apparent.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the swelling is from a fine boil and it is close to the two lips: then hurry and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is that you place small particles on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force until the fine boil is broken and the swelling is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and the woman should apply it every day so that the area does not heal in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the boil is large and thick: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the swelling is from flesh grown, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense compounded with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a large lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it for several days: and apply lint from dry linen, then treat with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh growths arise in the matrix: therefore, they must be cut according to this method: for it is not a cancerous abscess; no opposition should be made with iron at all for a cancerous abscess that is in the matrix.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, and red botches in the pudenda of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are the opening of vein orifices, from which much blood flows continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become old, they turn into tumors: and I have already spoken about their types and signs: and here I will say which of them can be cured, and which cannot.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say that hemorrhoids which are at the opening of the womb and are not apparent to the senses: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those among them that are at the opening of the womb and which can be sensed are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to put the woman in a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the hemorrhoids with scissors, or with a coarse cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powders of caustics without biting: such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, oak galls, and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut with it, it is good: and if not, make suction blisters adhere to his back without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossae, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, agaricus, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess rests, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth red is similar to the heads of alhaasse, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you must cut what appears from it, according to what I said in thethlil equally: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the perforation of the uterus that occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many types of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already spoken of all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is among those abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess at the beginning is sharp with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it reddening: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its puncture: and treat it with what aids maturity, until when the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to have the woman sit on a seat that slopes down two seats, and recline, or lie on her back, and bring her feet together towards the lower part of her abdomen: and let her thighs be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side and administer the instrument with which the womb's opening is dilated.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form appears in those that follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you insert with the sound the depth of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and injures the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary to place small pieces on the covering of the womb's depth: so that the entire entry of the instrument is prevented from entering into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary to set the spiral that runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and for the assistant to turn the spiral until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Therefore, when the exit is apparent and is touched by hand and is soft and tender: then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	Therefore, when the pus is drained, then you must place on the wound a linen soaked in rose oil: or green oil, which has some astringency: and place the linen, and remove the incision deeply in the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the matrix, and on the comb clean wool soaked in water, in which sloes have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and the wound are cleansed by being irrigated with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Teaching on Obstetrics, how live embryos should be treated that have been expelled in an unnatural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXIV.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the natural form of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From its signs, therefore, it is that when you see a woman compressed in the lower parts, and she desires to breathe in air, and is relieved by what is on her from the labor, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, with the afterbirth following it: or hanging, or dangling from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that his belly be compressed so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those excesses by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and one of its feet or hand; or its head and hand come out; or the umbilical region comes out: and it may turn around its neck, and similar unpraiseworthy configurations.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be wise and subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every configuration among them, and how the method is in it, and what it signifies, and to stand by it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus exits on its head by its natural exit, and it becomes violent for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is now weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and fumigate her womb with boiled fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the obstetrician should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and open the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until what is inside in moisture comes out: and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct him to be compressed after the enema: and make her sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, you must gradually and easily return them.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey at the entry, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet up: then shake the seat on the ground: and the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus: and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it equally: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The embryo exits on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus exits on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and gradually extend it.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out up to the thighs, then instruct her to be compressed, and make her sneeze with condisi: for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then gradually return the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented with all that we have mentioned: then take from the mucilage of orache, and oil of sesamin, and gum dissolved: and pound all in a mortar well: then anoint with it the womb of the woman, and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she achieves hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a sieve of myrrh: and place it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she holds the sieve for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and hold her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her belly with a gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits in this manner, then she will gradually bear the insertion of her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie back on her neck, and let her feet hang down below: and she should be lying on the bed, and clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows until she is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondrium gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper regions.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should insert his hand and gradually align the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging transversely from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Skill will be required in the reduction of his hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment that you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If labor begins for her, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then attend to the reduction of the hand, and align the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to compress herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its neck, with hands spread out, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually revolve it and align it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is aligned, then place on its mouth what we have mentioned made from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	Therefore, when you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to hold it in: and make her sneeze when you apply it.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the matrix in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your nail until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and causes death.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inside until you place it as is proper: and command the woman to compress herself several times: for it will come out with a slight effort.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is beyond nature, and they do not live at all: and a single afterbirth contains them, although they multiply, separated by a membrane, distinguishing the tied umbilical cord of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they exit like a single fetus does in a natural, easy birth: and they exit in an unhonorable manner, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach what we have said about unnatural forms, then treat them as we narrated: and let it be by a subtle midwife, and she does what is done with ease and slowness, and adapts according to every form with what is prepared for her, guided by skill leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember what is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has already been verified by me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be known by the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps she may encounter something similar to that; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division on medication, and it does not exit, and you are compelled to use manual operation, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound health, and is not affected by any of the conditions from which loss is feared for her: then the woman must be placed on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised: and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the matrix with wet oils mixed with marshmallow, and fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek with it the place where she can fix the hooks into the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin, or into its collarbone, or into places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is feetfirst, then into its hips and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curvature between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should fix another hook opposite it, or a third one if needed: so that the contraction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal tension, and not only in a straight line, but it should be moved in all directions to ease its exit: as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that in the area between those parts, the tension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If any part is retained, then it is necessary for the midwife to anoint certain fingers with oil and insert them so as to turn with them what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then change the hooks to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out first and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then it is necessary for a cloth to be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until it comes out entirely, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow: and thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus's head is large, or it encounters constriction upon exit, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary to insert a spathile with spikes between the fingers, and split open the head with it, and draw out the water: or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly do if the fetus has a large head, then it is necessary to cut with an algengematu: or extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then attract the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head comes out and is constricted at the forking point: then it should be split open until the moisture in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become unentangled and does not obey the exit: then cut the head piece by piece, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there are abscesses in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then you must pierce it until the fluid flows out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its orientation towards the maternal canal is simple.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted at the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth which you wrap over your hand, and cut open the belly or chest until what is inside flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the other limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the maternal canal is open, then she should insert her hand deeply into the womb and seek with it the head, and pull it with her fingers until the head reaches the opening of the womb: then insert one hook or two hooks into it, and pull it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the maternal canal is constricted due to a warm abscess that has occurred in it, then one should not labor over it. Instead, one should administer a flow of moist and fatty substances, and apply plasters, and sit in waters that soften and moisturize.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible for it to be aligned: then administer what we have said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do that, then it should be cut piece by piece and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood should occur, then bathe in astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I indeed have seen a woman whose belly contained a dead fetus; then she conceived another one over it; afterwards, another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in his navel, and it swelled until it opened, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called therefore for his treatment, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I therefore applied to it some strongly attracting plasters: and the bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after some days had passed, another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed at this, since there should not be bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, with the woman being in better condition: and she has lived thus for a long time, and discharges only a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not establish this foreign matter here unless there is knowledge in it, and assistance for what the skilled physician administers by hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Tightener, with which books are bound, having two equal ends at the extremities of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this end should be finer than the tightener: and it should be made either of ebony or of buxus wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of the entire wood be almost two fingers: and the margin of each of both is almost one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed in both, whose length is a half palm and a little more: and the width of each is almost two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two ends.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the end by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or buxus wood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there should be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging down, and with what is between her legs exposed.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two connected additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish from the opening of the womb's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another vertigo which the ancients called the form of the impeller, by which the fetus is propelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles a forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made elongated, like forceps in this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which has saw-like teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the artisan, the quicker they are for their operation, and they are more esteemed among people because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not disdain any of them so that an instrument may be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Regarding the extraction of the afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then you must instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with condisi: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it exits through this method, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the cover. Place herbs that open the matrix os in it, such as reed, rue, dill, chamomile, savine, lign aloes, and centaury. Take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's cover, and put the other end in the os of the matrix: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will exit with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If it remains after this treatment and does not exit: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert into the wound, and seek with it the second.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he finds it, then let him take it and stretch it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep in the womb, then let him insert his hand as we have described, until he finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line so that the womb does not fall due to forceful pulling: rather it must be shifted with ease to the right and left sides; then increase the amount of pulling.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it obeys then, and is preserved, and escapes from adhering.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already mentioned: treat it with sneezing and with the medication of a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then beware lest you fatigue yourself with repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, you tie to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse her with an ointment of tetrapharmacum.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will腐烂它几天后，溶解并排出。(Note: The translation was supposed to be in English, the last part was mistakenly translated into Chinese. Here is the correct English translation.)
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However when it becomes putrid, a bad smell rises to the stomach and head, and it harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of mustard and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument used for fumigating a woman in cases of retained afterbirth and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a vessel like alcama, or from horn: and the wider end should be placed over the fire: and the fumigation should be placed on the coals: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat with another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with anunas that are not perforated, which can be opened with a fine probe.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should perforate it with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula: and she should be careful not to touch the nerve.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear it may close again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it also happens that the anus is blocked due to the healing of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then it should be treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are Nodulation and Swelling which happen near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one Fistula or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodulation becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture or thin pus runs out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what exits with excrement and flatulence, when the patient has a bowel movement: and perhaps worms may exit from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And among these are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating as far as the bladder, and as far as the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And among these are those that penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the coccyx.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From which it is known that a penetrating fistula reaches the anus, and differs from a non-penetrating one, is to insert your index finger into the anus: and to insert a thin probe made of air, or iron, into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a thin thread of lead or a hair from horses' mane until you feel the thread or hair with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it thoroughly, and nothing comes out of the opening from discharge, nor gas, nor worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hurry to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urine passage: then its indication is the discharge of urine from it, and the prevention of consolidation of the area with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone: then the sign of this is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twist up to the bone: and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that treatment is not effective, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity for him, by foolish doctors, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a scalpel: according to what I narrate to you, and I have already tested: and it is that the patient lies on their back under your hands: and lift their legs up above their hips, and their hips should be inclined towards their abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a thread of lead or brass if there is a twist in the fistula until you know where the thread reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however he feels it weak around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel the thread has already penetrated by itself through the detected area, besides what you feel between your finger and the surface or the flesh: then therefore you know certainly that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor over it, for its healing is not possible, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that the flesh is healed in some men and from the treatment in which hope of help lies is to ignite a fine cauterium according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it ignited into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do this again twice or three times until you know that all those additional filtered flesh parts, which are like the hollow tubes of a bird's feather, have been burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out: then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the thread comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick veil of flesh or membrane between it and the thread: and you see the fistula following the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the thread that is in the fistula until the incision reaches where the end of the thread is, and the thread is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh pieces which resemble a bird's feather tube so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If the blood overcomes you and separates you from your operation so that you cut those flesh: then it is better and quicker to heal by cauterizing it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cautery with fire brings good properties, the burning of those added flesh, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, or crushed fat, until the place emits pus, and those burned flesh come out with the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, producing hard flesh: and there are medicines that have astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached deep into the anus, and extends from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tent, and between you and it there is a veil of sinew or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that place unless according to the way of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which means that one of the three methods is applied to it: either you cauterize it as we said: or you cut it until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint and apply treatment close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting so as not to cut the tendon containing the anus, and involuntary loss of stool occurs in the patient.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	For it may be healed: or you may remove the covering itself, and clean it after you cut it close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean the filtered flesh that is in the incision as far as you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and the fistula remains open on the inner part of the anus, and it will be milder for the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a tanner's needle, that is, of those who prepare hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together: and hold both tightly, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, hold it tight until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls off: then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not in you to do that because of the flap, so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the thorny spatula with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	About the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either inside the anus, resembling coal sacs or ember sacs, or they are like individual grape grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them there are small ones and large ones: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus are mostly lacking in moisture, from which yellow water or a little blood runs continuously: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is to instruct the patient to dilate: and to express until the anus protrudes, and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hang them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they do not hold the hooks, because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a coarse cloth, or with a mitten made of woolen material, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle on them after the cutting certain hot powders, to serve in place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not obey evacuation, then administer an enema to the patient that contains a slight irritant, so that it cleanses what is in the anus and obeys evacuation quickly when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the growths are external to the anus, then their treatment is light and easy: it is as you take them with your nail, or you take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who shrink from incision with iron, then it is necessary to administer their stitching according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the wrapped thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the growth upward, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wrap both ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and let them be horizontal: and bind the growth with a strong tie.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the athelil, and leave one of them untouched: do not heat it, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerote over the anus, and put it on the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the athelil fall, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Regarding the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from the dryness of the stool and the constriction of the bowel movement.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become old and medicine does not heal them, then it is necessary to scrape with the edge of a scalpel or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the outer layer that prevents them from healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not heal, then scrape them more vigorously than before until they bleed heavily, and remove the outer layer; then care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Regarding the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and dry athelil, and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain occurs from them while walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, what is around the nail should be cut and held with scissors or with a hook and pulled out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been precedented in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the dry athelil there is a small prominence, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment is to stretch the athelil and cut it, or tie it with silk thread, or with hair until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the athelil are eradicated, both inverted and not inverted with the instrument that I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	The formica is also a small, filtered, thick prominence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold encounters it, it feels like an ant bite, and it occurs throughout the whole body: and it mostly happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather: and place that tube over the formica until the circle of the tube contains parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the formica: and place it deep into the flesh, and pull out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a tube of brass or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn up high and wrapped around, so that its grip on the finger may be eased and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the Ant as mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Regarding the forms of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for relief of the bowels, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or brass, or cast metal, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those in which they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is used in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, their enemas should be so as well.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper head where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and it should have a distinct part where the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, very soft, tapering to fineness: and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little thicker, and the bag in which the medicines are placed should be made of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the shape of a small asofrati: whose base is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes as it is turned, and let the space that is between every hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made of raw silk, which should be composed of ten threads, or about that number, and join it with the skin like asofrati.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When the skin is placed on it, it should be tied tightly around the head of the enema between two distinguishing constrictions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle and the holes depicted here with the skin.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of administering the enema with it is as follows: fill the skin or bladder with medicine that is warmed according to the quantity tolerated by the patient: and beware that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards: and place under them a mat, that is, skin or cloth on which people lie, or a linen sheet.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the administrator should take the skin with both hands simultaneously, and squeeze it vigorously until all that is in the enema is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine drives him to an end, then let it hold as much as it can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with her the entire night, it is more ultimate in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you give him an enema for intestinal ailments, and its effect is swift: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and gentle, such as those with which children are given enemas.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a fine enema for which the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Regarding the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division regarding the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I will now speak here of their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the instrument by which they are inflicted and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are caused are often various, such as being hit by a stone, or cut by a sword or dagger, or struck with a lance, wood, or arrow, and similar objects from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that are inflicted according to the parts of the body are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or spleen: and similar ones from other limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the treatments of some wounds, so that I may set forth that reasoning and rule on other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the mention of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider if it is from the throw of a stone or similar objects, and has only broken the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear an unfavorable outcome of hot abscess: then hurry and immediately perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein: and do not delay this: and withdraw blood according to the strength of the patient: if there is nothing prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if little blood is coming out from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be performed on the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of excess, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however something prohibits bloodletting, then let the diet be reduced, and let no meat or wine be approached.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply to the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, lint infused in rose oil alone, or with wine that has astringent properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are certain there will be no hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not been altered by air, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if it has already been altered by air, then apply some ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or from a sword cut, and the like: and its edges do not come together with small pins, then bring them together with stitches, as I will narrate concerning wounds of the belly regarding their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound is already separated from the bone, and hangs loose, and there is no retention of it except with a small sling: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh instead of skin, and advise the patient to nourish themselves with foods that are thickening, such as heads, and cooked wheat until it is like porridge: and things similar to these.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out all the putrefied part and discard it: then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medications, then apply pressure on the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find it uncut, then cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands that what we have said cannot be accomplished, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light: so that you may sprinkle this powder on them: for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Flesh-forming Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: grind the whole much, and sieve it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it well, until it adheres to it well, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it with bandages from above, and leave it, and do not loosen it as long as it remains, so that it does not become swollen.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes the lime alone does it, when you do not have oil and dragon's blood at hand; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation on many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If the air has already altered them in some way, especially when it is summer, then this powder's intention is not effective: so care for it with what we have said, placing some digestive ointments on them; or put on them poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound and it is small, then extract it with a probe: and I will now speak of the treatment for fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Regarding wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment, and for a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it except to treat it with something that causes strong styptic effect, such as ziniar, and zegi, and things similar to these.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you shall not apply anything cold at all to the wound: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the noblest part of the members: and let that with which it is cured be mild from medicines, such as lime washed several times with sweet water mixed with oil, or with rose oil, and turpeth mineral, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply sutures: or bind its edges with compresses.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth, or a sinus has formed in its lower part where pus has already collected, then puncture it at the most depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood has started: then separate or cut it and ligate it: or cauterize it if the necessity calls for it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the windpipe or its entirety has been cut, but the alae nasi are saved: then approximate the skin edges with sutures over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, rather level it and reduce it to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a proper bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what does not prepare, leave it until the wound putrefies, and it separates and its discharge is alleviated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder I mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with the method mentioned in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Regarding the wound on spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a stab from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If wind or gas exits the wound when the patient breathes on it, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not have depth and is fresh with its blood, then do not apply powder to it right away or bind it, so that blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart, killing the patient: instead, apply a drawing ointment to it and unbind it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If ointment is not available, then place an old piece of wool on the wound's opening to absorb what comes out from its moisture: and have the patient lie down on the wound so that what accumulates in it can flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If however three days have passed since the wound, or more, and spasms do not occur to the patient, nor bad palpitations of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see his other conditions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treat it therefore with rue and other treatments until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If however its healing is hindered, and it is now always open, then know that it has become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treat it therefore according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what precedes regarding suturing, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	And if it has already made an impression on the bone and fragments have broken off: then examine the wound and quickly remove those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for their extraction is eased then.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment in the treatment of other wounds occurring in other limbs is the same as what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	About wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the abdomen is major, medium, and minor.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Sometimes therefore the intestine or a number of intestines protrudes from the large one.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their insertion and their suture are more forceful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small rupture becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not promptly return them to their place immediately: because they inflate, open up, and swell: hence their entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, the moderate rupture is better: because with it, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in those two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are used for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are specifically used for the other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more specific for the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with an explanation and description.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then this is because of one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said: or because there is swelling in the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	Therefore, when it is thus, then you must warm it, so that you soak a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water squills, and cyperus, and spike, and bind with it the intestine until the swelling dissolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes he makes it with wine in which there is astringency: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the swelling has already dissolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallows have been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that means its entrance is alleviated with a small object.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, the return of it occurs after this treatment, then find and cut slightly in the area of disruption with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared than cutting; and there should be no compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the end should be fine but not as delicate as a spatula, rather somewhat blunt: and it is that which resembles a probe, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound enlarges and enters the intestine, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its proper place if possible: for that is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary to have the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which there is a wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus you should apply it to large wounds and medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, apply it according to how it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that a faithful attendant is present at your side, who will hold the entire disruption with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover it for the one who follows the suture, piece by piece: and this is the method of a common suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is such that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's size.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave a quantity of one finger's width from the end of the disruption, that is, the doctor's: and insert one needle with thread at both ends of the skin, passing through the sifac which is under the skin from the inside, until it penetrates from the other side, and you have now brought together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the sifac: and there are four layers.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a proper approximation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave the thickness of another finger, and insert another needle into it: then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with what you need from the linen until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium thickness between thick and thin: for very thin needles cut the flesh quickly: and thick ones have difficulty entering the skin: therefore they must be of medium thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not appropriate for the needle to be fixed at both ends of the skin that are very close: so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and they are not stretched even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the tips of the needles so they do not harm the patient during their sleep: and place small pieces of cloth from clothes on all sides to hold the tips of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one needle, or two, or about that number is sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is to join the four ends together: two ends of the skin and two ends of the sifac alternately, with a needle on which is wound thread equal in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side where you started, so that the thread falls back from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the suture of cloth by which cloths are drawn together, and place between each suture the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I treated the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was more than one palm: and about two palms had come out from the middle intestine, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore replaced it after his intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound thus healed within about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived for many years afterward, in his usual condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any other medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed old dung on the wound twice a day, and continually washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now speak of two types of sutures according to the account of the discussion.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is to begin with a sharp suture: and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle penetrates the skin, and goes into the flesh according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave one end as you inserted the needle on the side where you introduced it, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer part on the opposite side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you make it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this at the same end of mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end of sifac which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate in the end of sifac at the mirach which is on its part, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin again from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from sifac on the other side, and pull the needle out from the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back to that skin, and sew the end of sifac which is on the other side with this end of mirach: and pull it out from the skin which is on its part, and do this alternately, one after another: and do this turn by turn until you sew all around according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the aim of this stitching is to sew the sutures of the skin flaps in such a way that you sew sifac alternately from one side of the skin end: and leave it alternately from the other side until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This his method is described so that you sew it according to the manner in which some of the physicians sew them, aggregating each part to its corresponding matching part by nature: and they apply one end of sifac to its other end, and one end of mirach to the other end of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must fix the needle at the end of the bandage nearest to you from the outer side, and make it penetrate to the inner side at that point only: and leave two ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner side at two ends of the suture, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inner to the outer side, at two ends of the bandage which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suturing is better than the common easy suturing, and it is the suturing that has been previously mentioned.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the teaching of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The abdominal suture is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which means you insert one thread into both: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from the part that is nearest to you, and make it penetrate all the way to the other side, according to the suturing of those who sew the skins evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then its suturing is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which means that when you encounter a fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it: and you reduce the intestine, and return it to its place, and adjust it: then apply pulverized incarnative over it.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound: then apply some ointments that are available to you until they cause pus to form: and let the threads fall out, and the sinews consolidate and heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would treat other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If the medicines are not available to you, then apply old dung immediately when it starts to emit pus: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medications in most cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you fear that the wound may spread to the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary to soak a soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and apply it around the areas between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse him with a styptic, black, warm wine enema: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and caused a discharge penetrating to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what comes from the small intestine is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine known as the Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is due to the abundance of its veins, and their size, and because of the fineness of its body, and its closeness to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however that which comes out from the wound is flesh, and you catch it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you equally reduce the intestines.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however the time has passed, and it has already turned green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has been darkened by it, so that blood flow does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in flesh there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pulling of it is eased for you, and its extraction in case of flesh detachment and pus discharge from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Reminder of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and it became a fistula, and excretions and flatulence came out from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied treatment until I was no longer confident in his healing: nor did I cease to care for him carefully until he was healed and the area was strengthened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the area already strengthened, I was concerned about the patient, that a bad accident might occur in his belly: and no such bad accident happened to him.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and having intercourse, and entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters have said that when a small wound occurs in the intestine, then it must be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is that you take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of the ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it bites on them and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to do this with each ant after the other according to the extent of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm befalls the patient thoroughly.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to suture the intestine even with a fine thread: which is cleaned from the intestine of an animal, attached to the needle after it is inserted.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and clean it thoroughly.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread at its end tightly.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then replace it in the wound.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know, a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except for narrowing, and there is no healing of it at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know, that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and aged, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly emits pus, and does not cease: then it is universally called a Fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we name it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And the Fistula indeed is according to truth a hardened, white, filtered knot: with which there is no pain, and it has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some name it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And at certain times it is moist, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and at other times it is scarce: and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division when I said wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, and in which flesh does not grow, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of them is either due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or due to the bad quality of it; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material discharged from it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its cure is unsuitable; or because the corruption falling in the region is a type of pestilence, or due to the characteristic of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where the digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed there; or because it has one bone or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zukens, which is done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these are the Fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or spine: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the compound joints: such as the hand, and foot: and from these are those that go to the proximity of the principal member, and similars.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, among these Fistulas, those that occur in this manner are of difficult healing and do not accept treatment, and dealing with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If there is any Fistula whose depth does not reach the places I mentioned: and you hope and have confidence in its cure, and wish to understand it, then take a probe of metal or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is a winding in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the softness of its body, is lightened and curved around the winding.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate on it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, choose one opening from its openings for enema.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you perform the enema goes towards the other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully investigate in whatever way is possible for you: to know whether there is an opening or a nerve, and whether the Fistula's cavity is far or near: or whether it is one Fistula with many openings, and stand over all of this with the utmost strength of your inquiry, with your questioning of the patient, and by finding pain upon pressing with your hand on the area, and similar indications and causes leading to the formation of an abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you have stood at all those true stations, then proceed to the cure with confidence: and this is to consider whether the Fistula is a near one that appears, or in a safe place far from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you about: then cut the Fistula as mentioned in my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which grows at its opening from the flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the Fistula is of deep length and is straight: then it is necessary to cut it deeply as much as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply licinia wrapped in sharp medicines: and insert it until the concavity of the fistula you grasped with iron: do this several times with it, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have mentioned.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you: then seek it out, and cut it according to what I have told you: unless something prevents you from doing so by a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore the bone is revealed to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what causes flesh to grow on it until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before: then you know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Reveal it again, and carefully examine it and cleanse it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, there is no ingenuity for you in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, pull it out with subtle scissors that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something from the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then apply something to the wound that will cause it to rot: and leave it until what surrounds those bones from flesh and humors putrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Rather, apply to it, if you fear, tow soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or tow soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors putrefy and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is alleviated, and their extraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the bone of the hip, and similar to these, and what is corrupted in it is a large part: then scrape it with the finest scraper until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw through it, and cut it entirely until the place where the corruption reaches: then treat it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a story that happened to a man in his leg: that you may set it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a man of about thirty years of age, to whom pain occurred in his leg, caused by something moving within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the leg and formed a large abscess: and he did not have an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time was wasted with the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and a great deal of matter came out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were formed in it: all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, he was treated by a multitude of physicians for about two years, and there was no skilled hand in the art until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matter flowing from those openings in great abundance: moreover, the whole body of the man had already wasted away, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to connect with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hurried therefore, and cut above one of those orifices, until I exposed part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and had putrefied, and was perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I sawed therefore what was revealed to me and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I cut away so that there would be nothing in the bone except that corruption which I severed and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long period.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried and exposed above the second bone beyond the first exposure: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I exposed it again and did not cease to cut the bone bit by bit, and attempted its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut about one palm from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except due to the disposition of the patient's weakness, and the lack of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: for he was fainting at all times from an excess of evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore healed completely: and hard flesh formed in place of the bone, and his condition improved within himself, and his strength returned: and he moved about freely in his movements: and walking did not cause him any harm at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however a protruding bone in an already fractured part of the body: then it is necessary to sew it up according to this method: and it is as follows: take a bandage, and tie it at the end of the protruding bone: and command someone to pull it upwards: and place another thicker woolen bandage over the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone: and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downwards: and you cover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone appropriately: for when you do this, it does not prevent cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary for the sawing to be on the corrupted area temporarily, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it should not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel another to take its place in锯ing. 
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and it is not prominent, but rather its part is continuous with another part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first side where there is corruption, until the sawing continues to the other side: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption for a while, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues to the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no method but scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the carpal bones of the hand or in the tarsal bones of the foot: then the case is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it, and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever method seems right to you: when the Vein or Nerve does not contradict you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the knives and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their fineness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare every kind of instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you shall know that these operations signify to you regarding the type of instrument you need when you have a long study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony of the methods of illnesses: then you will find by yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments for every sickness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will use as examples on which you will cut, and the test by which you will experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the Saw depicted should be properly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper part be an arch, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be a properly made pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of the Joint Scraper.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this Scraper be according to the form of a star-nail head: and its points should be according to the form of the points of elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the heads of the joints are scraped with it when they are corrupted, or if the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the Larger Scraper.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the Medium Scraper.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The method of shaving the side.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The method of shaving where there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The method of another subtle shaving.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The method of shaving the curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The method of shaving a small, subtle tendon.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The method of shaving with which the bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The method also of the great shaving.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the end is like a saw: it is used in many places according to the reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The method of shaving that is suitable for the reason of what is perforated in the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from ivory.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, all the things we have mentioned should be made from razors, and cutters, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the cutting of extremities, and锯骨。请注意，最后一个词“Serratura ossium”更准确的翻译应为“sawing of bones”，但由于指令要求严格按字面翻译且不允许添加任何解释或注释，我在此使用了中文“锯骨”以直接对应原文的意思。如果需要完全遵循英文翻译的指令，正确的翻译应该是：“Regarding the cutting of extremities, and sawing of bones.”
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medical treatment and the treatment does not help: and you see the corruption spreading to the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary to cut off that limb until where the corruption follows, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a worse evil than the loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of one who suffers from this is that the limb turns black until it rots: as if fire has burned it, or it becomes rotten after turning black: until that rot spreads to the adjacent part of the limb and creeps throughout the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Hasten therefore with the incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures: such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and centipede, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	Therefore, if the corruption or sting is at the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread further to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly, if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the wrist, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades further, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption spreads and you see it around the elbow: then the patient is near death.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond this in treatment is an excess of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do for the foot, when the corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints: and if it takes hold of the instep, then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the corruption has already come above the knee, then there is no skill in it, unless by amputation, and to leave the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting off or sawing the limb is to tie a bandage below where you wish to cut: and bind another bandage above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant stretch one bandage towards the lower parts: and let the assistant stretch another bandage upwards above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two bandages with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place linen cloth on all sides, and the saw should not touch the healthy area: and that the patient does not suffer additional injury and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If there is an internal flow of blood while you are operating, then cauterize the area quickly: or apply some powders that stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happened is that a blackening occurred on his foot, with a burning相似于火的燃烧：而且那种腐烂最初发生在他的脚趾上，直到开始影响整个脚。  
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man cut himself, after he saw corruption occurring in his member with its swelling, which he found due to pain and burning; and he cut it at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in his index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to recover that excess by applying medicines to his hand after cleansing his body: but the excess did not subside, and it began to spread to another finger; until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called upon me to amputate his hand: and I refused, hoping to succeed in reducing that excess: and I also feared his death from the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was at stake.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and I heard from him that he quickly cut off his entire hand: and was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought this account except to be of help regarding what falls under this kind of illness: and to provide guidance by which it may be understood, and according to which action should be taken.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the treatment of sinuses, and the nature of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is inside comes out as pus, and a vacant place remains like a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has become thin: and it does not reach its final stage of corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not named a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is named a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care is to cut all that skin as it turns: and especially when it becomes thin, and made like cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	And if you hope that the skin adheres, and does not result from that final corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then care for it with aclyster: and it is to consider towards the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus emitted from it is of foul odor: then cleanse it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, equal parts received, gathered in a vessel: and decocted over fire, until the medicine turns red: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it: and tie its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the duration of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressing: do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is cleansed with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you: and it is to take the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then boil it, and cleanse with it until you trust that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor ashes water, then cleanse it with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar is already mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse it with honey and wine mixed together, for it is the property of honey to purify and wash clean: and wine makes the sin adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this several times and are confident that the sinus corruption has been removed: then cleanse it with something that promotes flesh growth.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is such that you take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or cleanse it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the sinus orifice is narrow, through which a clyster tube cannot fit: then widen it with an iron temporarily: or place lint wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment on it until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then bring the edges together with a suture: and leave enough space for the clyster to enter without adding more.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated towards the upper part: then cut it at a lower place within it, so that the pus runs down from it: for when pus is confined at the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from生成在其中。请注意，翻译已按照要求完成，但在最后部分使用了中文结束，这可能是由于理解或处理上的失误。正确的英文结尾应该是这样的：
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around below it as you wish: then try to prepare the limb with a preparation by which pus may flow from it easily as it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure that no pus at all is retained in it: and take consolidating medicines which are applied to the sign, suitable for what you desire.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it covers the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with the scissors directly at the opening of the sinus hole, enlarging the sinus opening slightly.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread a mild ointment over another cloth according to the size of the hole: and place it on it away from the sinus opening, so that the discharge of pus from it is alleviated: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days at once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	The one who is over the sinus opening is the one whom you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may come out: and to know whether what runs out of it is a lot or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, again examine the site of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is a pus pocket in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is extended thus, and you see the material that comes out over the sinus opening, then you know that the sinus has adhered or is approaching adhesion: then dissolve it in the morning or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, a fine virus exits from the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are those among people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, an undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then you know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged, then add to the drying of medicines, but let the doctors make the medications moist in their substance and dry in their effect: such as diaphrynicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the latest method of treatment, it is to take diaphrynicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and spray old wine equal in its substance over it.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind it with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does a similar action to this when you do not have diaphrynicon ointment, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: grind all of it, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread it over the cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with honey which you boiled until it thickened: and powder over it the spices, and place over it the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long birthwort is administered in it, and roots of the celestial lily, and it is a lily: and flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simples, or compounded, grind them, and sieve them: and powder over the honey which I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the Sinus is prolonged and is not healed by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistulas, according to what has been stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Regarding the treatment of panaritium and worn nails, and the incision added to the finger, and the cutting.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCII.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot: and it may also arise in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the condition is prolonged and neglected by its healer, and it becomes abscessed with a hot abscess: or it corrupts and emits pus until it erodes the root of the nail: and it may corrupt it entirely, and the corruption may reach the bone, until there is a foul odor: and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed: then you must cut with iron all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the tooth is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the growths of the nail already press on the flesh towards the inside, and begin to pierce it, and harm it: then you must place a fine silver wire under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut it with ease, and apply over what remains of the flesh from burning and corrosive medicines until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already set into the tooth, then you must cut out that tooth and extract it: for it will never heal as long as the corrupted tooth remains in place.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If the nail is injured by friction or impact, and severe pain follows, then you must bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatumilus using a horizontal section from top to view.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient through this, and it will result in additional flesh growing in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger added which is born in some men's hands, perhaps is all fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which is born in some knots of the finger does not move: and that which is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the section of that which is fleshy among them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which means you should cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of that which is born at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that which is born on the finger near the last knot, then you must cut through its flesh first with a circular incision down to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then file the bone with one of those files suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation that occurs in the fingers excessively often happens either from the birth of the person, that is, it is born with them, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar causes.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you must cut away that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them lint, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or place between them a thin lead plate until the site consolidates as is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Regarding the incision of Vitium.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Warts are twisted veins, thick, filled with melancholic humors which occur in many parts of the body: and they most frequently appear on the legs, especially on the legs of those who travel and labor, and bear burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, you should administer a shaking of the body from black bile several times with a strong shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is to cut them and draw out the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to elevate the vein and extract it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Bathe the leg first with hot water extensively until the thick, fecal-like blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a strap.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a broad incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then draw, that is, extract the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to bleed the patient from the top first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail all the way down: until the amount of blood you see is sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bandage it: and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and if it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The extraction of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him to the bath: or foment his leg with warm water until it turns red and the veins swell: or exercise him vigorously if a bath is not available, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin directly along the vein's length: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein on all sides until it appears to the sense: and it is at its appearance that you see it turn from red to a bluish color.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it a probe, until when it is raised and comes out from the skin: lift it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another cut near that cut with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then remove the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with probes as you did, and lift it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another cut, or multiple cuts, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it, and cut it with the final cut near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then draw it to the cut which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you draw it out from the upper cut, or higher than all the cuts, until when it comes out entirely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you for drawing out and raising: then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and draw it out: or insert under it a probe: and turn your hand to all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it, and great harm comes to the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you have drawn it out entirely: then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twisting which turns to the sides, and it is not straight as we said: then you must incise over it throughout all of its twisting, and the places of its turning.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it entirely: and be careful at your cut over it that you do not cut the vein or injure it: for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, keep your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Method of Treating a Vein Injury.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Method of the Blind Hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curve like other hooks, nor does it have a sharp end to avoid injuring the vein: and it is of thick flexibility, gentle: because if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness: rather, let it have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of a Vein from the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Al-Andalus and the land of Arabs, and in dry, warm lands, lacking moisture, that is, where no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And it may also be generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction which occurs under the skin, like the occurrence of snakes and worms within the body, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of this vein's event is that violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then make the place suppurate.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that place of suppuration, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore its end appears from it, then you must wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one-eighth of a drachm up to two drachms, and the knot itself; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap that in lead, and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends too much, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before it has fully exited.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and withdraws into the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until it comes out completely from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein, in some people, something comes out that is five palms and ten long.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has come to my attention that it emerged from a man who was twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If it is cut during your treatment, then insert a rod into its opening and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until all the material inside is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint, or on the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treat it therefore as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouina disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in some places among us Bouina disease: because it often occurs in cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and it is perceived during its movement from one limb to another, until it breaks through the skin wherever it breaks through, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and serpents, that is, earthworms, and roundworms occur in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its maliciousness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it moves through the body and rises to the head and reaches a place: then it may open up in that place and emerge, and destroy the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to treat it and extract it, then it is only done during its movement and when it becomes apparent to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to bind what is above him and what is below him with a strong binding ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and remove it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a heated cautery over the area until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the patient to purify their body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Regarding the section on the illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCIX.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs: then it changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have indeed seen it myself, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villas.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the rope-like vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw one inflation proceed with a bladder, like a worm proceeds, ascending to his shoulder faster than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain departed from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it revolved throughout his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I marveled at the speed of its transformation from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before that, I had not seen this disease with my own eyes in such a manner according to this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find the pain change from one member to another; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it to be anything other than that the woman was one of those who have a dry body with exposed veins; hence, this wind changing appears to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear in this manner in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	Therefore, when you wish to treat it and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until the compressed wind exits: and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your own eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with what expels wind, and relieves it with foul pills, and pills of serpentaria, and similars.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter Ninety-Six.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their types, and according to the places into which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is as follows: some have large points, and small ones: and concave, and deaf.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have barbs.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which fall according to the limbs into which they fall, are according to two methods.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from the principal concave limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these limbs, and the signs of death that I tell you about later become apparent to you, then you must avoid extracting the arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most conditions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the siphac which is above the brain are: for there occur from that violent sweating, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nose or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is impaired, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there comes out from the place of the wound a white moisture similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there exits from it something resembling a watery substance of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not exit on its own.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple: and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in an empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following that is the coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death surely follows.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales a great, deep breath: and seeks the drawing in of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the membrane that is in the chest: then it is near the ribs: and a great breath with intense pain, with a sigh, occurs: and all the shoulder limbs are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food exits from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it: something of feces exits from the wound, or pus, or intestine which is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine exits: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The other members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and forearm, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and thigh, and leg, and similar parts of the limbs are treated according to various methods: when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen regarding these arrows, so that you may use it for your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is that an arrow fell into a man's lacrimal of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I extracted it from her other side, beneath the fat of her ear: and she was healed, and no harm came to her eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could only reach a small part of its end, with which it adheres to its wood: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was healed, and no harmful accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one that has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I sewed over it between two fingers: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I carefully handled it until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I sewed over the arrow: and I worked on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no harmful accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years then it came out from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained within her; and none of its positions changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow fell into his face: and the wound healed, and it remained, not finding much pain: and many similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man who was one of the princes of the King, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had already turned slightly to the right side: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore for his treatment after the arrow fell for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found therefore the arrow wound very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I examined it therefore with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed found a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped therefore that it was that puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I treated the area with a plaster that had attracting and digesting properties, confident that the area would suppurate, and a sign of the arrow would appear to me so I could cut above it: and nothing happened in the area indicating that the arrow had reached its location.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I remained with the plaster on him for many days: and no incident occurred, and the wound healed in the meantime: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt the fine tip of the arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I applied that sharp medicine to the wound opening until the tip of the arrow became visibly apparent: and it took me with it a period of time about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had enlarged, and it became possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with methods of ingenuity, until one day I began on it with properly made forceps, according to how their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose does not restore itself.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it, and the wound was healed, and the sick person was made whole in health: and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the nature of extracting certain arrows: so that you may set it as a rule and meaning on that which was not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended in the narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares little with much: and with what is present over what is absent: and finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit the members in which they are fixed, except by two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place whence it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or to the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits where it entered is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey and exit at the time when it falls: then you must leave it for several days, until the flesh around it becomes putrid: and its attraction is lessened, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in the bone and does not obey you to exit, then leave it for several days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you to exit after days, then you must drill around the arrow in the bone itself on all sides with a fine awl until the area around the arrow is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already advanced into one of the brain's ventricles, and some of those symptoms which I mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from attracting the arrow and leave it until its condition stabilizes after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the brain, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is fixed only in the body of the bone and does not penetrate to the brain: and the patient remains for several days and none of those symptoms occur: then attempt the attraction and extraction of the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed very tightly and does not obey you for extraction then apply the trephine around the arrow as I told you then care for the place until it heals
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is already hidden in a part of the body and is concealed and hidden from perception then seek it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however you feel it then extract it with some instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then incise over it until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If it has ears by which it can be held, then free the flesh fixed to it from all sides with every ingenuity you can apply, and use various methods if you cannot release the flesh through the breaking of the ears and their twisting until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with scissors to all sides, until you make it come out: and do it subtly with the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot reach it at once, then leave it for several days until what is around it becomes putrefied.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then attempt it again: for the skin will be relieved If however the flow of blood opposes you, then apply what we have said about treatment in its chapter: and be careful not to injure a vein, or nerve, or tendon with your incision.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And apply your skill in every way that is possible for you to avoid the Arrow's hit: and do it with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when you pull out the Arrow, that the patient be according to the figure, according to which it was at the time of the Arrow's hit.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible for you to do that, then apply what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The Arrow which exits from the opposite part of the other side, or already proceeds from it somewhat to the exterior: or the tip of the Arrow makes a bulge through the sensation from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: cut therefore over it, and let the incision be according to the amount that forceps can take hold of it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the Arrow impresses on the bone and enlarges for itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days: then try it again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the shaft has broken off and you wish to apply pressure: then introduce a concave instrument to it, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow: then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then push it with the entering instrument into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is alleviated by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to concave all the flesh where the poison is: if it is possible for you to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow falls in the chest, or in the stomach, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of the incision of vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see it, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like irons: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many types are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow's magnitude, its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the deaf pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the deaf one like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow is alleviated, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of the pushing concave is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it is alleviated and its impact.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Cut therefore with each cutting cut.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If however there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is: then aim at the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom greatly agrees with this: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Regarding phlebotomy The veins under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that cephalic phlebotomy is for obstructions which are in the throat, and sickness of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are the broad and subtle types according to the width of the veins and their tightness. The form of the myrtle lancet is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave veins, full, protruding, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width and finer at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting of subtle veins that contain fine yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Regarding the bloodletting of Basilicae.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the Basilicae, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial for bloodletting.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from what follows the chest, and the abdomen: and it is suitable for the bloodletter to be cautious with this vein and be wary of it, for an artery lies beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If he errs, and adds to the pricking of the lancet, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary that he not pierce her with a bloodletting instrument; rather, he should cut with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then it is necessary that you distance yourself from it and switch to another, or seek some branch of it: or bloodlet at the arm's vein instead of it.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear, and cut it with the Anesil bloodletting instrument, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish for the bloodletting of it from the same place, then it is necessary before tightening the arm, to touch the area until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the area with a cauterizing agent, then bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the bloodletting instrument Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the incision does not fall away from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling at the place you marked with the cauterizing agent, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see the blood at the bloodletting site leap like a boy's urine, and it is fine, red blood, then you know that it is from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then hurry, and place your finger on it for a long moment, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is interrupted (for it is often interrupted), then bind the arm and release it: and let the patient avoid moving it: and let it be under wraps.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let it not be moved for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If the blood does not stop and overpowers you: and if there is no medicine present for you at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and the blood is stopped.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of the sycamore, and boil it: take one half, and apply it to the place of the vein's constriction with a bandage and poultices until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is stopped, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with those mentioned previously from the place of powders stopping the flow of blood: and the stopping of its blood is not difficult in many conditions, because of the small area of the wound, and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Regarding the phlebotomy of the Fuscae vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The benefit of phlebotomy of the Fuscae vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to be cautious about fear from its phlebotomy, for there is a nerve beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the phlebotomist adds pressure at the puncture and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in that area, healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be thoroughly healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	And if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and is not shown: then you must place your vein-opening where you open the vein, cut with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If there is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	About the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Opening the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And you must properly in this vein, if you wish, open it by piercing with an olive lancet or with a myrtle lancet: for it is safer than all other veins, for there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is suitable for you when opening veins, to avoid the head of the arm with the lancet and seek a softer spot: and it does no harm if it is not found on the first attempt, to repeat over it with the lancet several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may become apostematous in some men when it is not opened on the first attempt, but that aposteme does no harm in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	About the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The nature of bloodletting and its effects must be considered by you for its proper application.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Therefore, first of all, you must know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health, and its continuance, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And for bloodletting to be performed on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And let bloodletting be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let bloodletting be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed since daybreak.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting which is administered in illnesses does not have a fixed time: but when circumstances and necessity call for it, whether at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it should not be the case that children be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should seniors who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a mild enema, if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins do not attract putrid and harmful superfluities from the intestines during bloodletting to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	The patient should not be bled when he is surfeited, that is, suffering from nausea; nor when he is drunk, nor as he recovers from drunkenness, until those conditions are removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor the patient with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And caution should be taken not to bleed after an attack of colic, and vomiting, and flux of the bowels, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and anything that dissolves the power from the body or animate being.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prohibits it: or let him engage in some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his bleeding on the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and strive so that his chest may be evacuated that day from all harmful animal conditions: such as distress, anger, and fear: and from all bodily conditions, such as labor, pain, and excess, and those similar to these.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present at his seat things with which human custom runs due to their aromatics, and odors, and spices and similar things according to the extent of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bleeder sit on a cushion that is higher than the bleeding cushion: then let him draw out his arm and rub it twice or thrice with his own hand.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he ties the ligature with a strap, and wraps it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be moderate, for when the binding is unequal, whether by excess in the binding, then it impedes the flow of blood; or in looseness, then also it impedes the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding, it is necessary that the person to be bled should rub his hands together near the vein, until the veins swell and become apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomizer should cleanse the vein with a little oil, in the proper ancient manner.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left index finger on the vein at the site where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not escape and the puncture is accurate.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For there are veins that you find fleeing like a string during phlebotomy: and among them is one that is full of air: and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts under the instrument, and deceives the phlebotomist, and the instrument does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is constricted: therefore, the phlebotomist must be steady and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should put down the phlebotomy instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened with one attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it with another attempt nearby or above the same place quickly: provided the area does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it becomes abscessed or the patient swells, then leave it for a day or two days: and do not bind the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps heat will attract the abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Let him not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat phlebotomy if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood flows thinly: and you fear that the quantity of blood you wish will not exit: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same puncture straightly, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place is in many people a minor operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it is already abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure at all on it, for nothing excuses it to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from the dregs of oil on it, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies where you bleed veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and they do this with mithridate, alfarachi, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who has not been bled except that once, or if the vein opening is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated briefly, on the area: and bind it for an hour, for it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after several days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put something over it like dissolved aloes or myrrh: or something from the juice of menthastri, that is, calamus or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often enough swellings and protrusions occur around the phlebotomy at Basilicae.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place therefore your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that protrusion is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Be careful, then, to put something on it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps the blood of an artery may flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice for it with something that has astringency, so that the area may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to withdraw blood from every person according to the measure of their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the victorious color over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow until it turns red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it flow until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and requires blood extraction once, to enlarge the opening of the vein, and let the opening be on the side: and in one who is weak, it should be contrary to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in places, and that the opening be narrow: and better in bloodletting of the vein is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and nerve cutting: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting across the length and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for one who is accustomed to faint at bloodletting, it is necessary to eat slightly before bloodletting with bread infused in pomegranate juice or honey: or secaniabin, if it is heated: and extract from him blood in three places, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is of a chilled complexion, then let them take before bloodletting bread infused in honey syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause is a large loss of blood: then it is necessary for them to drink water with meat and subtle fragrant syrup: and use aromatics with algalia, and anoint their chest with it: and use the other things we mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Who wishes to bleed his arm and release his blood a second time: it is necessary for one whose bloodletting is for significant evacuation and whose strength is weak, to release blood gradually according to the amount of strength over consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to bleed his arm again, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it leans: it is necessary that he be bled on the second day or the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is already much heated blood, and it becomes sharp, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood be let from him once, and a large quantity be drawn from him: and the incision should be enlarged until syncope occurs: after you have been preserving all the conditions of bloodletting: and place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that when the bloodletter is ignorant, negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate when you want to bleed an arm again, and the vein's opening is already closed, and the blood's exit becomes difficult, to press on it violently, and to extend it quickly while bent.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad, indeed leave it until it is bled again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of a bloodletter what has coagulated from the blood at the vein's opening, and place something dissolved salt in water on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from theriac alfaroch, or sagzenea on it, and apply it with gentle pressure until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however the vein is already an abscess, then leave it uncovered and do not cover it until the abscess settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If the necessity provokes to release blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy at that same place or in another vein on the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the location of the Fuscae and Basilicae, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should insert his hand into warm water until the vein becomes red and appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be bound above it with a bandage with slight constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize across gradually, not widthwise, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize be at the joint of the hand for a moment.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is prevented, then dip the hand again into warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your purpose.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in the summer days, then you are excused from dipping the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And it is placed most importantly that the flow of blood into warm water occurs during the winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Indeed, the bloodletting of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its bloodletting is to bind the wrist with a bandage, or with your hand, after you have immersed it in warm water, until the vein swells and is very apparent to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then puncture it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to leave your hand with the lancet at the end.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Beneath it, the nerves of the fingers are exposed without flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot at the vein's opening and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Therefore, when you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, you should do this with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The bloodletting from the left hand is beneficial for spleen ailments: and similarly perform its bloodletting in the same manner as you did for the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the wombs, retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of bloodletting is such that the sick person should insert his foot into warm water: and make friction upon it until the veins swell: and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the veins is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and many branches branch out from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, bloodletting should be done in the larger branch of it, or near the heel at its gathering: for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you bloodlet from it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your bloodletting tool across where you bloodlet it, as if you want to cut it: and let the bloodletter be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is prevented, then dip his foot in warm water again: and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the bloodletter misses the vein on the first attempt, then repeat the bloodletting slightly higher up, for the area is safe, and you need not fear any harm from it when you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of its bloodletting is for the pain of gout, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his bloodletting is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to four digits above the heel with a fine long thread: for it does not appear unless because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then bloodlet from it according to whatever method is possible for you, or diagonally: and this is better, or cut it with an incision, or sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then bloodlet from one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, towards the little toe: and be careful of the nerves, and let as much blood flow as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place skin over the site of bloodletting, and bind the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning ventosation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventouses are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventosation is performed in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and extraction of blood: the other is ventosation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventosation which is without scarification is performed in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And for windy conditions which are treated with scarification and bloodletting, there are fourteen parts of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and windy Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and windiness of the chin, and it is below the jaw on the lower part of the mouth: and windiness of the two spatulas: and windiness of Alachosos at the end of the tail: and windiness of the two focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and windiness of the two thighs: and windiness of the two cavillarum.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And Ventosatio indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not fall from them, as is the case with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should ventosatio be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any diseases that arise from excess, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts ventosation due to illness or habit, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people for whom when blood multiplies in them to the point that they need its extraction through ventosation, they find heaviness and sodahan in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is he who finds swelling and redness on his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is he who finds itching on his face, and forehead, and darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is he who scrapes the place of his swelling.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells, and he spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month: then we prescribe that swelling be treated, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The remedy for swelling of the neck is: for it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be done after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this swelling is in place of cephalic bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permissible for one of a cold temperament to use it, or for one who has catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for that reason, the elderly should not use it, and those who have cold diseases in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But he who becomes accustomed to it is overcome by forgetfulness.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason, you should instruct the cupper to temporarily place his hand with the cup towards the lower parts, fearing the onset of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Cupping or Alkehel is in place of black bloodletting and general bloodletting, and for that reason it benefits asthma, constriction of breathing, windpipe splitting, cough, and congestion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to apply the cupping Alkehel temporarily, for if placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Cupping with alhagdahim benefits accidental pains in the head, opthalmia, migraines, piercings, and pain in the roots of teeth: and it is a substitute for general bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand with scarification so as not to hit an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Cupping under the chin benefits alcoholism in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: and it serves as a substitute for bloodletting from the veins in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Cupping of the spatulae benefits alchafacham, which occurs from obstruction and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Indeed, the blowing upon the interior parts of the two bellows brings benefit equivalent to the bloodletting from three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae: for it attracts blood from all those tiny veins which are in the flesh: and these tiny veins attract from other veins thicker than themselves, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you must instruct the Ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification: for the area is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventosa which is applied over the alchausos provides relief to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you must instruct the Ventosator to use a large ventosa, and let it be of air: for the area requires strong suction, and perhaps delicate Ventosae may break: and it should be scarified with a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The Ventosae of the legs noticeably reduce: for they attract blood from the whole body, and relieve old pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and help bothor and ademenul: and serve in place of bloodletting from two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body and cause syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of the Ventosae of alhorcobeni is similar to the benefit of the Ventosae of both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the placement of the Ventosae is to place the ventosa initially empty, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of the ventosae, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with an equal arrival: and do not stop iterating and continuing this until you see the area already redden and swell, and the redness of blood appears: then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of tender flesh and fine pores, you must scarify him once, not more: so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the bloodletter to enlarge the scarification and make it a little deep: and regulate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then you must scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first juice, the way is opened for the refinement of blood and its aqueous quality: and in the second, for the thorough extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very feculent, then let the scarification be done a third time: so as to achieve the ultimate.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually or for a short while, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish for the extraction of much blood, we scarify with multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it must be scarified with deep incisions: and the limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from oils at the site of bloodletting, and what the person being bled should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	For him whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, the areas for bloodletting should be anointed with opening, soothing, and resolving oils: if it is in the summertime, such as oil of alkeiri, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter time, then use narciss oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or balsam: and things like these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	And if the excess is thick and cold: then the oil should be rue oil, or balsamite oil, or dittany oil, or anise oil: and things like these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	And if the windiness is of large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit oil, and these places of windiness should be washed after windiness with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of solatri, or with water of cucumber, or with water of portulaca: and things like these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, should wash windiness with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and things like these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose excesses are thick, should wash his windiness with old wine, or with henbane water, or anise decoction, or chamomile: and things like these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be cautious about windiness in a bath, or near the bath, rather it should be administered after exiting the bath by one hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not advisable for someone to sleep after windiness.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that should regulate windiness or bloodletting before windiness.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary to first consider: then if the windiness or bloodletting is for a choleric person, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood: then it is necessary for him to take cooling things, such as pomegranate molasses: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and cyclamen, and rue: and things like these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his foods as chicks, and meats of sheep satebiget, and seasoned foods with herbs: and things similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for one whose complexion is cold, he must take in drink syrup of honey, or of almaua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take fragrant wine that is middle-aged, which is between old and new: and let it be ordered that he use sparingly of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food as chicks, and canebir: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and chicks of pigeons should be cooked with issia.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it must be that the drink on the day of bloodletting and phlebotomy be more than food: and it must be that in some men's drinks there is given at certain times theriac alfaroch, or medicine of musk, that is, muscata, or alesselite before bloodletting: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal limbs may be strengthened, and the blood made finer.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it should not be taken in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Regarding Windiness without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Windiness which is without scarification, is windiness that is placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gout, and upon the stomach, navel, and areas of the kidneys, and the anus: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought for, except for the transmission of blood from one member to another: as we place windiness upon the breasts in the illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to resolve cold invisible swelling in the limb: just as we place swollen on the stomach and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the limb, and heats it, and removes pain because it resolves that swelling.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed on the kidneys when obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by the power of its attraction, it perhaps opens the obstruction or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does the same when placed on the spleen and liver for swelling to be treated in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these swellings are treated empty with only incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleurisy illnesses: and this is done by filling the Ventosa with hot water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for the condition have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The method of applying the Ventosa with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the diameter of its opening be that of two spread fingers, according to how we have formed it: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side at a place which is about the middle of it, according to the size through which a needle can enter: it should be made of copper or brass, with thick, smooth, equal, clean edges: so that it does not harm the limb when placed upon it: and let there be a crossbar in the middle of it made of metal or iron where a candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this becomes large and inflated, larger than what we mentioned, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the flatus of children and those who are emaciated is different from that of men and those with thicker bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this inflated device over a limb with fire is to light wax with fire properly from linen, or a small candle from tallow: and place it on the middle crossbar which is in the middle of the inflated device: so that the fire ignites around the lower part of the inflated device, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed on the limb: and a finger should be over the hole I mentioned, until when we hold the inflated device: while we need to, remove the finger, and the vapor will escape through that hole, and the inflated device will deflate immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wax according to its manner, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the cupping device used for the illness of pleuresis with water, there is no crossbar, nor a hole: and it is not used except that it is filled with water and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping device, the larger it is, to hold more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Regarding the suspension of bloodletting devices.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not applied to many places, except where it is not possible to place cupping vessels on the limbs due to their small size, such as the lip, and gum, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare limb of flesh, such as the finger, and nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: to use leeches that are from sweet waters, clean from putrefactions.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be kept day and night in sweet water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be purged first with bloodletting and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the patient's limb until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them on it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	Therefore, when they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to suction the area with a cupping vessel, then it is most beneficial for treatment: and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with plenty of water, it should be rubbed and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the leeches fall off and it is seeping out, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the seepage stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood flows excessively, then powder and sprinkle ground zegi, or galls, and similar astringents over it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let halves of peeled beans be placed on the site: and leave them until the beans adhere in place, for the blood is congealed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the repetition of bloodletting is required, when possible, to change the places.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If bloodletting is prohibited due to suspense, then the area should be cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or pierce with a needle in the places until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed, for they adhere immediately when they sense some blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you want them to fall off, sprinkle something over them from ground aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A General Discourse on the Restoration, Dislocation, and Treatment of Torsion, and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This Chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractured and dislocated bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that foolish doctors and the common folk boast about this Chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book or read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is deprived from the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never entirely complied with that good thing, and did not attain from it what I attained except through the length of reading ancient books, and studying their understanding, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that my knowledge contains: and beyond what my experience has passed, after I have shortened it for you, and freed it from the burden of lengthiness, and shortened it to the end of abbreviation, and shown it to the end of deviation: and I formed many shapes in it from the forms of instruments which are used in it, since it is by the addition of deviation, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collections concerning the occurrence of bone fractures, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin the recollection of fractured members, and various ones, if of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	We must say in the prologue of this Chapter the summaries of the discourse and the chapters to whose understanding the artisan is first compelled to stand on their truth: that is, so that you and those who are quick may know or learn this noble art and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall happens to someone, then you must first hurry to bleed him and to relieve him, or both at the same time: unless something prohibits it, such as weakness of strength; or he to whom one of these things happened is a child or an aged infirm person; or it is a time of extreme heat or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and flesh of birds, and of kids: and prohibit wine, and thick meats, and being filled by foods and all food which fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are safe from a warm abscess, and do not fear the discharge of matter to the limb: then may the sick person return to his initial regimen with which his habituation has become accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, rich in nutrition, thick, heavy, which have viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and roots, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen, the fracture is healed faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their early old age, and the infirm, it is not possible for them to be healed and consolidated according to their natural way, because of the dryness of their limbs: and they are consolidated and continued which are at the end of softening, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue over the broken bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds itself, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary to provide the sick person's nourishment with foods that have heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you shall know that the species of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull bone: and the fracture of the chest bone is different from the fracture of the back bone: and similarly all other limbs exist different from each other: and I come with the recollection of every species of fracture exposed in its Chapter distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures also differ among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For its fracture is curved, besides which shards may occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture is along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splintered, that is, shards, and projections proceeding, as they are in a reed, when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture, a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each species has its own method or instrument for its restoration, according to which its recollection will come, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And by which the fracture of the bone is known, is its twisting and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor sound at your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient find great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is a twisting or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary to move it with hand and compression at all, but place upon it from the medicines of which its recollection comes, after the moment which befits the place: then bind with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you shall know that when the place is bent and split into two, apart from the pus that may occur in it, however, all parts are removed from their companion: then it is necessary for you to begin at your appointed time for its correction, equalizing it before a warm abscess befalls it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	And if a warm abscess occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the abscess rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whichever method can be done based on its mildness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you shall know that the restoration and equalization of it is easier than that of bone in which pus occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it according to how the memory of it will come to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If pus is in the bone, then the extension of this fractured member from its two parts is necessary, if it is a hand or foot: or with your hand if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with one rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the member on an equal ground according to its natural form, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended: then strive to restore those additions with all ingenuity and in whatever way you can to their places: and be careful according to your strength, lest excessive weakness result from your operation, neither pain nor injury: and strive according to your strength to apply one of the two bones with its companion according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time for you to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the extent of your skill.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware strong extension and forceful compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a warm abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation: as we have already seen many times from their procedures.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then apply after equalization, and proper treatment, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and advise the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware not to move it during his waking hours, and in his sleep regarding his turning, and stirring, and in his evacuation, and all his movements with his utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him be cautious that the position of the limb does not cause pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which means that when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb: then it is necessary to change it to another position where he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with it, so that its position is equal and straight: so that no distortion occurs in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the fractured limb is as I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs differ in their smallness, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those among them that are small, such as the arm, and finger, and toe, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of a soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which of them are thick, like the thigh and leg, must have a wide, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For the wide bandage connects the large limb and tightens it equally on all sides so that no spot enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your evacuation to apply a suitable liniment to that, on soft tow over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture with three or four layers, according to what the limb deserves: and hold your hand firmly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and hold less tightly than your previous tightening of the fractured site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away with the wrapping from the site of the fracture gradually, and loosen the tightness little by little until you reach a large part from the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip and wrap it again over the fractured area with layers.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then proceed with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightness of the wrapping and its loosening according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings with soft tow or cloth, with which the curvature of the fracture is evened if there is any curvature: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then apply the splints evenly over these wraps immediately, if there is no swelling or warm abscess in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or an abscess, then place on it something that will sit on the abscess and reduce the swelling; and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the splints over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the splints should be made from the halves of a broad, shaved, and wisely shaped cane; or they may be made from wood used for sieves, which is made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and the width of each splint, according to this form, should have the same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the traction be thicker and slightly wider than the other splints: and the length of the splint should be according to what is suitable for the member in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then wrap another strip over the splints according to the same tightness as the first one.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind it with strings appropriately, according to what we have said about tightness: and it is so that your binding over the site of the fracture is tighter: and the further it extends from the fracture, the looser the binding should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the strings be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the strings are thick, as I have seen in the work of foolish ones who use twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake: for the tightness with them falls outside the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads again do not suit: because you do not achieve with them what you want through tension.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be less than a finger's width between the stake and the stake.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the stakes after they are tightened at healthy sites: then place under them soft tow or carded wool until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and the skin is ruptured, I will come to it with a reminder of that in the second chapter by its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every fractured limb should be bound with stakes on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when the limb is large, you should not place stakes on it until after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the risk of hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients restored fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of a brief common plaster restoring fractures, suitable for most complexions, especially women and children: because it is such that heat does not overcome it nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is done by taking the millstone dust, which is the flour residue hanging on the walls of the mill near the motion of the millstone: and prepare it as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white: and place the mixture not too thick nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Method of another plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and torsions.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of all ʒ X myrrh, and aloes both ʒ V and alcohol ʒ XX are to be ground, sieved, and mixed with alcohol: or with egg white, if the complexion of the patient is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Method of another plaster which also benefits fractures and torsions.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, and fenugreek, and white hollyhock, of each ʒ X, myrrh, and aloes both ʒ V, acacia ʒ VI, Armenian bole ʒ XX. All are to be ground finely, sieved, mixed with water or egg white: and administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and to alleviate pain occurring in them, and bone裂纹和骨折。
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take suet wool and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil: and place it on the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no restorative power, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it properly relieves pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of the plaster which restores the broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig of the deaf, and the leaves of the wild poppy: and grind all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of the shortened plaster, applied for the restoration of the fractured bone: and when you want the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of althea, and chamomile, and flowers of violet, and flour of the herb, of all one part each: grind all, and prepare with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then prepare it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The method of another stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs at the restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of althea, and seeds of flax, and pomegranate flowers, and sweet clover, and marshmallow, and flowers of violet, and chamomile, of all one part each: grind all, and prepare with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	Use the whole according to the heat of the member, and the cooling of its temperature.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on the fractured limb during its restoration, except a plaster made of wax and oil: nothing else: and he described it to be a balance between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen thought that over the fractured limb during its restoration should be placed things which have a drying heat, such as myrrh, and aloe and frankincense, and similar to these of those which we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster that helps with the wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take myrrh, and chickpeas, and human hair that has been cut, or a bird's feather, and coltsfoot, and salt in equal parts: they are ground, sifted, and prepared: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity according to which it is necessary for the bandage to remain, and then be loosened, is such that you should consider whether there has not occurred to the patient pain, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there occurs to him a severe itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling in the place: then hurry and loosen it within an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet: and submerge it in warm water, and wash the area with it until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, on it: and bind it for one night, until you are sure there is no warm abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with a fine compression and a small plaster: and do not constrict it with your first binding, and use fine bindings until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all symptoms are now completely removed, and you need a plaster and binding, then do it again as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we have said has happened to the limb, then do not loosen it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, do all of that according to what appears to you from loosening the limb as we said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approximates over it: then add more in binding than your whole first binding: and also increase the infirm man's food according to his previous recollection of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the place of the fracture already drying out and becoming thinner than it should be: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So fumigate it with warm water every time you loosen it, and do this for all three days, and lighten the binding momentarily.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish restorers do with a fractured limb by some other means when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored with a twist, is an error from their operation, and it is a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said it in their books and acted upon it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of them in it at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Of the treatment of an accident to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fractures are diverse, and its shapes are many: and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture caused by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the saphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe affects wood: and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts through part of the bone, and cuts its surface, but the cut does not penetrate to the end of it: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, which means Absolute Elevation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a grinding or wearing down: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone like a hair's thickness: and it is a small crack, and because of this, this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among them is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the bone plate to extend into the interior, and a concavity is formed: just as happens to bellows of brass when they are struck and part of them extends inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And that happens very much in the heads of humid bones, as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And separate efforts are made for all these types of fractures, and I will come with a recollection of the whole of that in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures through examination of them, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of the corrupted flesh which is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary type is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, cleaned, and anointed on it with encaustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient: then if you see from the symptoms that it clearly indicates fear, such as choleric vomiting, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cessation of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar ones among the symptoms in most dispositions, undoubtedly it is not cured: and if you see symptoms that do not terrify you, and hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	Which means, if a wounded person comes to you when first wounded: and it is during the winter months, then it is necessary that you focus on the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all dispositions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer months, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the membrane becomes corrupted, and those symptoms we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with fragments, and traction: then it is necessary that you cut away the shattered and worn part, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is so that you should scrape the head of the wounded area: and expose over the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light over the injury.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the exposure of the bone there happens to be a flow of blood or a warm abscess: then apply what is necessary to it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is so that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with an instrument of a sharp edge: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another cutter after the first, somewhat wider than the previous one: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply another cutter even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is to have a number of different cutters with you: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are shorter than others: and they should be sharp at their ends, and they should be made of Indian iron or steel: and use them easily in striking over the bone, so that it does not shake the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong, hard: then you must pierce around it before you apply the cutting instruments with drills which are called non-deepening drills: and they are not so named unless because they do not penetrate the limit of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it: therefore, the drill has a round end above that which is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents submersion, and penetration through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a great number, each of which should be suitable to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill appropriate for every skull: the sharpness of whose ends in length and brevity should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of drills, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around the fractured bone is: to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place it so that there is the width of a radius or about that between every hole.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the cutting instruments what is between every hole from the bone: and make it finer than you can at the lighter end, as we have said, until you root out the bone, either by hand or with some other of the instruments you have prepared for this: such as forceps and fine chisels.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must be cautious with all care that the drill or cutting instrument does not touch anything from the sinew.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	Therefore, when you drill around the tooth and separate it from the gum, if it is connected to it, and you extract it, you must file it and even out the end that remains in the bone with another similar chisel-like instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thinner and finer than the other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If any small pieces of bone remain and cause trouble, then remove them easily with the instruments you have.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with licinis and the ointments we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen mentioned and praised highly: and this is his teaching.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you to begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is more severe and evident: until you expose that part and place under it the end of this lens-shaped chisel, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, being blunt, does not cut anything: and the sharp part of it running along the two sides in length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part rests against the gum, with its sharp face facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the chisel from one side with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it turns: and you shall be secure about the flap, that no accident will happen to it which you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medic were not stupider than others and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the flap in some places, he would cut it off with the end of the lens-shaped chisel and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the panniculus, and that which is severed from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine splinters remain in it: then you must scrape away that roughness, and root out those splinters with subtle rasps of various sizes which you have prepared, so that you may be able to use the most suitable and appropriate ones among them according to what the operation leads you to do, and the bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you must apply yourself with reason, whereby you first scrape the bone more widely with those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer one after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this continuously until you reach the point of using the finest and most subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small capillary fissures and fine fractures, you must apply care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that is not hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and who has stood over what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the panniculus detected is retained when you remove the bone: then you must take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it as light as you can on top of it, so that it is not too heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply over the broad ligament: and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are secure from warm abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and apply after it medications with which there is excessive dryness: such as lily roots, and flour of the herb, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to these: and it is that you make from these medications a powder, which is dusted over the wound like they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it all medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to irritate.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your ability, that the wound in your care is clear: nor should there be any ointment dirt or filth in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all: for when pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it corrupts and putrefies it, and great harm befalls the patient afterwards: and it often happens in scalp infections, when the bone is cleansed of it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if the patient experiences the symptoms we have mentioned, you shall know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then you must take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and wet the cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place him on a shiffin: afterwards care for him with the types of treatment which are appropriate, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that only the two upper parts of the nose are fractured simultaneously or one of them: because there are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not fracture, and what happens to it is only wear, distortion, and flattening.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert a small finger into the nostril and align that fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this should be done skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that your operation does not cause pain to the patient.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then it should be aligned using the end of a rod, which should have a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same: and hurry with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the inflammation has subsided.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a strip of linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part: or insert two strips if the fracture is in both parts: and let the strip have a thickness that fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancients said that quicksilver should be poured into butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That indeed does not seem right to me; rather, it should be poured into the curd of sheep's milk, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then apply the quicksilver until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of quicksilver, after being wrapped with a soft cloth; and it happens that it holds the nasal fracture very firmly, and does not prevent the patient from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, use quicksilver.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	And if the nose is affected again while you are treating a warm abscess, apply plasters to the nose with cerote, or with cuttlefish bone infused in rose oil, or a little dyaciton.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if a warm abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to apply plasters made with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with sheep's curd.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft piece of tow on it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the nose are fractured slightly or shattered, then it is necessary to incise over them and extract them with suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the incision and treat it with what promotes fleshing and strengthening, using appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose, then you must treat it with rushes: and administer a lead pipe until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not with a wound: then examine if the fracture is only on the outer side and is not broken into two, and is bent inward: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the patient: similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the prominence of the fracture from inside to the outside easily with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and straighten it with it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then you must apply extension from both sides, according to straightness: until it is possible to align it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, the teeth have already been shaken or broken: then bind those that you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver thread, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place wax over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a well-made large splint on top of the cloth: or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bandage it according to how its binding is prepared and its application suits, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest: and give him a diet of mild sorptions.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something has already changed in its appearance in some way: then hurry and treat it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and make a poultice of mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the scabs: and place soft wool on the poultice.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore, while that poultice remains on it and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it alone and do not remove it until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If during this time a hot abscess occurs, then apply what we have said many times for its reduction, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, take note.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a fragment is already separated from the bone or from the soft tissue: then be precise in this, to remove those fragments from the soft tissue using whatever instruments are suitable for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the wound opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount necessary for you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those soft tissues and nothing remains of them, sew the wound opening if it is large: and if not, apply a poultice suitable for it, and promote flesh growth until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Regarding the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The collarbone is mostly fractured from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is either broken and separated into two parts, besides which contusions may occur: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or it is such that contusions occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is such that there is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation for it when the fracture is without a wound is to have two assistants present, so that one of them holds an aid following the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form becomes as it should be: and there should not be any prominence or concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a sphere of cloth or wool under the patient's neck. The size should be according to your needs: and extend and lift the collarbone, and compress the sphere with your hand until you equalize the fracture as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has gone deep, then it is necessary to lay the patient on their back with their neck down. Place a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder and have an assistant press his shoulder downward until the end of the collarbone that is deep rises upward. Then correct and equalize the fracture with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the collarbone and it moves, then you must cut over it and remove the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then you must apply yourself to cutting it with one of the files which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone an instrument that preserves the skin; and it is an instrument made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that does not have a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length should also be according to what is possible for you in performing the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: one end should be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound which you made when you extracted the bone splinter is wide and threatens to become inflamed with warm swelling: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear warm swelling: then fill the wound with cloths and lint according to the amount of the wound's tear.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a warm swelling does occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the swelling.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A constriction of the bone when it is without a wound and without a cut is treated by placing on the bone a poultice made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft cloth over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place the ball under his scrotum, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the himematem, that is, the roll which the Saracens use, which should be very long: and its width should be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled poultice over the cloth and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a strip from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the strip in place of the himematem which falls over the fracture and area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the himematem over the fracture as wrapped, and wrap it around his neck, and under his healthy scrotum, and under his injured scrotum: and bring it back over all parts, and how you see that the binding holds the fracture with proper tightness: and this is what is not hidden from you, and all of it, so that the strip is not removed from over the broken end.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary to look after the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the bandage softens and you see that the strip can now be removed: then adjust it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's scrotum on his back, and put a small pillow under his scrotum at his side during the night, so that his support is lifted from beside him.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the furcula is raised by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Either bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, if no accident occurs from itching or an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see that it is needed.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the binding, and leave it until it is restored and healed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the furcula is bound and strengthened to the utmost within twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula is rarely fractured, and if fractured, it is at its wide part: and only the edges of it are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore that part is fractured, and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not recognizable except by touch: then according to the shape of the fracture attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore it to its natural shape by any means of skill that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then apply mill powder with egg white to the area, and a soft tow, and place a poultice made of doubled cloth over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place a wide strip from a thin board over it according to the size of the entire spatula, or slightly larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If however there is a concavity in some places of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with soft tow, until the needle descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with linen bandages, with appropriate constriction, and the firmness of the needle, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage is softened, tighten it, and equalize the needle if it is moved from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the bandage: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made of bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment protrudes from the bone and pricks under the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we have said in the case of a clavicle fracture from the settling of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured rib.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely occurs.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are often fractured and crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which inclines towards the lower parts, and there occurs intense pain to it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is evident in the broken bone, and not hidden from sense, Its restoration is for the sick person to lie supine on his back: and place between its spatulas his pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and bring the ribs together from both sides or sides with your hands: and adjust in its alignment, according to every way that it is possible and appropriate, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a plaster and tow, and place above a slender stick from willow board, or chalingi, and those similar in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust in binding it over the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage around to the back several times, and secure it with a proper tightness.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then examine the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if the necessity of it provokes its removal due to itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then hurry and remove it, and take off the plaster, and correct what happens according to the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then apply the plaster again if you see that it is necessary: and secure it with a bandage until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts following the back, and from their extremities on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And wear and tear does not affect them, unless because they are made of cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense during the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done by aligning the fracture with fingers as much as possible until the shape is even, as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters and bind the fractured ends with a splint, if it requires one.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs inclines towards the interior: then the patient suffers intense pain and puncturing, like the puncturing that occurs in one who has pleurisy: therefore, because the bone pierces the membrane, and also the patient suffers difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have devised many ingenious methods for this: among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach becomes inflamed, expands, and pushes the fracture towards the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, abstain from causing a quick formation of a hot abscess unless it occurs.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already occurred, then address it accordingly.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them have said: place something suction-like over the area, then suck it with strength, and it is similar in reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that it attracts windy excesses to the place because of the condition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in warm oil: and poultices should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled: so that the bandage is even when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a strong thing that the sick person cannot tolerate constrains them, and the cloth pierces the mouth with a damaging puncture, and we are concerned for the sick person: then it is necessary to cut above the place and expose from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place upon it the instrument that sews the lips, of which the description has preceded: and we cut the lip with ease, and incise it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If a hot abscess should occur in the meantime, then hurry and pour poultices into rose oil, and place them on the area: and treat the sick person with what is appropriate for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime, he should also lie on his side on which he sleeps until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Regarding the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter Ten.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The vertebrae of the neck are sometimes fractured, and rarely do they suffer from wear; similarly for the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not healed: then make your judgment.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that his hands are already softened, numb, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you know that he will not be healed, and is in a condition that is mortal in most cases.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them and feels the contraction with fingers and the pricking: then you know that the bone's function is intact, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar condition befalls the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened, and what happened to the hands happens to them as well: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion escape involuntarily: and when he is placed on his stomach, excretion escapes involuntarily: and when he is laid on his back and wishes to urinate but cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If however none of that happens to him, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is to endeavor the cooling of the inflammation: so that you place on the worn vertebra rose oil alone: or with eggs of a roasted hen.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place it on the same several times a day until the warm abscess is calmed; then place one of the strengthening, drying, and binding plasters on the area and bind it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let him not sleep on the side where he feels pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens near the worn bone or something that is already separated from it, then it is necessary to cut over the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some flesh-forming ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last bone of the tail is fractured and it is the end of the tail: then you must insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus and align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible, and perform the second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the area and remove it: and treat the wound with the preceding treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Regarding the restoration of the anchor.
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankles rarely fracture.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture is not complete but a comminution at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise and displaced inward: and the patient experiences pain and swelling in the area, and the leg that is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is that you extend your hand over it until you stand over the fracture how its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you by the equation until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is along the length, or already inclines towards the interior: then make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place a poultice on it: then place a splint of wood or of hide on it: and bind with a bandage on which you do not fear the displacement of the fracture nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of it with what fills it until it is taken by the bandage according to equality: and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a warm abscess happens to him: then cease from extending it and its restoration until the warm abscess is seated: and place on it what seats it, as precedes, then return to its restoration: and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, there is pus in the bone or it is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Regarding the restoration of the Adiutorius fracture.
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: to take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And let two bands be tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it should be suspended from an elevated place: and the patient should sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should throw his broken arm over the wood until it reaches the tip of it, where the bend of the wood is attached in the middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that it may stretch downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician equalizes the fracture with his hands simultaneously, until the fracture returns to its proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is to have the patient lie on their back: and suspend his arm from his neck with a band.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, so that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands: and the other holds below it, and each one extends to their respective part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with one band, and above it with another band: and each of the two assistants should extend them to their respective parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then it is necessary to place one band below the tip and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed on that place, and on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is equalized as it should be, and is applied with good alignment: then bind it, if a warm abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a warm abscess occurs, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess quiets: then bind it: and the method of binding it is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let the arm be bound with support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and bind the arm with support, so that the arm remains in its proper place: if nothing prohibits you from it, nor anything alters from the fractured bone on you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something from the fractured bone may alter on you, then use splints: and it is to place a splint over the fracture itself which should be wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of a finger between each splint: and the length of the splints should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints with the bandage as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding on the place of the fracture should be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is lengthened, the binding should be looser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the placement of the splints and the binding as we have said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if you fear a warm abscess, then remove the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then observe the binding for all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur, or food is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excess tightness of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, correct all of that according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the binding unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under the support a cushion filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And observe at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the fractured limb is not loosened or the binding softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, correct all of that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have mentioned, so that the food is light at first, until the wound begins to heal: then it is necessary to make his food more substantial.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is customary for the support and leg to be bound for forty days: therefore, it must be loosened, and a bath administered, and treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is ugly, ground down: then do not remove the bandage and splint until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the humerus.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger bone is fractured, or the smaller one: and perhaps both are fractured at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller bone is fractured above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower bone is fractured, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse it is when the two bones are fractured at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the small upper one, then it is fitting for the doctor in its restoration to apply a slight extension with ease, until it is straightened.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the large bone is the one that is fractured: then it is necessary to apply a much stronger binding.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the hand in a position during its restoration, and to extend it on a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be common to all the fingers or the rest: and the patient sitting squarely on himself, and let the pillow be before him, or directly in front of him, in height, so that the patient does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the minister extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister shall extend similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor equalizes the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fragments in the fractured bone, then endeavor to reduce every fragment to its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If there appears a separate piece of bone protruding and piercing the skin, and you have no hope for its restoration: then incise over it, and remove it according to the method we have described in the preceding.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on this, so take the treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If a warm abscess should occur at the beginning of your restoration, then line cloth with a plaster made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be neither too thick nor too thin: and bind the cloth tightly over it with a fine bandage until the abscess is calmed; then remove the plaster, and apply an ointment prepared from mill powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place the splints, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you shall know that the number of stars in the arm is six in most dispositions: whether the fracture be in one socket or in two sockets at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your binding over the site of the fracture stronger and more forceful, and somewhat more with the binding toward the upper part of the fracture, or towards the lower part of it: or place a milder binding for a while according to how the preceding recollection at the beginning of the chapter dictates.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft cloths, moist; and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be of flax, properly medium between fine and thick, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the binding after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if something happens which requires correction, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to foment the limb with warmed water until that itching ceases, and leave the limb unconstricted until it rests, then bind it again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	And if the binding has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and things like that: then correct all of it with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the binding, then it is necessary to soften it for a while and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of the things we have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to remove the binding unless after twenty days, or around this time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the patient's hand be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be steady, and protected by its strength from disturbing motions.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that depends on the dispositions of complexions and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Regarding the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures rarely occur in the knuckles of the hand and the joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, except through frequent attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore the fracture or attrition occurs to the palm, then it is necessary that the patient sit upright, and before him be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand extended on it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the assistant extend the fractured bones, and let the doctor align them until they are joined well together.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, if a warm abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint on top according to the length of the area: and you have now wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is near the lower part around the heel, then make something like a sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to bind it with his fractured foot: then wrap it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be made of leather, which should have softness, so that the leather may be applied with the body of the foot: and bind it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint on top, and another splint below on the foot: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the binding, as the hand is rotated: and extend between the toes with a band.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, align it according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the sole: and if you wish, place a straight, small splint on it: so that the fracture is raised, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle finger, and index, or little finger, and ring finger, then align it, and bind it with the healthy finger that follows it: or bind all according to continuity: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small splint on it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposal of a warm abscess: and oppose with what is necessary when something from it occurs, according to how its narrative is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of the fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured, and it is noticeable because it turns inward and backward.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that a band is applied above the fracture, and another band below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should lie on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the surgeon should stretch all the band to its part according to equality: and this is done when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then the band should be placed at the part of the pectineus muscle, so that the extension falls upward: and another band below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the band should be placed near the knee, so that the extension is downward.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor equalizes the bone with both of his hands until he restores it to its natural shape: and the bone is joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and binding, if swelling does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If swelling does occur: then leave it for several days until the warm swelling subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The binding should be done in this way.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You must wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, and fold it twice or three times, leaving some excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the thigh.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee to the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and hip what is excess from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip at the site of the fracture the splints, and put one of them over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that it equalizes the binding.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong binding from the middle above the site of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you extend with the bandage from the site of the fracture, let your binding be looser and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind therefore with both three splints which are on top.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower part until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both pull also the ends of the splints from the other side so that the binding does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then apply the binding over it while it remains, in such a way that no corrosion, abscess, swelling, or similar things occur to the member.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Hurry therefore with its solution, and correct everything that happens from it, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however there is a fragment in the bone that pierces from the bone: then it is necessary to equally remove it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find it and remove it: and treat it according to the preceding instructions until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this hip fracture is bound, besides adding splints to it, as we have said in the case of support and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus fractured, the patient does not suffer from limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides applying the other leg to it, then it is necessary that the one to whom it belongs limps always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but wear often happens to it.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If however a fracture does occur to it, then it is only either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with wound, and without wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over the whole with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that the parts which are torn are equalized with fingers until they aggregate and are joined as much as possible by equality and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a poultice of sesame flour, or from the mill, with egg white: and place a round splint on it if you need that: and bind it tightly with an appropriate bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments we have mentioned in other fractures: such as a warm abscess, and similar ones: so that you oppose every occurrence with what is appropriate to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the legs are two bones, of which one is thick and is named the name of the leg: and the other is slender, and is named Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fractures as it happens to the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured simultaneously, the leg turns in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the slender bone is fractured, the leg turns to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is fractured, you find it below: and it is one of those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equalization, and ligation of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a nasty fracture, having many septic signs: that there be less extension, and milder alleviation by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation for the arm: and it is that when you equalize the stars, and complete all your operation, then take two bands from pine wood, which is used in the fabrication of solariums which is placed under boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have small thickness, and let them not be from the thin ones: and their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee downward.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one two layers of cloth according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two bands at three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is prohibited, the leg deviates to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now a cradle of wood according to the length of the leg should be administered, and the leg should be placed in it, so that it keeps it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is very necessary that you do this in a fracture when it is accompanied by a proper wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with utmost diligence to remove abscesses, or swellings, or other such things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If any of those things happen, then apply to it what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter Eighteen.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A complete fracture does not occur in the heel.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Bones of the foot sometimes suffer a fracture, and toes rarely suffer a fracture as well; and in most cases, they only sustain a bruise.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones protruding above their normal position, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on what has protruded from those bones; then press or tread on it until it is aligned and returns to its proper place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a poultice and place some tow over it; and put a small board under the arch of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it to the foot with a suitable bandage after you wrap it with cloths and other necessary materials.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones aligned whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is on them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some fingers are fractured, then restore them, and equalize them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place the splint on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than that; then place under the foot the board I have told you about, and secure it with a proper binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is fractured of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on every finger a splint of its size, wrapped in a linen cloth: and secure the board at the lower part of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the bottom of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, so that you do not forget, to consider all that I have told you about other fractures from the accidents we mentioned: and address every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and a man's virga.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then tilt her to the side of her back slightly, and let her be held backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full: and let it be in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that exits the cotum until it becomes like a sphere in front of the Vulva's gate, and the broken mouth returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place the poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, remove the cotum with ease, then let her urinate: and reintroduce it in the manner you first inserted it; then return to her original poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or so, for the mouth itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her Vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the Vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with cotum and remain in place for several days, as we have mentioned, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the mouth of the Pectinis of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration and equalization what we have mentioned for the Anchae bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures that slightly affect it, especially in one who has some practice or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book greatly, for the fracture itself indicates to you the right way in its restoration and tightening in many dispositions: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the man's penis is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrapping of cloth on it and wrap it up, and leave it for three days, or around that time, and it will be healed if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractured bones when there is an injury.
Caput XX.	Chapter Twenty.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for one to whom a fracture with an injury has occurred, especially if it is severe, such as the hip bone or the scapula or similar, that you should hurry and bleed him immediately: if the conditions for bleeding are evident to you, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is bleeding, then you must hurry to treat it by dusting ground zegi over it: if you have nothing else available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it if an abscess has not occurred.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If an abscess does occur that is hot, then postpone the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause harmful complications to occur.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone protrudes above the skin: then you must try to reduce it and align it with your hands with ease and a slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If it cannot be extended and aligned with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason, it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of them according to the amount he needs for that part of the treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double under pressure on it during the time of the operation: and let it have a sharp end, which has an edge at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let the upper part of it be thickened from the middle of it down to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation to place its sharp curved end on the protruding bone end: and push it with it once, until the bone returns and is leveled by some alignment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, attempt to align the ends of the fracture closely together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of it are finely fractured and do not receive good hold by the instrument, then it is necessary to cut that bone end until the instrument can grasp it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all with what we have described, then cut it with one of the scalpels we mentioned that is suitable for it: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape what remains on the bone from roughness and small shards.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the patient finds after its reduction a very severe painful pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you provide great assistance to the patient when the restoration that you perform on the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak the cloth in black styptic wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And you shall not place wax on the wound, nor anything containing oil: so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply the splints at the completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound exposed: so that you cut with scissors a hole in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be cautious with all care, lest you compress the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For foolish doctors have often done this: and have caused either death, or corruption, or pus, that is, suppuration, to occur in their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your binding be gentle, mild, different from the binding of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is severe, or it is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad accidents we have mentioned might occur, and you find pain in the suspended area: then it should not be covered with splints.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make involutions from hard cloths at the site of the splinters, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply licinia, and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as the ointment tetrapharmacum, and those similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is appropriate for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every morning and evening until it becomes firm and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus may run to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass for the wound and it does not become firm, nor does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small bone growths there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those growths have separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those among them that are not separated, and prick the limb, and cause pain, attempt to cut them and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If gangrene or ecilten, that is, estiomenus, or some other form of corruption and putrefaction befalls the wound: then it is necessary to oppose each of them with what is appropriate to it according to the treatment previously described in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from which my speech must stand, and to whom you should present your mind when a bone is broken, and protrudes over the member, such as the hip bone, and thigh, and similar ones from large members, it is that you do not presume its attraction, for death often results from it, rather leave it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound if it seems right to you: and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Regarding the treatment of swelling in a fractured limb.
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs in the limb during the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near the joints: and the figure of the member is disfigured by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And it may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider if the swelling is recent: apply to it medications that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, tragacanth, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling with tow, and bind them tightly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then dissolve it, and repeat another, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the plate of lead appropriately.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the knot has already turned into a stone and is tight, and necessity urgently requires its removal: then find on it from its upper part, and cut off the protruding excess: or scrape it with some scrapers until it is removed: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Regarding the treatment when it is restored, and a subtle member remains afterwards, not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of the bone is restored, and a subtle, weak member remains afterwards: then this does not occur except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the excess of loosening and tying the ligaments not as it should be: or due to the excess of tightness of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the member: or due to the excess of application of unnecessary embrocation at an inappropriate time: or due to the lack of blood in the body of the patient and the weakness thereof.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for this is to feed the patient and make their body tender until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the limb: so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply frequent rubbing of it with warm water until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they heal crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter Twenty-Three.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that after the restoration and healing of a limb, there is crookedness, prominence of the fractured bone, or knotting, and the form of the member is marred by this, yet the limb is not hindered in its natural function: then you should not heed the advice of one who thinks the limb must be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed greatly disgraceful, leading to death or great fear, so as to be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to apply a warm water rub, in which softening herbs have been decocted, such as the leaves of althea, and its root, and melilot, and things similar to these.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a poultice should be made for it with a softening plaster, such as properly made dyachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of the root of althea, and mix it with chicken fat or sesamin oil: and apply a poultice with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Either take fat figs, and pound them with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines diminishing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is dissolved with frequent, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the limb should be administered to all parts at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the twisting has already preceded, and become strong, and turned into stone, and the necessity has been provoked for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that the upper part of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and what is superfluous from the knot or bone be cut with subtle chisels: and ease be administered to that with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Regarding the discussion on dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is prohibited from its motion, and the figure of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and injuries to the afflicted.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hurry to its restoration: do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the area becomes swollen, and possibly the reduction of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, during the swelling, it should not be moved or extended.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms and painful pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you must hurry to bleed the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it should be left until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the entire limb should be treated with what will be mentioned in its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even as it preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Regarding the treatment of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws rarely dislocate slightly.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are moved from their places slightly, and are softened for a while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely and entirely until they soften toward the chest, until the saliva of the patient runs out and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is slight, then it often returns to its proper position on its own with little intervention.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed there is a complete and total dislocation, then it is necessary that the reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and this is how it should be done, the assistant should hold the patient's head: and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert two of his thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he equalizes.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean his jaws and prepare them for eating on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should equalize the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at the same time: then administer fumigation with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy: do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are equalized, and the mouth of the patient is closed, and they do not soften: then place upon them cloths with plaster made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound with soft bands with ease.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on his back: and let his head stand between two pillows so that he does not move it to the right or left: nor should he attempt, or be forced to chew anything: rather, let his food be given by gentle sipping until the pain is removed, and the jaw is set: then let him eat what he wishes, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let not the operator work on the mouth's operation concerning eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers often result from this, and constant thirst: and perhaps the stomach of the patient may loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see that: then know that it is a loss, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates outward: and this is evident to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is for the patient to lie on their back and extend their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the area firmly with your palm, for it will return to its place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then apply a plaster and poultice over it and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The ends of the humerus that follow the elbow and are connected to it do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates at some time, then it is necessary to reduce and align it as we have said, and prepare it accordingly.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place over it a plaster, and powder, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same method the arm extremity is reduced when it is also displaced from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it dislocates toward the outer lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates toward the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And it may also dislocate toward the upper part of the humerus: and this rarely occurs.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate toward the back, because of the spur.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate toward the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it dislocates and protrudes most toward the lower outer part, especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it exits quickly in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely that it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And it may happen that some people suffer a blow or fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot swelling, and it is assumed because of this that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it until you stand upon its certainty, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when it is turned downward towards the armpit: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and below the armpit upon touching the head of the humerus it feels almost like an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all ways.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is to have the assistant raise the hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs below its armpit, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it below, for it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation first occurred: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and a massage that softens and soothes should be administered, such as when the roots of coltsfoot, fenugreek, and sweet clover are boiled in water, and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should lie on his back: and a sphere of wool, which is equal in softness and tightness, should be placed under his buttocks.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with force, and pull the patient's hand towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the head of the patient so it does not move downwards: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, return him according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on the side, and insert his shoulder under the buttocks of the patient: and lift his buttocks upwards until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should pull the patient's hand towards the lower part of his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	And if the patient is light: then it is necessary to suspend something else with him to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced by another method: and it is that a long piece of wood should be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the sleeve of a mortar: which should not be thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place under the patient, after soft cloths are put on top of the head of the wood, and let the patient stand along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand downwards from one side, and stretch his body from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If the reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width the amount of four fingers, and its thickness the amount of two fingers: which has a round head, so as to ease its entry into the deep wound, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be tied over the round head, so that the wood does not harm the weak area.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the wounded area of the patient, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood down to the lower parts: and the wood should be bound over the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder by its width, and the hand should be extended downward, and the rest of the body should be left suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint moves immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore, when its insertion is completed in whatever way possible, then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size made of wool under the wound.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense, and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is spread from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the wound with a suitable bandage: and wrap the bandage over the plaster from above: and attach his hand to his neck, and leave it, without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that the patient's food be reduced until the limb is strengthened: for it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then it should be enlarged after seven days, or five, and exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is firm and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If however the joint is dislocated frequently, due to moisture that affects it, or for another reason: then it is necessary to apply a cautery with three holes to it, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament loosens after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and binding are reapplied several times, and it still does not firm up, and falls off, and cannot lift itself upwards: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have either been cut, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the joint will never be set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction of a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and nipple, or towards the back, is performed with force and extension by hand: until it returns to place, and then the rest of the binding and care should be applied until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use a bath frequently until that heaviness is alleviated, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Regarding the treatment of the dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty as well: and it is dislocated in all directions, but particularly towards the front or the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is concave, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all other forms of dislocation, and involves more intense pain: and often death follows with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it, when it is one of those that can be reduced, is to extend his hand with two hands: and his arm should be spread out, and the physician's hands should be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with his thumbs simultaneously, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is to the front: then it is reduced by bending his hand with his own hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a very strong, powerful extension: and it is done by two assistants extending the arm: and two assistants should also hold it firmly so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated in all directions after a doubled long cloth or a wide bandage is wrapped over his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be one of those things which help in lubricating the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then push the joint with a forceful thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place on it a plaster that has astringency and drying with egg white: and bind it with a proper tight bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And suspend the arm from the patient's neck: and leave it for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is stabilized in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well secured, then apply the plaster again, and the bandage, and leave it for several days until it is secured.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however heaviness befalls it after the reduction of the joint, and the placement is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression, until it straightens, or place on the joint fat Euphorbia, that is, fat ewe's marrow.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bandaged, and leave it on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore he sweats, then friction the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on the same joint once, and twice, and thrice with each entry to the bath until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put cow dung on it, moist and heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is indeed softened and returns to its normal state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocation by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almahassem frequently dislocates the hand, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, for the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the reduction of its dislocation be swift at the time when it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed or a warm abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is to place the affected hand of Almahassem on a board, and have an assistant extend his hand; and the doctor should place his palm over the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it should be considered if the palm has already retreated to the belly of the hand: then the patient should place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation proceeds toward the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inward on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls over the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster soothing the swelling: and leave it, do not repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you put it back in place after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own curvature: and it does not harm the patient except that the hand becomes weak, and cannot grasp anything: then you know that the nerves are cut or worn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no remedy for it except to be treated with a cautery near the site of the injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not help it at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Therefore, when Almahassem does not return, then apply to it the plaster that we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound and left for five days: afterwards it should be loosened and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is impaired, and something serious occurs in it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times until it is softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Regarding the treatment of the displacement of fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When one of the fingers is dislocated to any side, or one of the fingers to the back of the palm, or its front: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the tip of the finger and suspend it toward the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him and stretch him until he is straight on his day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it will be night, bind him according to this account: and do not cease to loosen him during the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it is stretched.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same if the hand is dislocated towards the abdomen: bind it to that part and perform your first treatment on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Regarding the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that there is a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or many vertebrae are displaced from their places: then there is no treatment for it, because death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the excretion of the sick person exits without will, and they cannot hold it in: and often some of their limbs are weakened, or both of their legs, or both of their arms, or one of them: or a vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it often happens that they are displaced to all four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is displaced backward is called humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment, however, is to consider then, if the humpback occurred from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor any healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In those that occur from a fall, or blows, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken at length about the methods of treatment.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	But I have already abbreviated from that, which is little excused by its much due to my closeness to the intention: and in my explanation wherein I explained it, and formed its instrument in a different way from how they showed and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the hump that occurs on the front side, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured by them, except that which occurs on the back properly, with what I narrate: and it is that the patient should be extended on his face on an equal podium near a wall: and a wet straw should be spread under him, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood should be placed fixed in a socket in the ground at the end of the podium, near his head: and another piece of wood near his feet at the other end of the podium: and the assistant should hold the wood, and it should not be firmly fixed in the socket.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, strong bandage over the patient's head and under their armpits: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is by his head: and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligature above his thighs, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligatures, and tie them to another wooden piece that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let all the attendants pull the ligature to the wood part, and do not move the two pieces of wood from the places where they are fixed: however, they should not be firmly fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with force, until it returns; or place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then attach his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall of which we spoke that is near the patient, into which the end of the board can be inserted.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And pull firmly until the spine is constricted and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a device that is wrapped around with your hand: and it is such that you fix into the ground near the head of the patient at the end of the footrest two pieces of wood, whose length is one arm's length: and near his head at the end of the footrest two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length which is between all the wood should be one palm: and now make a hole in every place where the turn runs: and secure all the wood very much to the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round wood: and it is a turn where the ligament is rotated in two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is secured, whose length is one palm with that which rotates: and in two other pieces of wood is similarly that.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the bands which you have tightened on the chest of the patient to the turn which is at his head: and the bands which you have tightened on his legs to the turn which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each turn, who turns his hand with the leather strap with which the turn is rotated: and the doctor aligns the spine according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turn which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine returns and the place is aligned, then it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then apply tow.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place a strip of board over the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be the amount that covers the hump and extends over the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it should be bound with the band we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the patient use a subtle nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	And if there remains some prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and alleviate, along with the application of the plate we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is administered in that sheet of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there is a prominence at the last vertebra of the spine: and it is thought that by it there is dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it is not advisable to administer this medicine to him: for it may cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Regarding the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the ankle and the shoulder joint only suffer dislocation: they do not experience what happens to other joints due to slight displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of the ankle dislocates in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	It is because it dislocates towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it dislocates most towards the inside: and slightly towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for its dislocation towards the inside is as follows: when you align the healthy leg of the patient with the injured one, it appears longer: and his knee protrudes more than that of a healthy person, and the patient cannot bend his foot near the groin: and the area following the groin becomes inflamed with a warm swelling, because the head of the femur has now reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation outward has happened is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation forward has happened is that he extends the sound leg according to its fullness: however, he does not double it without pain which is in the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward on it: and his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and in walking there is a dropping of his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation backward has happened is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he double it before he doubles the groin: and his leg is even shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip bone is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this species of dislocation is to consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become ancient with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure in it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it should not be entirely presumed for him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case of one whose dislocation is recent, and it is from one of the four species of dislocation: then hasten to this, to rotate the joint, and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return, and will not require further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and have the leg extended from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above the leg over the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under the tendons.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind with a gentle bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the bandage with the other hand.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front part of the groin to the shoulder part, or from the back part to the dorsal part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all be at once, until the sick person is lifted with their body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every type to do what I will say about the proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its proper reduction when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the bandage over the root of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin area to a higher part of the body, toward the shoulder area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong minister take his arms, and press the thick part of the diseased thigh, and extend outward with a forceful stretch.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For it now returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If it slips out of your control and does not obey you for insertion with this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the sick person together with a strong yet gentle bandage over both heels and both knees: and let the length of each be four fingers from its counterpart: and let the sick leg be extended two fingers more than the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the patient be suspended over a beam in the house: and its length from the ground should be two arms' lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct a strong youth to support the head of the thigh: and let him be suspended with the patient another one: and let another youth push, supporting the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its return to the proper position, when it is dislocated outward, it is necessary that the patient lie on a raised platform, as we have described in the case of one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the band be tied above his diseased leg and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two pieces of wood should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed: on which wrapped wet cloths should be placed, so that it does not harm the patient: and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downward during the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let all the attendants pull on their respective parts, and the doctor equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it on the same board and press it as we have said in humpbacked cases, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the limb of the patient be extended quickly: and this is according to the same account on a platform: and the physician should place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should compress it with the other hand, and with that compression place it extended downwards to the knee area.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and he should be raised off the ground: rather he should be placed on a hard surface, as is necessary when his hip is dislocated outwardly, according to what we have said about lying on both hips: and it is on his face, with the ligaments extended: as we have said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board on the place to which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient can move his leg and stretch it without difficulty: then know that the limb has returned as required: then join the two hips, and apply a poultice, and bind with an imemati, that is, a wheel: so that the hip does not move in any part: and the patient should rest quietly for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and the poultice, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in standing, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore allow the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and plaster it, and tighten it according to your first tightening: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him walk slowly on both for several days until he is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the patient sit straight, so that he may extend his leg if he can over it, and press your back against his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then hold his knee with your palms, and place them straight across his knee on top of it between your fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply plasters to it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with wool for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the patient should not use walking for several days until healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If the reduction of it resists you, then administer strong extension with ligaments, the use of which was previously described in the treatment of ankylosis, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes displaced slightly, and sometimes dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is an easy reduction: it is to be extended with ease by hand and equalized until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary to make the patient sit straight: and let a strong attendant hold him firmly from the back part of his spine, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the site of the spur.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull his foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the sole of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have mentioned.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg on the third attempt, and you pull out the spur.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one attempt, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure on it: because it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If the reduction is prevented by what we have mentioned: then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and fix a stake in the ground very firmly, so that it falls between his thighs: and you now wrap a cloth over it, so that it does not harm the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the assistant should take hold of his thigh: afterwards the assistant should extend the other foot, either with his hands, or with a band that is tied above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the assistant should extend against the extension of his patient: and the stake should stand between the two thighs of the patient holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should equalize the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant should hold the healthy leg at the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the health of its restoration is declared to you: then apply a poultice and tow, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must be cautious or fearful of the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too forceful over them and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, bind it tightly: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he attempts to walk before that period, there is no security that the dislocation will not be dissolved over him, and be corrupted, and not receive healing after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a warm abscess should occur to him, then it is necessary to administer in its reduction what was previously described by our account in another place concerning treatment and embrocation, until it is removed.

Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated among them be aligned with slight extension without difficulty: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot's arch: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on an even place on the ground, or on a board: and he should stand as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see it now even, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the arch of his foot a board that captures the entire foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release it, and have him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured from displacement.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Regarding the types of dislocations with wounds or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this kind occurs and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows: and for this reason one should not presume to treat such a condition unless he is wise in the art through long experience, merciful, pious, cautious, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he use at the outset only medicines which calm hot swellings: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for recovery from peril with the mildness of the illness, and in which there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot swelling occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb returns as we wish, then administer treatment that calms the swelling: and treat the wound with a drying ointment suitable for it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is dislocation with fracture, and saprae separate accidents occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do what we said for simple ailments resulting from that which precedes in their locations.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what my previous teaching has told you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them in your time.
