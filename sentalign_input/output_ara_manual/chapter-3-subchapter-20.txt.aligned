Chapter Twenty.	CHAPTER TWENTY.	0.8216454
On the treatment of stiffness that occurs after some fractures.	On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.	0.6465069
This stiffness often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, which deforms the limb and may prevent it from functioning normally.	This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.	0.80839866
Examine it, and if the stiffness is soft, use astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gentian, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.	0.82935435
Apply it to the stiffness in a compress and tie it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the stiffness is gone, God willing, or apply a tightly fitted lead plate.	Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing. Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.	0.7790102
Lead has a special property that removes any outgrowth on the limbs. If the stiffness has hardened and intensified, and the necessity to remove it is urgent, incise it from above and cut or scrape the protruding excess with a scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.	But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.70707893
