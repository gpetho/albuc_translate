Chapter Eighty-Six.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX.	0.84618664
On the Treatment of Coryza and Fistula.	On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.	0.71726745
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and it constantly suppurates without ceasing, it is called in general, in whatever limb it may be, a fistula, and we call it coryza, and the fistula.	You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.	0.83490753
It is in reality a hard, solid, white concretion, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.	The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.	0.7011274
And for this reason some have called it a feather, and it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be copious or scanty, thick or thin.	At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.	0.75431645
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its lips that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or it is very dirty and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that supplies it is of poor quality, or because the medication is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a particular characteristic of the town.	I said previously in the appropriate section, when I was discussing abscesses, that any ulcer that would not heal nor show growth of tissue was due to one of nine causes. One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.	0.85396767
Or it is very dirty and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that supplies it is of poor quality, or because the medication is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a particular characteristic of the town. As happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of swellings is naturally slow, or because there is one bone or several bones in it, and I have explained all these causes and their signs and treatments with medicines in the classification.	One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it. I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments.	0.85155153
And it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistulas and nasal catarrh, which is by manual operation. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body. Some fistulas end at large veins and arteries or at a nerve.	Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.	0.47974563
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the back, or to a joint of the many-jointed joints, such as the hand and the foot, and some of them lead to near a principal organ and so forth.	You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.	0.70060265
So what is of these fistulas of this description are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance. If there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I mentioned, and I hoped and aspired to treat them.	Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain. But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.	0.7311358
And you wanted to reach the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula runs straight, then examine it with it. If there is a curvature in the fistula, then examine it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body.	But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that. But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.	0.7583104
So it slips upon entry and bends towards the curvature. If the fistula has many openings, you cannot investigate them with the probe, so inject one of its openings, for the moisture that you inject with it will travel towards the other openings and flow out.	But if the fistula have multiple openings so that you cannot explore it with the probe, then make an injection into one of the openings. The fluid you inject into that one will run to the other openings and flow out from them.	0.8693253
From them, then investigate thoroughly in any way you can, so that you know if there is a bone or a nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Understand all of that to the best of your ability by inquiring of the sick person about the presence of pain when you press your hand on the place.	Then make a complete exploration by whatever means you can, to find out whether there be at that place a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula be deep or superficial, and whether the fistula be one with multiple openings. Inform yourself of all these points, exerting yourself to inquire of the patient whether he feels pain while you are compressing with the hand, and seeking other indications and causes of tumour that may arise.	0.8703167
And such as that of the signs and causes incidental to the swelling. So, if you understand all of that with certainty, then at that time proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you consider, if it is.	When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you.	0.44738686
The fistula is superficial and near, or in a healthy place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what preceded in my description, and extract what is in it of induration, corrupt flesh, and excess flesh.	Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.	0.5981451
And what grows in its opening of flesh or caruncle, and such as that, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated, and it is straight, it is appropriate that you incise it in the depth as much as you can, then cleanse it from all of its corrupt flesh.	If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.	0.6574092
Then use twisted pledgets dipped in sharp medications and insert them to the bottom of the fistula, which you reach with the iron instrument.  Do this to it repeatedly until that sharp medication consumes all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption.	Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula.	0.557309
Then dress it with the ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.  If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what preceded its description.  If the cause of the fistula is bone, and that is confirmed for you, then explore it and incise it according to what I informed you, if a preventative does not prevent you from that.	Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals. But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way. If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said.	0.85101855
A vessel or nerve, or a principal organ as we said.  If the bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what makes it heal until it heals.  If it does not heal and pus continues as it was doing,	And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed. If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely.	0.6647546
then know that you did not reach all of the removal of the corruption.  Expose all that is on it again and be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.  If it heals, then good, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess of corruption, expose all that is on it again.	If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely. Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it. Then dress it; and if it heals, good; if not, then you may know that this corruption is very deep-seated in the body and out of reach, and there is nothing you can do for it but leave it to nature.	0.7797614
And be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort.  If the corrupt bone is a small bone and you are able to extract it, then extract it with the delicate hooks which are suited for that.	If the diseased bone be a small one, and it be possible for you to extract it, then do so with a pair of fine forceps suited to the purpose.	0.71790093
If they are many bones, then be thorough in extracting them all, and do not leave anything of them to the best of your ability.  If something of the ligaments obstructs you before them, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh, if there is any there, and free the bones.	And if there be a number of bones then you must accurately carry out the extraction of all of them, and spare no effort to ensure that none is left. If any ligaments lie in your way and there be no danger in incising them, then make an incision into the ligaments and whatever tissues are there, and free the bones.	0.87615293
If you are unable to extract the bones at this time, then apply to the wound what will make it putrefy and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. And protect the wound so that the incision that you made during your work does not close.	If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones.	0.78026724
Rather, if you fear that, place upon it cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For if those ligaments putrefy and the bones are freed, it will be easy to extract and pull them.	Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments. Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.	0.8307897
If it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what has become corrupt of it is its surface only, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then treat the wound. If what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it.	If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound. If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.	0.91463965
And cut it all the way to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.  And I will tell you about a case that occurred to a man in his leg, for you to take it as an example and aid in your treatment.  This man was young in age.	Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.	0.62382114
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause that affected him from inside the body until the substances reached the leg, and it swelled with a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with errors by the doctors until the swelling opened.	This man was young, about thirty years of age. He once got a pain in the leg from something internal, which so worked that eventually matter came into the leg and caused it to swell greatly, there being no external cause.	0.79744637
And many substances flowed from it, and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became putrid and developed many openings, all of which exuded pus and bodily fluids. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, and among them was no one skilled in surgery.	And time passed by, to the accompaniment of error on the part of the doctors, until the tumour opened and much discharge came away; and the treatment was so mismanaged that fistulae formed in the leg and many sinuses opened up, all of which discharged pus and body humours. A whole host of doctors had been treating it for a matter of two years, not one of whom had any skill in the surgical art.	0.81738734
Until they came to me, and I saw his leg, and the substances were flowing profusely from those openings, and the man's body had become thin, and his color yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all of the openings.	Eventually he sought me. I saw his leg, with matter coming away from the orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was wasted and jaundiced. So I introduced a probe into one of the openings and the probe touched bone.	0.79545724
And I found them leading to one another from all sides of the leg, so I proceeded and made an incision on one of the openings until I exposed some of the bone.  I found it corrupt, eroded, blackened, putrefied and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow.  So I widened what was exposed to me.	Then I investigated all the openings and found them all communicating with one another in all parts of the leg. So I quickly cut down upon one of these openings until a part of the bone was laid bare, and I found it diseased, by now eaten away, and black and foul and full of holes, down to the marrow. So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at.	0.8582922
And I dealt with the corrupt bone, thinking that there was no other corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and exposed, and that I had eradicated it. Then I began to dress the wound with healing medications for a long period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and exposed the bone again, above the first exposure.	So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at. In fact I thought that there was no more disease in the bone beyond what I had cut and sawn away, and that I had completely eradicated it. Then I tried for a very long time to heal the wound with medicines encouraging growth of flesh, but it would not heal. Then I again uncovered the bone, above the first opening, and found the corruption co-extensive with the bone.	0.8628527
And I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I also exposed what appeared to me of that corruption. Then I tried to heal it, but it neither healed nor closed. Then I examined it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and tried to heal it, but it did not heal, until I had cut off about a span of the bone.	So again I sawed away as much of the corruption as I could see; then I tried to heal it, but it would not heal nor unite. Then I opened it up once more and went on cutting away the bone piecemeal and trying to heal it, and it would not heal until I had cut away about a span of bone with the marrow; then I treated it medicinally and it quickly healed over and was cured.	0.8829789
And I removed it with its marrow, then I dressed it with medications, and it healed quickly and he recovered. This repetition in the procedure and incisions was necessary because of the patient's weakness and low tolerance, and my fear of his death, because he was experiencing severe fainting from excessive vomiting at all times.  Then he recovered completely.	But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain.	0.65663075
And solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body was restored to health, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs.  And he did not experience any harmful affliction in walking whatsoever. If a protruding bone in a part of the body is broken…	But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored. He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.	0.81671894
It should be exposed in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull it upwards. Then use another bandage, made of wool thicker than the first bandage.	Now in the case of a prominent bone that has been broken in any part of the body, it should be sawn off in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone and bid someone keep it stretched upward; then you put on another ligature of wool thicker than the first, tying it to the tissue that is beneath the bone, and pull on the end so that the flesh is drawn down and you lay bare of flesh the spot where you intend to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.	0.6519301
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards. Meanwhile, you expose the flesh from the place you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.  Place a piece of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone.	You should place a block of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone; which done, there is no hindrance to the saw's cutting through the diseased bone.	0.6945529
Because if you do this, the saw will not be hindered from cutting the corrupted bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the corrupted area so that there is no corruption within the cavity of the bone which is not apparent on the surface, forcing you to saw it again.	The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.	0.7003356
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, but rather connected together, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath and saw it from the first side where the corruption is.	If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is.	0.8013043
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said.  If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.	When you have finished this, saw it from the other side. The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said. If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.	0.7456331
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than scraping.  If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and clean it in whatever way you can.	If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping. If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.	0.79303145
And by whatever method works for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve. Know that the chisels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their placement, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work a tool suitable for that work.	Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.	0.83208585
And know that the procedures themselves may guide you to the type of instrument that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever has mastered the craft has witnessed various kinds of diseases. So he may devise for himself tools suitable for each disease, and I will depict for you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments.	You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease.	0.8676878
Make them examples to emulate and a standard by which you can measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:	At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing: Saw.	0.5447689
