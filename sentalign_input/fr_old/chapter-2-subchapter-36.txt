Of the abscesses of the throat
Sometimes inside the throat, lumps called "godath" appear, properly known as the two tonsils, and when you treat them as we have described earlier, and they are not healed, take note: if it is a hard abscess of little substance and a dark color, do not touch it with a knife. And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with a knife either, because of the risk of bleeding; but leave it until it ripens, and then you can split it, or it will rupture on its own; and if it is white and round in color, and the root is thin, prepare the instrument for cutting, but first ensure the hot abscess is calm and settled. Then seat the patient in front of the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth and have the assistant hold his hands, and press down the tongue with the instrument, which has this form; and it should be made of silver or fine bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out as much as you can; and pull some of the surrounding tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, which has this form, resembling forceps; and the ends are curved, one towards the other, and very sharp, made of fine iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument, cut it with forceps, which have this form:
And it should be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same way, and after the incision have the patient gargle with warm water, and water and plantain, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water, or boiled pomegranate peels, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding stops; then treat it until it is healed; and sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them just like the two tonsils in the same way.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had developed inside her throat, which was a small abscess; and it had nearly closed her entire throat, so she could not breathe through the blocked passage, and could not eat or drink, and would have died if she stayed that way for a day or two. The abscess had grown so much that it had pushed through both nostrils. I hurried immediately, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus; then did the same with the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue; then inserted the hook into the abscesses, and cut part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of her throat was unblocked, and she started to drink water and then wine, and I kept cutting that abscess for a long time; and the abscess kept growing back, filling the space I had emptied, until it became very large; then I tricked it and cauterized it inside the throat: so it remained without growing; and I left that area, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
