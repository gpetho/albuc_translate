A dislocated toe should be gently realigned without much effort; this is usually easy to do.	Any that are dislocated must be straightened by means of gentle extension, without violence; that is not hard but positively easy.	0.6753693
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, have the patient sit with their foot on an even surface or table, as if they were standing.	If the dislocation be in one of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, the patient must set his foot on level ground or upon a board, standing as though walking.	0.81268823
Then stand and place your foot over the dislocated joints, pressing down firmly until they return to place, ensuring they are aligned and no swelling appears.	Then you must stand and put your foot on what protrudes of those joints, and put strong pressure upon it with your foot until it goes back and you see that it is evened out and there is no prominence at the place.	0.8236292
Then place a board under the sole of the foot to support it completely, securing it with a tight and firm bandage for three days; then remove the bandage and have the patient rest without walking for many days until it is stable and the reduction is confirmed.	Then put under the sole of his foot a flat splint with two heads to take the whole foot, and bind it on with a tight and secure bandage for three days; then loosen it; but keep him from walking for a good many days until it binds and you are sure it will not revert, God willing.	0.8445761
