On the Relaxation of the Scrotum.	On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.	0.76425207
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance becomes unsightly.  So, whoever wishes to treat it should have the patient lie on his back.	In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within. This has a horrible appearance. He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal.	0.76548696
And he cuts all the skin that has relaxed to the thick skin, then brings the two edges together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.	Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture. Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm. Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches.	0.8475715
Then treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.	Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.	0.74427986
