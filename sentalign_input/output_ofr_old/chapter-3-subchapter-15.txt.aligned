And the restoration is that you put together what is round with your fingers, so that it is assembled as best as you can; then apply the plaster, and put a round splint on it, if you need one, and tighten it as needed, then consider all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and other similar things; then address each issue with what is appropriate for it, until it is healed.	Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve. Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage. Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.	0.8321346
