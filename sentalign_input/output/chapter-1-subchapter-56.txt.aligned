Many times large flows of blood occur from the artery which is cut in a wound that comes to the surface, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cautery of a limb, and in similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stop.	Very often there occurs bleeding from an artery which has been cut either by an external wound or in opening an abscess or in cauterizing a part of the body and so on, and it is difficult to stem.	0.82688046
And nevertheless, when this happens to someone, hurry to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no more drops come out; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.	When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out. Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot. Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.91597587
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire.	0.85007024
And do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be easily stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not severed, or by tight tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and constricted properly.	Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched. Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient. You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.9106356
Whoever would attempt to stop it by tightly binding with cloths or by putting burning things on it, or other similar things, will benefit little if at all.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.63135636
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a doctor or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stopped over the wound and over the vein; and do not move the finger, but wet it with cold water, very cold water, often until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped; and from then on do what is necessary with cauteries and medicines.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow. And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.9071678
