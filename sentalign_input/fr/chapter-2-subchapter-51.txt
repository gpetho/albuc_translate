Of the large hanging swellings
Sometimes thelul occurs in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to fungi, with a thin root and a large head; and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two on his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, with thin roots, and were already split, and moisture was constantly flowing from them.
I cut them and found one weighing 18 ounces, and the other 6 ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist with thin roots;
then cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery ready in the fire. Because often there is too much blood flow during the cutting, and if the blood overwhelms you, then quickly cauterize it;
and if you see the patient is frightened and afraid of the knife incision, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the growth as we have said, and leave it for two days;
then tighten it, and keep tightening the lead thread until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without trouble; and if the roots are large, it is dangerous to cut, especially for the belly, but you can cut half of it,
then cauterize it so it doesn't return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul that is of dark color and poor quality and looks bad.
Because it is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.
