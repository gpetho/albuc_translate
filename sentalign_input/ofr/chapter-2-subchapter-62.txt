of fleshy hernia
A watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white hydrocele, which is below the covering of the testicles that contains the testicle; and it is called "hydrocele", and sometimes it is specifically in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white hydrocele that we have mentioned; and this does not occur except rarely.
And the cause of this hernia is a weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is blood red, or black, or watery white, and this occurs more often; and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white hydrocele that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around it.
And if there is moisture in the membrane itself, then the abscess is round along with a part of the testicle, and therefore one thinks that it is another testicle; and if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white hydrocele, then one feels it well; therefore when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown above. 
According to what then comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths under him; then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and stretch the penis to one of the two sides near the heart of the testicles; then take the milk-white spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum through it lengthwise down near the penis, and make your incision perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the scrotum down to the white hydrocele, and peel it carefully according to your ability; then pierce the hydrocele full of water with a large hole, and extract all the water, and then insert your hooks, and stretch the hydrocele upwards; and do not touch the heart of the testicle, but only the hydrocele; cut it all or in pieces evenly along its side, carefully, because if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return; and if the testicle comes out during your work, return it to its place when you have completed the work on the hydrocele; then bring together the two edges near the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, you must tie the spermatic cord which suspends it, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle along with the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if fluid is collected in two parts together, know that these are two branches; cut the other part as you did the first, equally, then wipe the blood and put wool soaked in rose oil in the wound; and above put other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over both testicles, and put doubled cloths on top, and tie it up with the bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and join them by stitching at the opening of the pants, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks up to the back, and the other to the area of the penis; and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the tightening be gathered in the buckle of the pants; and sometimes this branch is treated with a cautery instead of a cutting iron, and that is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the scrotum, and it should be heated as we have said, so that the white hydrocele which contains the water is uncovered; then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce this hydrocele with the hooks, and peel it with this thin, hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you remove everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle; and know that this work is safer, and less prone to bleeding, and gentler than the work of cutting; and if anything opposes you, either a hot abscess or bleeding or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid, and does not want to endure this procedure because of its horribleness, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and that is when you are quite certain by the signs that we have described that a watery branch is there, have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body; and let the hole be wide, so that all the water runs out; then put cotton over the place, and tie it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed; and if the white cloth does not let the water flow out at the opening of the wound, you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsical patients, the form of which is shown above; and widen the wound a little, and know that the water will return, and collect again after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, the patient will thus spend his days.
