On the treatment of two types of hermaphroditism.	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.7778897
Hermaphroditism among males occurs in two forms. One form appears as a space or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, resembling the shape of a woman’s vulva, with hair present; and sometimes urine flows from the area in the skin of the testicles.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.86242104
In women, there is one form where the vulva is located on the pubic area, resembling the small testicles of a male, slightly protruding outward: one part resembles a male penis, and two parts resemble two testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.7115555
The treatment for these three types—two forms in males and one form in females—is to cut away the excess flesh until its impression disappears. Then, treat them with the usual wound care until healed.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.	0.8013344
For the second type in men, where urine flows from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or treatment whatsoever.	As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.8360069
