The author of this book completed it for you, my sons, as a part of the science of medicine in its entirety and has reached the goal within it through clarity and explanation. I saw that I should complete it with this chapter which is a part of the work by hand.
Because the art of surgery is non-existent in our land and at our time, almost to the point where its knowledge is not studied and its influence ceases. And what remained of it was only slight sketches in the books of the ancients, which were blurred by the passage of time and the mistakes and confusion that occurred until its meaning was lost and its benefit was delayed.
So I saw that I should revivify it and compile this chapter in the manner of explanation and illustration, and come with the forms of surgical instruments and all the tools of work as they are necessary for clarity and to facilitate what is required.
And the reason why there is no skilled surgeon in our time because the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its practitioner to be familiar beforehand with the science of anatomy which Galen described. Until he stands on the benefits of the organs and their functions, and how they are connected and disconnected, and knows the bones, nerves, muscles, and their numbers, exits, and blood vessels and tendons and where their exits are.
Therefore, Albucasis said that physicians are many by name but few in reality and especially in the art of surgery, and we have mentioned some aspects of this in the introduction to this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned in anatomy may fall into error and kill people with it, just as I have seen many who pretend to know this science without knowledge or understanding.
And that is because I saw a ignorant doctor who cut into a goiter in a woman's neck, and he severed some of the neck's ligaments so the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead at his feet.
I saw a doctor who extracted a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the back and the stone was large so he broke it out with a piece of bladder membrane. The man died after about three days, and I was summoned to extract it, so I saw the stone and the patient's condition as I had predicted.
I saw another doctor who was working with some of our town's notables in medicine.
Then an incident occurred with a young man who had a fracture in his leg near the ankle, along with a wound. The doctor hastened to it without knowledge and applied the splint to the wound with bands and ligatures tightly, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he let him follow his desires, then left him for a few days and ordered him not to remove the bandage until his leg and foot had swollen and was on the verge of death.
Then I was summoned to him, and I hastened to remove the bandage. He gained relief from his pain and sat up from his distress, but the damage had already become severe in the limb, and I was unable to restore it.
So the damage continued to progress in the limb until he died.
I saw another doctor who treated a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after some days until his patient's swelling grew, that is, if the cancer was pure from black bile, then one should not apply iron to it at all.
Unless it is in an organ that can tolerate its removal.
And so, my sons, you should know that the practice of medicine is divided into two parts: one that accompanies safety and one that brings harm in most cases.
And I have warned about every place where this book's practice brings danger and fear, so you should beware of it and reject it.
Unless the ignorant one finds the way to speak and cut, take hold of yourselves with firmness and self-control, and treat your patients with kindness and reassurance.
And use the best route leading to safety and the praised outcome, and overcome the serious and difficult diseases.
And purify yourselves from what you fear may corrupt your faith and your worldly and otherworldly affairs, for this is the greatest blessing for your souls and elevated in both worlds and hereafter for your destinies.
For Galen said in some of his counsels: Do not cure a bad disease, and call yourselves bad doctors.
And this treatise has been divided into three doors.
The first door.
In fire and in acute medicine, a summary of the art from the beginning to the end, and illustrations of the instruments and equipment needed for manual work.
The second door.
In surgery, the treatment of wounds, bloodletting, cupping, and phlebotomy, and extracting arrows and similar things, a summary in order with illustrations of the instruments.
The third door.
In setting fractures, removing splints, and treating ulcers and similar things, a summary in order from beginning to end with illustrations of the instruments.
The first door.
About fire.
And before we mention the use of it, we should mention its benefits and drawbacks, and in what temperament it is used.
For I say that the discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of fire is a long and detailed knowledge, and a hidden secret, which some wise men have discussed.
And they disagreed about it, and I have only briefly mentioned their words, out of fear of prolonging the discussion.
For I say that fire is beneficial in general to every bad temperament, whether it is with matter or without matter, except for two temperaments: the fiery temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they have differed in that some say that it is beneficial and others say that it is contrary to that, saying that it does not suit a disease that comes from heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is possible to treat a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry medicine, and he who says contrary to that says that the fire can be effective in treating a hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies. Because when you mix the moisture of the human body with the temperament of fire, it cools the human body down.
And I say so because experience has revealed it to me on many occasions, but one should not assume that without having thoroughly studied and learned about the matter. And he based himself on the difference in temperaments of people, and their diseases, and their causes, symptoms, and durations.
And as for the other temperaments, there is no fear of them, and especially not the cold and moist diseases, upon which all physicians have agreed and have not disagreed about the effectiveness of fire in treating them.
And know, my sons, that one who excels in treating with fire and values it over burning medicine because fire is a single substance whose action is confined to the part where it is applied and does not harm another connected part except slightly.
And the burning medicine may exceed its action to other parts and perhaps cause a disease in another part that is difficult to treat, or even be fatal; whereas fire, by virtue of its nobility and excellence, does not do so except if it is excessive.
And this has been revealed to us through experience, after a long period of service and care in the craft, and by standing on the truths of the matter.
And therefore I have spared you from a long speech, but if it were not fitting for this book of mine, I would have explained to you in the fire a mysterious secret and its manner of action in the bodies, and how it rejects diseases with philosophical and demonstrative language that would clarify your understanding.
Know that my sons that they have disagreed on the time when it is proper to do a c-section and they have considered best the spring season.
And I say that a c-section can be done at any time, for the harm caused by delay is absorbed by the benefit brought about by the c-section. And especially if the c-section is necessary for a serious and imminent danger that cannot be delayed, lest it result in greater harm than the initial harm caused by delay.
And do not let your minds, my sons, be swayed by the ignorant and inexperienced doctors who think that a c-section is only necessary when there is no possibility of recovery from an illness and it will only result in death.
And do not think that the c-section is only a means of administering medicine to alleviate the mood and dry up the humors that are the cause of the pain.
Unless the c-section surpasses medicine in terms of rapid success, strong action, and intense effect.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament and their ability to resist it, as well as the accumulation of humors in their body and neglecting themselves by indulging in their desires and similar causes.
May God forbid that the illness for which a c-section is performed be a trivial one and affecting a small area with minimal humors and moisture. Like an excision of a tooth from the pain, and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return in such cases and this would be the best.
And as for the saying of the common people that a c-section is the last resort, it is a true saying not going against what they claim because they believe that there is no treatment effective by medicine or otherwise after a c-section has taken place and this is unlike other cases.
And indeed the meaning of "Innama" is that whenever we use various treatments for a disease and those treatments do not benefit, then we use what remains as a remedy, so from here the outcome is "Innama" the last treatment. Not according to the opinion of the common people and many ignorant doctors.
And the ancients mentioned that the k朝 (last resort) with gold is better than the k朝 with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and its noble essence, and they said it does not harm the place of the k朝; it is not at all like that.
For I have tried that and found it to be the case, for it does this in some bodies rather than others, and the k朝 with it is better and more excellent than iron as they said; except that if you protect the material from fire using gold, you will not know when to stop at the quantity of gold you desire because of its redness.
And because it hastens towards cold and if you add more to the fever it melts in fire, and we found the craftsman busy with that; therefore the k朝 with iron is faster and closer to the truth for work, God willing.
And I have organized this book on the k朝 into chapters from head to foot in order to make it easy for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
The First Chapter.
On the K朝 of the Head: One Method.
This k朝 is effective against the oppression of moisture and cold on the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent vomiting from the head to the direction of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. In general, this k朝 is beneficial for every disease that arises from cold, such as apoplexy, epilepsy, and numbness, and other similar diseases.
Image of this kind: first, instruct the patient to take the gentle and purified medicine for the head three nights or four according to what is required by the patient's strength, age, and habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him in front of you, reclining and placing his hands on his chest.
Then place the tip of your finger on the tip of his nose between his eyes, and where the middle phalanx of your finger ends, mark that spot with a dot.
Then take the ointment.
If you have exposed a part of the skull equal to the space between two scales or equal to a grain of barley, lift your hand and if not, then retract your hand with the same razor or another one if it is cold. Until you see the bone as I mentioned to you, then take something of salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of linen in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then wrap it with a wet linen soaked in lard, and leave it on him until the scab falls off like ash from fire, then treat it with the quadruple ointment until he recovers if God wills.
And they said that an open wound, the more it remains open, the better and more effective it is.
And some of them said that the skin should be sewn onto the bone, and hold the ointment until some thickness of the bone is burned, then remove what has been burned from the bone, and treat it.
And others said that it is necessary to apply the caustic substance until it has a strong effect on the bone, so that it falls off like a scale or a small piece of bark, and they claimed that this substance purifies the head from that spot and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then he treats until it heals, and I do not see these two types of ulcers anywhere else except in some people on the way of holes and leaving it with me. If that is the case, then the head swells when its natural connection is severed as we have seen in all other limbs.
And especially when the patient's head is weak by nature and I use the first type of ulcers, it works well with me and I work with it accordingly, if Allah wills.
The second chapter.
Also in the head.
If an inflammation occurs in the head, and it becomes chronic and persists in the patient, and I have tried applying poultices, fomentations, plasters, dressings, and bandages, especially if he has had only one ulcer as we described, and nothing has benefited him from that, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he finds a severe ulcer, then I cover another ulcer above it slightly. Then I cover all the bones of his head with an ulcer until the thickness of the skin goes away and the bone condition we described is revealed. And I cover an ulcer in the back of his head, at the spot known as the hatchet, and ease off your hand here so that you do not reveal the bone, because the patient will find it very painful, unlike the pain of all other ulcers on the head; and I will mention this ulcer in its place.
And the covering that covers the horns of the head and its back should be softer than the one that covers the middle of the head, and this is its shape.
The third chapter.
Also in the femur that is not chronic.
If inflammation occurs in the skull with a headache and dizziness, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient relieves himself with purgatives for the head and applies all the treatment I mentioned earlier; if that does not work, then the ulcer is on two sides. If it is necessary to treat by a hot medication and melted oil, or by iron.
If it is necessary to treat by hot medication, it is that you take a piece of garlic, and scrape it, and cut its edges from both sides, then split the place of pain on the cheek with a broad knife until there is a space under the skin which can accommodate the garlic.
He inserts it under the skin until it disappears, then tightens it with a firm grip and leaves it for as long as fifteen hours, then releases it and takes out the garlic, leaving the wound two or three days before removing.
On it, anoint with a thread soaked in fat until the place becomes numb, then treat it with ointment until it heals if God wills, and if you wish, do that with some of the hot medicines I mentioned in chapter 18 of the hot medicines.
And as for treating it by iron, on this manner: make the instrument which is shown thus:.
And it is called the Somanian instrument because its head resembles a small peg with some wrapping, and in the middle of it there is a small groove.
Then you put it on the place of pain, and grasp your hand tightly while turning the iron a little by little, and what is burnt from the thickness of the skin will be about half. And raise your hand so that you don't burn the artery that is below, and bleeding occurs, then take a thread in salt water and put it on the place and leave it for three days. Then anoint the thread with fat, and treat it with ointment until it heals if God wills.
And if you wish, cut this ligature with the sharp edge that comes from the instrument and keep it away from cutting the artery in this ligature especially.
The Fourth Chapter.
Concerning Chronic Haemorrhoids.
If you treated the piles with what we have mentioned as treatment beforehand and with what we have mentioned in the division of diseases, and the treatment did not succeed, and I saw from the cause that it is not capable of being cured by what we have mentioned first, either through medicine or fire. Then it is necessary to guard the skin until it becomes white, after you have learned where the pain is by its length in a straight line of half an inch or so, and leave your hand once and pull it back until it cuts the artery and reaches towards the bone.
Unless you take care to separate the jawbone which moves when chewing, and burn or sever the muscle or nerve controlling it, so that contraction occurs.
And be on guard for bleeding from the artery which you have cut, as there is fear of its cutting. Especially not for one who does not know what to do and has not been tried and tested, and has left the first attempt.
And the treatment of bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in this book, God willing. If you see from the cause that it cannot be cured by this cauterization.
And if you see the patient's body obstructed, apply cauterization in the middle of the head as we have described and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on arresting blood flow with the double-edged knife, for it is a better and more effective cauterization.
The Fifth Chapter.
Concerning Cerebral Hemorrhages.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it has been treated with poultices and all the treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then guard the point that is called the nodule which this resembles.
Then wrap it with that after warming it around all the ears just like it wraps around them both if the pain is in both. And remove the ligature from the root of the ear a little after learning the position with ink, and the ligature should be about ten points in each ear or around it. Then treat the positions until it is cured if Allah wills.
The sixth chapter.
In the ligature of the claw.
The ligature which is treated with the ligature is only that of the type which occurs from phlegm as I mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
And avoid the ligature of the type which occurs from membranes and stretching of the nerve.
When you treated this type of ligature with poultices, compresses, and cupping and it did not benefit your treatment then the patient should be treated with three ligatures. One at the root of the ear, the second slightly below the cheekbone, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your ligature on the opposite side of the affected part because relaxation only occurs in the healthy side.
And the shape of the ligature is to apply it as a ligature on the side of the upper part of the ear under the temporal bone slightly, and another one on the cheekbone, and its length should be according to the length of the eyebrow.
You bring your hand down with the ligature until you burn a quarter of the skin thickness, and this is the shape of the cauterization and it is a type of cauterization which I mentioned its form earlier but it is slightly softer than that as you see. And it is necessary for the cauterizer to be a little thicker, then treat the place as mentioned earlier until it is cured if Allah wills.
The Seventh Chapter.
On Chronic Hemorrhage.
If you have treated the hemorrhage and applied what we mentioned, but your treatment has not been effective and there is no apparent cause of fever, then perform four ligatures. One ligature at the top of his head and another in the middle of the head, as we mentioned, and one in the occiput of the head, above what has been mentioned.
And the recipe for the caustic substance is as previously mentioned, and it may also be applied with a ligature to the mouth of the stomach, which will make it more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
The Eighth Chapter.
On Amputation.
He who has a condition caused by phlegm should first be given an infusion of large doses of purgative herbs and cleansing agents for the brain.
Then he should have his entire head shaved and a poultice of mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on ulcers, be applied to the occiput repeatedly, for it is one of the remedies.
And do that to the affected area, exactly as described there, for he will be cured by doing so; otherwise, perform three ligatures on his occiput, arranged from the top of the head to the neck.
And place a thick finger's width between each ligature and the next, then treat as previously mentioned; if you wish to increase it and the patient is capable of withstanding it, perform the middle ligature.
If you wish to increase it, perform another ligature on the temples, then treat until he is cured; and the caustic substance will be resinous in accordance with what has been previously mentioned.
The Ninth Chapter.
On Apoplexy and Relaxation of the Entire Body.
He should be given an infusion of purgative herbs and what we mentioned, then have his head shaved and a ligature applied in the middle of the head, a ligature on each temple of the head, and a ligature on the occiput.
If three fingers are applied to the vertebrae of the neck, and it is necessary to relax the body further due to a strong and steady disease, then place four fingers on the vertebrae of his back. And make the poultice adhere until most of it is burned into the skin, then lift your hand and treat him as mentioned earlier until he recovers if Allah wills, and the poultice shall be ointment-like.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the case of epilepsy.
For indeed, the one who is seized with epilepsy that arises from phlegm should first cleanse his brain with large vessels and all other treatments mentioned in the division, if the illness is great and possible for taking medicine.
And as for the one who is a child and cannot tolerate medicine, then use the clarifying and purging substances for the brain several days before that, with improvement of his diet.
Then have him shaved and place one poultice in the middle of his head as mentioned in the description, and another in his occiput. And on each horn of his head, a poultice; if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then place the poultices mentioned for the one with epilepsy and relax the body on the vertebrae of the neck and back, and the poultice shall be ointment-like as described.
If the illness is in a child, then make the poultice gentle on this shape.
The Eleventh Chapter.
In the case of melancholy.
If the cause of melancholy is putrid humors and thick phlegm, then place the poultices mentioned for one with epilepsy.
If the cause of melancholy is leaning towards darkness and the body of the patient is wet and putrid, then cleanse his brain as mentioned in the division.
Then cut off the patient's head, then make a firm cake from linen, like a circle. Then put it in the middle of his head, and the patient sitting upright, holding from each side, then take one piece from old goat suet.
Then heat it on the fire, moderately hot, as much as the finger can endure if inserted into it. Then put it in the middle of his head, in the circle, and leave it until it cools. Do that with the patient every week, along with good management, until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, wet it with many small dots, not grasping the instrument with your hand but with a gentle touch; for this type of wetting cools the brain moderately.
Then put a soaked thread on him, in the suet or in chicken fat.
The Twelfth Chapter.
Regarding the water that falls into the eye.
If you notice the water that falls into the eye, indicating the symptoms mentioned in the classification, then begin to cleanse the patient's head and body of all impurities and bathe him in a bath with soap for several days.
Then pass a thread around his head and tie it in the middle of the head, then tie two threads on the temples if the water begins to flow into both eyes or from one side only if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the instrument all the veins and arteries under the skin, making sure that the threads are there in length along the temples and prevent bleeding.
If you see anything from it, cut it at the spot using any treatment possible and we will come to the wisdom of binding the arteries and cutting them and preventing bleeding.
And two threads can be tied in the occiput under the bones.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In Chronic Cases of Weeping.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and it is due to blood vessels and membranes which appear on the surface of the head from outside the head, and I have ascertained that this is due to a thick, gelatinous discharge reaching the canal I described at the beginning of the flow of water. A canal in the middle of the head, and two canals on the temples, and two under the occipital bones, and if necessary, I would increase the canal at each side of the eye on the margin of the eyebrow with a small instrument.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In Chronic Cases of Nasal Discharge.
If he has been treated as mentioned in the chapter and the treatment did not succeed, then he should apply a poultice of tar for three nights and then shave his head and open up the central canal with an ointment instrument. Then open up with the vermilion instrument two canals above the eyebrows, a little beneath the hair, and be careful not to cut the artery; this is the shape of the vermilion.
The Fifteenth Chapter.
In Chronic Cases of Relaxation of the Eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, open up the eyelid with this crescent-shaped instrument.
And if you wish, open up above the eyebrows a little, two canals on each side, and keep them apart from the temples, and let the length of each canal be as long as the eyebrow.
And do not overdo it with the canal, but to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and this is the shape of the instrument.
The Sixteenth Chapter.
In Chronic Cases of Eyelid.
If it is turned upside down into the socket, then the upper part of the eye should be cut out and the rest will be like that. Either it is cauterized with fire or it is treated with a burning medicine, so if it is cauterized with fire, the patient should be told to stop shaving his eyebrows until they grow long and even.
If it is pulled out when it is growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows and becomes even. When it has grown and become even, place the patient's head on a stone and mark the eyelid of the eye with ink in the shape of an aspen leaf.
And the mark will begin near the eyebrows, then place a thread dyed in white of egg or in masticated mulberry under the eyelid, and preserve this image.
Then rub it gently, a little at a time, many times until the surface of the skin which is in the shape of an aspen leaf becomes all rough and distinct, and a sign of the success of your work that you will see the eyelid raised up and the hair risen above the edge of the eye.
Then raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days, then place a thread with fat on it until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it clears up if God wills. If anything of the hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Then re-treat the area as you did initially, if the hair is in the lower eyelid, remove it until it returns to its natural place and does not fall onto the eye. And if it is treated with a burning medicine, then tell the patient to stop shaving his eyebrows until they grow long and even.
Then make an image of an aspen leaf from paper, then take from the familiar soap and unground gypsum each one weighing a dirham or so, and crush them both together thoroughly with a mortar until they are well mixed. Then stretch it out on the cloth you have prepared, in the shape of a asphodel leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids. Put a moistened thread under the eye and a headrest in your stone.
And place your index finger above the medicine and press it lightly as you move it whenever the patient feels a craving for the medicine because he finds pleasure in it like fire. As long as he finds pleasure, leave the medicine and move your finger; if the pleasure subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look; if you see the eyelid has risen like it rises when burned or cut, otherwise, repeat the treatment on the part where the medicine did not take effect and was not absorbed until you complete your work and the eye calms down, then put a cotton swab with fat on it until the scab forms.
Then treat it with the almond ointment or other until it heals, and it is necessary for you to be extremely careful when working so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after some days and hair grows in the eye.
Then repeat the treatment on that part of the eyelid which has relaxed, just as you did at first, then treat it until it heals, and this is the shape of an asphodel leaf.
And know that people's eyes may differ in size and shape, so adjust your treatment accordingly. And there is no way to go astray for one who has experience with this craft.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
About the cornea that appears in the eye socket.
If you treated the cornea as we mentioned in the sections of diseases and it did not benefit from your treatment, then you should attribute this to its nature.
The patient should place his head on a pillow and have it held in position by an attendant between your hands, not moving or striking his head.
Then you should put a moist thread in the white of an egg or on the tongue of a leech and apply it to his eyes, then cover the bandage with this shape.
It will be shaped like a falcon's tube, one end being the part with the knot and if you wish it to be open at the other end or if you wish it to be closed like a reed, but this shape is better for your work, God willing.
Then you should cut the ligament if it is open and remove the excess and clean it, or if it is not open then you should open it and extract the clot, and then place the bandage on it, which is very protective, so that you can hold onto it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand a little when reaching the knot, from the eye to the direction of the nose, so that your hand does not err or disturb the patient, and the bandage does not fall into the eye socket and damage it. If you reach the bone in the first attempt, and if not, then redo the bandage once again if necessary.
And leave it for three days, then apply a thread with fat and treat him with dried ointment until he recovers. If it is not healed after forty days, then apply the strong and severe medicine until the bone is exposed, and consider what will be mentioned later in its chapter, God willing.
And the last part of the ligament, mentioned by some of the early ones, aims at the location of the ligament, cuts it, and then puts into the same cut a thin pessary, this is its shape.
And fill it with the weight of a lead dirham, dissolved and hold your hand on the pessary firmly, tightly grasped, without the patient moving at all, lest the melted lead flows into his eye. It is necessary to put a moist thread in the white of an egg or in water on the patient's eye.
If the lead corrodes it will burn the nasal passage and free it in a wondrous way, if the nasal passage is freed as mentioned earlier from the knot and treatment; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal piercing and direct the lead back into the nasal passage as will be mentioned in its specific place.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
In the division of the cheek.
Often a split occurs in the cheek, which is called "shirra", and especially in children's cheeks, for it often happens; if you treat this split as mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, then attach a small skin-thin splint to it like this.
It will be placed in the groove of the splint, then the applicator will put it in the same split until the knot reaches the depth of the split, then treat it with cautery until it is healed, if God wills.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the division of the nasal passage occurring in the mouth.
If it appears in the gum, or in the uvula, or in the roots of the teeth and becomes a boil that bursts and becomes a nasal passage then treated but the treatment was unsuccessful, it is necessary to apply a splint as much as can fit into the nasal passage.
Then the applicator will put it in the nasal passage and hold your hand until the cautery reaches its upper and lower parts, and do that once or twice, then treat it after that with what is mentioned from the treatment until it is healed, if God wills.
If the material is torn and it is freed; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the rotten bone according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, if God wills.
The Twentieth Chapter.
On clefts and loose teeth.
If the tooth has become loose due to moisture and the clefts have been treated with medicine, but it did not heal; then put the patient's head in a vice and bind the splint which is shown after this, once you place the tube on the molar.
And the splint enters into it, guarded by a wheel, and you hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the molar; then lift your hand and repeat the splint as many times as you want, then fill the patient's mouth with saltwater.
And you hold it for an hour and then let go, because the loose molar is set right and the tooth becomes firmer, and the foul moisture dries up.
The twentieth chapter.
On pain of the molar.
If the pain of the molar is due to cold or there is an abscess, and the treatment with medicine did not heal; then the solution is on two faces: either the application of fat or the application of fire.
The application of fat is that you take cow fat, boil it in an iron pot or a cauldron, then take a string and wrap it around the end of the molar, then immerse it in the boiled fat and place it on the aching tooth with a wheel and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the molar, and if you wish, immerse a cloth or string in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth and put a protected iron above it until the fire reaches the base of the tooth.
And the application of fire is that you take a copper or iron tube with some roughness in it, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then bind the splint which is shown and place it on the same tooth and hold your hand until the splint cools, do this several times.
If the wound goes away either that very day or the next, it is necessary after that to fill the mouth of the patient with good fat and hold it for an hour then spit it out, and this is the shape of the poultice.
Cut with whatever side you wish and on the depth that allows, and this is the shape of the tube.
The 22nd chapter.
For swine wounds.
If the swine is about phlegm and cold dampness and does not respond to maturation with medicine, and you want rapid maturation, then wet the hollow poultice whose shape is this one on both sides.
Let the smoke come out from the poultice on the other side and place it covered on the same ulcer once or twice as needed until you reach the depth of the ulcer; if the ulcer is small, make the poultice in proportion to the ulcer.
Then leave it for three days and wrap him with a soaked wool in fat until what was burned by the fire goes away, then treat him with ointment and threads until he recovers if God wills.
The 23rd chapter.
For wounds of hoarseness of the voice and shortness of breath.
If the dampness prevails over the trachea and especially if that is accompanied by cold temperament, it is necessary for the patient to first take soothing medicines, then apply a poultice in the notch of the throat at the base of the larynx in the low position.
Be cautious not to reach the poultice with the wound to the larynx, nor burn more than half of the skin, then apply another poultice at the joint of the neck in its last curve by gentle pressure and let it be wrapped on the shape that was mentioned before.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he is cured if God wills.
The 24th Chapter.
In cases of lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and there is no fever or yellow bile, and the disease is chronic; then make two incisions above the collarbones in the hollows, and another one in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the poultice will be as described earlier, and if you wish it can be a puncture with the poultice which is called the point, and its picture has been mentioned earlier in puncturing earache, and the points will be thirty to nearly that.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned earlier until he is cured, and you can make a poultice with three branches in this shape, and use it to puncture the place, for you are piercing there at once three punctures, and this is the picture of the poultice.
The 25th Chapter.
In cases of hernia.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to flowing rheum or it does not stay in its place when you return it, until it becomes habitual and then dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have seen, therefore one must return the joint first. Then the patient will lie on their back or on the correct side, and then raise the skin inside the armpit up to above with your left hand fingers if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then wrap it with the poultice having two layers, which is this picture.
Then puncture it with the poultice until it reaches the other side and four punctures take shape, or you can puncture with a poultice having three layers, in which case the punctures will be six and the layers on the surface of the wound.
This is a picture of a three-layered pad.
And it may be added to this number one, so the pads will become eight. Then it is placed on the sore with the crushed dates and salt, then it adheres to the patient's back without moving for a long time until it is healed, unless there is a discharge above, which rarely happens.
A pad is placed above the shoulder, one good and firm or multiple ones dripping with water. The joint tightens up, the moisture goes away, and the patient recovers.
The 26th Chapter.
In the stomach pad.
If there is a cold and moisture in the stomach to the extent that it expels its contents, and the diarrhea increases and is treated with various remedies but does not heal, then the patient should lie on his back, stretch out his legs and arms, and be wrapped in three pads. A pad is placed under the arm, as long as a finger, with a firm compress and two pads below it on either side of the single pad, until the shape of the pads becomes triangular, with space between them so they do not stick together. The depth of the pad should be one-third of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the pads is such that.
On this picture and to this extent without further addition.
And if you wish, wrap him in a single large pad in the middle of the stomach on this shape.
And the compress that wraps with this single pad is circular in shape, like this picture.
And the stomach is wrapped dripping with water, for one who is suffering from this pad, which is to learn on the stomach points on the spot where you want with the ink then wrap him with a pointed compress and treat him with the remedy that is presented until he recovers.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
Of the Cold Liver.
If the liver shows inflammation due to coldness, moisture, or severe wind, until it departs from its natural temperament in an excessive manner and treatment was applied according to what we mentioned in the classification, but that did not benefit. It is necessary that the patient lies down on his back and has three poultices made of liquid applied to this shape and this quantity, specifically on the liver below the ribs where the human arm ends.
And after each poultice and poultice, it should be thick on the finger, and the poultice should be straight along the body without your hand being attached to the mortar at all.
And it should be to the extent that it burns away half of the skin's thickness, no more; and the patient should stand on his feet if he is able, otherwise he will lie down with his legs stretched out and his arms raised, and this is the form of the mortar.
And you can mix these poultices with the Sikanee mortar if you have the skill and craftsmanship, and be careful not to burn the skin excessively, lest you burn it all and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so beware.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
Of the Lumps of the Liver Treated with Poultices.
If there is a swelling in the liver and you want to know if it is in the fatty substance of the liver or in its membranes, then it is known that if it is in the fatty substance of the liver, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the membranes of the liver, then with the pain there will be intense sharpness and I have seen that doctors have failed to treat it, so the patient should lie down on his back then apply a poultice to the swelling.
Then the flaps are protected in fire, and it is the flap which resembles the scale, and this is its form. And it is cauterized with one caustic until the skin is completely burned and ends at the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then it is treated with treatment of abscesses until it clears up.
And this type of caustic should not be used except by one who has long practiced medicine and has experienced these diseases many times through trial, then he can undertake such a work and leave it with me.
The nineteenth chapter.
In cauterization of the scrotum.
It was mentioned in the beginning that caustic is extracted from the roots of dried wild rue for the cold swelling of the scrotum, and it takes one long root as long as you can find one, and it will be as thick as a finger, then it is immersed in oil and burned in fire. Then it is cauterized with one caustic in the middle between the clavicle and the neck, two small ones slightly deviating towards the area under the pubic hair, and two large ones above the breasts in what is between the third and fourth ribs.
And two also in what is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly deviating towards the back a little, and one other in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, and three caustics from behind, one in what is between the shoulders and two on either side below the one that is in what is between the arms.
And it should not be deepened by the caustic, but rather it should be a superficial impression on the skin. Some of the ancients have mentioned that some people use an iron flap resembling a scale to protect it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the same spot as the abscess.
The matter exits as we mentioned in liver abscess, and in this case, the patient may die from his hour or be exposed to a tumor that will not cure.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
In the spleen.
If you treated the spleen disease as we mentioned in the classification and your treatment did not succeed, then the abscess is in three aspects, all of which are correct. One of them is to sew it with three or four stitches spread along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of liver stitches which we mentioned its form and there is a distance between each stitch equal to the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and it will be like the suture we mentioned in liver abscess stitching neither deep nor shallow, and the patient's position will be as if they are lying on their back.
The other aspect is in the flank, and lift the skin on the side of the spleen where the patient's flank ends, and lift the skin on the side of the spleen where the left flank ends, and your lift will be on the width of the body so that the stitches are along the length of the body.
Then you will insert the sponges well protected until they reach the skin on the other side, then you will withdraw the suture and it will be four stitches. And if you wish to sew with another suture of three sponges.
Then treat the wound site after leaving it to suppurate for many days, because it is better than all that has come before in treatment.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
In abscess of the pleura.
The suture is only effective in pleural effusion, specifically if you treated the effused patient with the treatment we mentioned in the classification and your treatment did not succeed then it is necessary to sew him four stitches around the cavity and one stitch on the diaphragm.
Another scar on the liver and another scar on the spleen and two scars behind his back between the vertebrae, one facing his chest and another facing his stomach, and the depth of the scar will be close to the thickness of the skin. Then the scar is left open for a long time.
And the patient should not be deprived of treatment after the scar, as is necessary for those concerned to hasten his recovery. The appearance of the plaster that covers his back will be like what has come before it, and the one that covers his back will be greenish.
The 22nd chapter.
In the scar of the feet and legs.
If they become inflamed in the swelling and are filled with yellow liquid, it is necessary to bind on the heel of the foot at the spot between the ankle and the calf.
And hold your hand with the plaster and do not move it then raise your hand and do not turn it back at all, for the yellow liquid will flow out and the plaster will be like that.
Then bind on the legs two scars, two in each leg, and the scar will be at the sharp end of the plaster, and the scar will be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another lower down towards the middle of the leg, and two scars on each thigh.
And leave the scar open without treatment for a long time, until liquid flows from it, then treat it with what has been mentioned.
The 33rd chapter.
In the scar of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and wetness until it weakens the holding power of the stomach and intestines, and this was treated with various treatments but did not heal, and I saw the patient possible for the scar and strong in his ability, then apply a large plaster on his abdomen. As what was mentioned earlier in the cutting of the stomach with a circular knife and four cuts around the navel, soften the edges with a gentle Samaritan knife and a piece of cotton above the fat or two.
If you see the moisture abundant and the swelling likely due to that, cut a piece on the buttocks and a piece on each part, and perhaps add two small pieces near the large one, for it is a successful treatment that will not go wrong if Allah wills.
The 24th chapter.
In the cutting of piles.
If there are chronic piles in the rectum, many or one, and they are thick, cold, or rotten fluids and treatment was done as mentioned earlier, but it did not succeed, cut an incision three pieces at the bottom of the coccyx under the table slightly curved.
And cut an incision under the navel like two fingers, and if you find that his stomach has hardened and his food is not digested and you see his face distorted, cut a large piece on the stomach as mentioned earlier and a piece on his liver. And another on his intestines with a Samaritan knife, and leave the incision open for some time then treat him until he recovers if Allah wills.
The 35th chapter.
In the cutting of ulcers.
After cutting it, if you cut the ulcer, wash the knife that resembles a millet then insert it into the same ulcer and move your hand until the knife reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood is flowing do that once or twice.
If the ulcers are many, cut each one as we described and then treat it with what is suitable from ointments until it recovers, and if you find that a piece of cotton is also large, it is more beneficial.
The 30th Chapter.
In the navel of the scrotum, and in its neighbourhoods.
If the wound does not respond to the incision and the treatment we described in its place, and you abstain from that, then perhaps it will heal by itself. But if pus or foul discharge occurs from one of the navels and wetting occurs, first you should measure it with a thin measuring string.
Then know the depth of his cavity by measurement, then take a cotton cloth that resembles a piece of linen, and insert it into the same navel on the straightness of the cavity's length and the amount the measuring string went in, and apply the kii to it until you burn away all those foul things once or twice or thrice as needed.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the navel opens into the bladder or into the intestines.
So be careful from all these places, but only do so if the navel is in a fatty area and you have determined it is not infected. Then treat the place until it heals, and if you close the place and cut off the discharge and it remains that way for some time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the discharge does not stop, know that it is infected or there is a great foul matter or something similar to what will be mentioned in its place.
The 37th Chapter.
In the kidney's calyx.
If there is pain in the kidney due to cold or severe wind and reduction of the patient's appetite, it is necessary to bind him with cloths on both sides of the same kidney, as well as on each kidney, using the medicinal cotton cloth that was mentioned earlier, and maybe a third one in the same bed so that three layers are arranged and it will be more effective for the benefit.
The Eighth and Thirty-Second Chapter.
In the Bladder.
If a weakness occurs in the bladder, and it relaxes due to coldness or moisture until it can no longer hold urine; then take a thread of Khamiyyah at the bottom of the bed on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, one thread on the right side of the bed and another on the left.
And after the thread is tightened on both sides to the extent of the fold of the groin, it should be tied at the bottom of the back or two threads if necessary; and the binding should be a little above what has been mentioned.
The Nineteenth and Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
In the Uterus.
If a material occurs in the uterus due to coldness or moisture, it will be affected by that and its contents will be corrupted and its movement will be impeded or pain will occur when it comes; therefore, three threads should be tied around the bed as we mentioned in the case of the bladder. And a thread should be tied at the bottom of the back or two threads; and the binding should be a little above what has been mentioned.
The Forty-Chapter.
In the Hernia of the Loin.
If there be moisture and mucus that threatens the loin sac, it may cause it to emerge from its place; and a sign of this is if one leg becomes longer than the other when they are applied to each other, and finding the site of the hernia a hollow space; therefore, the patient should be bound with a thread on the loin sac itself, in the shape of a circle.
After the thread is wound around the sac as it turns, so that the sac falls in the middle of the circle; and the binding which we mentioned earlier should be like this, in the case of the uterus; if this binding does not come to you, then take three threads with the large oilcloth binding.
Make the incision deep according to the thickness of all the skin then treat it until it heals if Allah wills.
The Forty-Ninth Chapter.
In the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip and its cause is cold and dampness, and you treated the ailment as mentioned earlier and the treatment did not succeed, then it becomes necessary to loosen the blockage with a hot compress or a mustard poultice or something similar.
Then bind a poultice to the incision, either with caustic medicines or with fire. The fire-caused incision will be on many faces, one of them being to cauterize the sciatic hip itself three times in this shape.
And it will have a suitable depth, and after each incision there will be a gap the width of a finger, and the poultice will be olive-like. And you can cauterize one incision in the middle on top of the hip itself, making four incisions, or if you want, use the circular instrument mentioned earlier for removing the sciatic nerve, as one incision.
So that the circle encircles all of the sciatic hip and burns through all the skin, this is the nature of the cauterization in sciatica if the pain persists only in the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize two incisions on the thigh in the place that the pain indicates is affected there, one above the sciatic notch by four fingers towards the outside slightly, and make the poultice thin and the depth of the incision only as deep as the thickness of the skin.
And if it indicates that the pain extends to about the toes, then cauterize where it has indicated to you with a poultice three or four times or more as needed, and if it indicates the pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize there one thin incision.
Guard yourself in all your acts so that you do not reach with it to the bone or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a bad condition or injury.
And I have seen one man after another whose bone was cut above the ankle and reached into the leg, until it pierced the foot and caused all of it to rot and corrupted the entire leg, then diarrhea and death followed; if the pain is in both legs similarly, their condition will be like this.
And some wise scholars have mentioned in the treatment of sciatica that they make a cauldron from iron, its diameter being half a finger's breadth, and at the mouth it is as thick as a date stone or slightly thinner; inside that cauldron there is another cauldron and yet another.
And it will be that between each cauldron there is a space equal to the width of an eyebrow, and the cauldrons are open on both sides and their height is about the length of an eyebrow or two; and for them a lid is made from iron well-fitted onto the cauldrons, this is its shape.
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red-hot, and the patient is then placed on a wooden board with the afflicted leg hanging off to the right side, and it is cauterized three times in one sitting; then it is left for three days, and it is smeared with fat and the wound is left open.
Many then treat it with an ointment until it heals, he said. This book contains this type of sciatica, we have rarely used it to cure it and its appearance is frightening, except that few find patience for it, but for those who do and are treated accordingly.
And as for the sciatica with burning medicines, it is that you make two cauldrons like a ring where mercury or iron powder is poured.
The wounds in their crevices will be about the height of two or three inches and will have a gap between them as thick as a finger. The bottom one will be open, the top one open, and some part of it will be grasped together in this shape.
Then you will place it on the curved part of the thigh and the patient lying on his healthy side, grasping your hand gently. Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which has been warmed by a little fire, and hold it for the duration of a sandy hour. The patient endures the pain and burning as if he were in a fire.
Until the pain subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the thigh completely with sweet water. Then leave it for three days and apply oil on it until the burns' darkness goes away. Leave it some more time until pus comes out, as that is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, make a compress of the same type that you used on the thigh, regardless. This is the quality of hot water and I have proven it in my treatise on the correction of medicines.
Take a part from the unslaked lime and a part from the unslaked gypsum, each one separate. Then grind them together and put them in a new container that has been hollowed out at the bottom with a small hole just big enough for the spatula to enter.
And pour on the lime and gypsum from sweet water until it covers them up to the finger, after having grasped them firmly with your hand. Then leave the container until the hot water descends into the hollowed-out part of the container. Then gather all that water together and pour it on another lump of gypsum and another lump of lime, again also.
And so it becomes very strong and active in many medical operations and for all other organs, because it does the action of fire exactly. And among medicines that treat the thigh are also Thapsia and Balaustium honey with ground gypsum mixed with soap.
Galenus narrated the story of a man from ancient times who treated a case of sciatica and lumbago. He greatly emphasized its importance and claimed that it does not require any other treatment, and that it cures once only.
Until he has entered the bath wrapped and emerged cured, and it is said to take some green saffron, if it is not found, to use dry modern saffron with something of fat and place it on the back where the pain is or in the leg or in the thigh.
And it is stretched and left for three hours or as long as the patient feels relief from the warmth, then enter him into the bath. If he becomes warm in his body, enter him into the basin. The pain goes away and cures by God's will, if not, repeat the poultice on him after ten days again.
And it cures if God wills, and know that no one should use these remedies except after purging the body. And Diascusrides mentioned that if goat's fleece is applied to lumbago, it brings benefit.
And the poultice is of this kind, it takes wool and dips it in old oil and places it on the deep place between the elbow and the wrist, which is closer to the wrist. Then take a goat's fleece that is dry.
Then heat it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished, then take another one and continue to do so until the sensation reaches through the shoulder to the back and the pain subsides by God's will, and this type of poultice is called the goat's fleece poultice.
The 42nd Chapter.
In the treatment of a backache.
The pain in the back may be due to many causes, either from a fall or blow or excessive fatigue and so on, and it is caused by accumulation of cold damp matter, and this poultice only falls into this category.
Whoever causes a cold substance to be poured on the patient, it is necessary after evacuating the patient's bowels and the like that he lies down on his back where the pain occurs, three rows wide on the same width as the table itself, after having learned the position by means of ink on each row five or more strokes according to what you see from the patient's ability and strength.
And it will be the stroke with a rounded point, or if you wish, three or four strokes with a rounded point, moderately spaced in this manner.
The Third Section and Tenth Part.
At the beginning of the incision.
This disease often afflicts young children, and its initial sign in a child is that it occurs to him difficulty of breathing when standing or moving, and one finds at the end of his vertebrae a lump has emerged protruding above all the other lumps.
If you see that and want to stop it, make a stroke with a rounded point that is circular in this shape. To take the stroke on every side of the vertebrae evenly, and if you wish, make it around the vertebra with a rounded point two or three rows, and let the points be close to each other, then treat the site until it is cleared as mentioned.
And take care that you use the stroke in the incision which is from tension of the nerve.
The Fourth Section and Forty-First Part.
In the stroke for gout and joint pains.
If the joint pains are from cold humors and settle on any part of the body, then if the pain occurs in both legs, it is usually customary among doctors to call that gout proper.
If the cold gout is not relieved by the treatment mentioned in the previous section, and the pains persist, then the stroke goes to it and that is done by making many strokes after evacuating around the joints of the legs with a rounded point moderately spaced on this shape.
If you need to puncture the man's face, do it with a pointed instrument. If the pain rises to the knees or to other joints, and this often happens, apply three or four strokes of this ointment from each side to every knee with that pointed instrument in particular.
If you need more than this stroke, apply it, but do not deepen your finger with the stroke; rather, let it be as if you are stroking the skin only. If the pain rises to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned earlier of the stroke in its place.
If the pain is only in the hands, puncture around the wrists as if you were wrapping two folds. If the pain remains in the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and at the tip of the hand, if the pain rises after days to the elbows or armpits.
Punctuate both sides and the patient will not be deprived of good treatment and taking medication, for if he eats well and expels phlegm, he will recover with this stroke, God willing.
The 45th Chapter.
In the matter of ulcers.
If an ulcer appears in the abdomen and some of the intestines or entrails descend to the genitals, and this is at the beginning, it is necessary that the patient be ordered not to eat for a day and to use what can help to evacuate the bowel from his belly.
Then he will lie down before you on his back and you will order him to hold himself until the entrails or intestines protrude, then return them with your finger. Then, learn by drawing a line under the ulcer on the bone of the hip, as if it were half a circle with its edges extending upwards along the body.
Then protect this ointment shape.
Until it becomes white and cools the inflammation, then return the entrails or intestines to his belly. Then, have a servant place his hand on the spot so that the entrails do not protrude again; I have placed a cushion between the patient's legs and another servant has tied up his legs.
And the last on his chest grasps his hands, then the retractor falls on the mark itself and your hand with the retractor stands upright and holds it until it reaches the bone or returns it once more if it does not reach the bone at first.
And conserve your effort from exposing the intestines while you are cutting, lest they be burnt and as a result either death or great harm will occur to the patient. And know that whenever you do not reach the bone with your cut, your operation will not be successful, and the retractor of children should be gentle on their bellies and for adults on theirs.
Then treat the wound with ghee after three days until the dryness of fire goes away, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
And it is necessary to make his food last throughout his treatment, so that his stomach will be easy on him, lest the intestines emerge when he urinates or defecates. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a strong bandage and keep it in place for another forty days, and gradually reduce his fatigue, thirst, eating and drinking, and loud shouting.
For if you use this treatment in this way, he will recover completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of an incision by an incision in its chapter, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the entire abdomen and was initially present, if you want to prevent it from increasing, make a circular incision around it according to its size. And let what is burned from the skin be like a third of it, then treat it as we mentioned. For it will not increase, God willing. And some earlier ones have said that one should suture the hernia with a triangular retractor in this shape.
After learning to suture the wound with thread and making the two lines, one on the upper side of the wound and the other below it, and putting your hand in the middle with great care, the first finger being easier and better if God wills.
The Forty-Eighth Section.
In the wound's depth.
If an injury occurs in some organs due to a fall or blow and the pain persists for a long time, despite treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a burning point, each finger being according to the size, smallness, weakness, and strength of each member.
And the pain and wound is removed from it, then he is freed from the first burn, otherwise, you should repeat the burning on him because these pains have a habit of transferring from one member to another nearby, therefore, you should follow them with a burn until the patient recovers.
The Forty-Seventh Section.
In the leprosy wound.
As for those suffering from leprosy, they may benefit greatly from the cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by the yellowish phlegm and blackness.
If you wish to cauterize it, look at the leprosy; if it is initial and you have treated it as mentioned in the section, and it has not subsided nor stopped, and the patient's flesh is weak and susceptible to decay, then apply five burns on the head. The first one in the middle of the head, the second one below it towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, two on the temples and one from behind on the occipital protuberance; direct your hand with the cauterizing instrument slightly until it has a slight effect on the bone.
And it will shed off scales, making it easier to exhale the thick vapors from it and cauterize it with a burn also on the same spot as mentioned earlier; but if the leprosy has continued on the patient and has shown a clear appearance, then you should apply these burns that we mentioned on the head. Placement on the nose, two placements on the cheekbones, two placements on the neck vertebrae, six on the back vertebrae, one large placement at the coccyx when the anus is empty and another above it in the same position, two on each thigh, one on each. Two on the kneecaps, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the chest straps, and one on every joint of his hands and feet.
And take care not to injure the nerve at the back of the heels, lest you cause them harm. And know that every application is more effective and safer the more you apply it.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the application as the healthy person does because his body is numb, and it is necessary to have needle thicknesses of large and small according to the parts and joints as mentioned earlier.
Then treat the application with refined honey and all other treatment until it heals, if God wills.
The 48th chapter.
When a member of the limbs becomes numb and has been treated with medicines, poultices, and bandages but did not heal, then treat that same numb member with applications according to its bone's thickness or smallness.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals, and sometimes for some numbness that appears on the hand and foot in the back vertebrae at the exit of the nerve that moves that member, then the numbness departs.
And he should not proceed with that unless he is knowledgeable about dissecting the limbs and exits of the nerves that move the body.
The Forty-Ninth Chapter.
About Gout.
If the gout persists and no remedy from the remedies of medicine is effective, then make an incision in it a little deep to the thickness of the skin until the whitish part goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with a fine paste of broad beans, mixed with rosewater, the sap of the castor oil plant, or the blood of the finch, from each one a portion, and mix all together, and apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the place until it heals.
The Fiftieth Chapter.
About Cancer.
If the cancer is newly formed and you want to stop it, then encircle it with a circular file as it rotates. And some wise men have said that one should make an incision in its center, but I do not see this, because I expect it to ulcerate and I have seen this happen on many occasions.
The correct thing is to incise around it in a circle as we said, or with multiple cuts.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
About Dropsy.
If dropsy occurs in someone and it delays in its development either due to the active humour that affects it or due to the age of the patient if he is an old man with little blood or due to time, and you want to hasten the development of the dropsy, then make many small cuts around it, pouring.
Then leave it, because it hastens in its development. If you want to remove it with a file, take care of the file that has this shape.
And lower it into the middle of the dropsy until it penetrates the skin and be like what is below, so that it may be easy to remove the pus, then treat it as needed until it heals.
The Second Fifty Chapter.
In the Matter of Food.
The ulcer is nothing but decay that eats away at the organ as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where it may catch fire, use many small and large poultices as needed for that location where there is the ulcer.
Then surround it from all sides until the decay is completely removed and nothing remains of it whatsoever. Then leave it for three days and apply the sulfur powder mixed with oil to the affected areas until all the crust and all the decay are gone.
Then treat it with soothing ointments for the flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh is growing new and healthy tissue, free from decay, otherwise reapply the treatment to what remains of the affected areas, and the ulcer can be treated with a harsh medicine.
For it is more effective with fire, and I have mentioned its treatment with harsh medicine in the previous chapter; take it from there whenever you need to.
The Third Fifty Chapter.
In the Matter of the Reversed and Unreversed Pliers.
This affliction often occurs in the soles of the feet and is something harsh that troubles the man, and the treatment for it is on two counts: either with fire or with harsh water.
As for the treatment with fire, it is that you make a small iron tool resembling an eagle's beak, which surrounds the pincer from all sides and has a thin rim. Then you place the tool on top of the pincer and turn your hand around the pincer until the tool reaches the depth of the pincer.
And leave it for three days until it forms a scab, then wrap it in powdered bread soaked in salt and leave the dressing on overnight. When morning comes, it will have separated from its roots; then treat the wound with soothing ointment for the flesh until it heals, if the pincer is not reversed.
Many times an abscess occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. Therefore, it is necessary to take a tube from copper or iron or eagle's feathers and place it on the abscess or boil, then pour into the tube a small amount of hot water.
You grasp your hand and while rotating it slightly, you make the tube's rim touch the edge of the abscess. Then the hot water finds its way into the abscess's root. The patient endures the hot water for a moment.
Then leave it alone, as the abscess bursts open at its roots. Do this with each one separately until you have treated all of them in the body. Then treat the areas after the abscesses have burst open and the flesh has been cleansed with ointments.
The Fourth Chapter Fifty.
In cases of Fistula.
If a fistula occurs due to cold on the nerve or quartan fever or any other cause, it is necessary to apply four or five compresses on the back between each compress and one in the chest. And on his abdomen, a compress with oilcloth compression, so that the fistula subsides and hastens the maturation of the cold disease.
The Fifth Chapter Fifty.
In cases of Pus in the Body.
It may break out on the body as foul boils caused by cold, thick, and rotten matter. Therefore, when they first appear, you should apply a soft compress to each boil with a stick that has been burned at one end or with the long root of the safflower plant or with an oilcloth compression.
And you should apply the poultice to the boils at their first appearance in this way, so that it does not increase and the pus-producing discharge is dissipated from it, and the patient becomes free of it, except that this should happen after the patient has been purged with phlegm.
The 50th chapter.
In the event of bleeding that occurs when cutting a vein.
Blood from a severed artery often flows copiously when an external wound is inflicted or when a tumor or limb is divided, and it becomes difficult to cut.
So, if that happens to someone, hasten with your hand to the mouth of the artery and place your thumb on it tightly until the blood is stopped under your thumb and nothing comes out from it. Then, take a small or large olive pit, whichever you have available, and hold it over the fire until it becomes very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the location where the artery was cut, and place it on the same vein after removing your thumb with ease and hold the olive pit until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding starts again when you lift your thumb from the mouth of the artery and stop applying the olive pit, take another olive pit with ease from the ones in the fire that are prepared and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn the surrounding tissue, as this may cause another wound on the patient. And know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be cut, especially if the artery is large, except through one of four openings, either by ligating as we said, or by cauterizing if it has not been severed. And if it is cauterized, its ends will shrink and the bleeding will stop. Either wrap it tightly with threads or apply medications that can cut off the bleeding and bind it securely with ligatures.
And as for someone who attempts to cut it with a ligature or bind it tightly with a compress or apply burning substances and so on, then that will not stop the bleeding at all except in rare cases; if anyone has done this without a doctor's attention or remedy, let him first place his thumb on the mouth of the wound itself as we described.
You compress the wound extremely until the blood congeals and drips from above the wound onto the artery and finger, and it does not come away from him with cold water always, until the blood freezes and thickens and stops. In that moment you look to see what it needs in terms of poultice or medicine.
The Second Chapter.
In the incision, the excision, the lance wound and similar injuries.
He said: What we mentioned in the first book regarding every disease that requires cauterization and burning medicine, its causes, reasons and instruments, and illustrations of surgical procedures, I have divided into chapters from the beginning to the end.
And I follow in this chapter that same path so as not to make it difficult for the student what is required of him.
Before I begin with that, oh my sons, you should know that this chapter contains some of the things that are above what is in the first book on cauterization.
And for that reason, it is necessary to warn against it strongly because the work in this chapter is great and often falls into wasting blood which is the source of life when opening a vein or incision on a tumor or abscess or surgical treatment or extracting a splinter or cutting open a stone and similar things that accompany all these dangers and fears, and result in most of them in death.
And I warn you against falling into what is uncertain, for indeed there are types of people in this craft who are afflicted with various diseases, and some of them become weary of their illness and succumb to death.
Due to the severity of their illness and the length of their suffering, and because the disease has taken a turn for the worse, which indicates death, and some of them spend their wealth on you and pay your fees in the hope of regaining their health, and their illness becomes a struggle; therefore, it is not right for you to abandon those who are in this state.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and zeal, and do not proceed with anything from that unless you are certain of the outcome that will bring glory to you. And use in all treatment of your patients the principle of knowledge and warning about what will lead to salvation.
For you have in that a means to acquire praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God guide you, my sons, to righteousness and prevent you from error and success; for that is in His Hand, there is no god but He.
And I have organized this chapter into sections, as mentioned earlier in the section on wounds, from head to toe, so that you may quickly find what you are looking for, if God wills.
The First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Water that Assembles on the Heads of Children.
This disease is often presented to children at birth if the mother presses the child's head without care, and it may also be caused by a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this condition in anyone except children, and all that I have seen of them die from it. Therefore, I saw fit to leave the treatment of it alone, and I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grows larger every day. Until the child cannot sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increases until he dies.
And this moisture is either gathered between the skin and the bone or beneath the bone on the peritoneum. If the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, about two hands' breadth long, until the moisture is drained; this is the picture of the trephine.
If the moisture increases and the swelling becomes greater, then make two crossing incisions like this:
And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see the stitches of the head opened from all directions and the water sinks when you press it with your hand to the inside, it does not matter; therefore, you should cut in the middle of the head three incisions in this shape.
And after the incision, all the moisture will come out, then you should close the incisions with sutures and bandages, then wash it from above with vinegar and oil until the fifth day, then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with poultices and ointments, and do not leave the head bound moderately, and feed the patient with all dry food little moisture.
Until the member is strong and healed, another method of incision is to look where the bone of the tumor appears and the gathering of water, because it may be in the back of the head more or in the front or in the right or in the left.
So aim at the incision where the tumor appears and the gathering of water, and make an incision as much as you can, and be careful not to cut a vein so that bleeding occurs and the patient dies from that bleeding with the moisture expelled.
The second chapter.
Cutting the two veins behind the known ears.
When someone experiences a sudden attack to the eyes or chest and no relief is obtained through medicine, then inform that the treatment in this case is cutting these two veins.
It is necessary if you want to cut them that you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then roughen the place with a coarse cloth so that the veins appear, then bind the patient's neck with his own cloth, and look where the pulsation of sweat and their two hidden places are located behind the ears, except in some people.
Then learn their course with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel cuts up to the bone and it will be that way around the head; if you wish, you can enter the scalpel from under the vein and push it upwards along the cut and the length of the cut will be about two folded fingers.
If the artery is severed, blood will exit with a pulsating flow and flow forward, stopping at the anterior and posterior. If the vein does not appear to be palpable, it is necessary to measure from the ear by three fingerbreadths then learn with ink and cut to the bone, which should.
Blood will flow seven or eight fingerbreadths downstream and perhaps a little more or less, all of which is according to the strength of the sufferer and the fullness of his veins. Then look at the wound; if anything remains on the bone from theomentum, cut it off.
So that a hot abscess does not form, then bind the wound with a thread from a torn cloth and treat it with ointments until it is cured.
The third chapter.
The two arteries in the armpits.
If a person has chronic sciatica or sudden attacks of sharp pains in the muscles of the armpits, or severe and prolonged headache and the like, and was treated with various medical remedies but did not benefit from that, then we have tried to ligate the arteries at the armpits or cauterize them as we described.
And the method of ligation is to shave the sufferer's hair in the armpits and direct the artery that appears on the surface of the armpit, for it will become evident to you from its pulse, except in some individuals.
Or if the cold is intense, and it is not evident to you, then have the sufferer tighten their shoulder with the help of a cloth, and then search for the place with a piece of cloth or wet the place with warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the forceps that has this shape. Then take the forceps and peel away the skin gently until you reach the artery, then insert a ligature into it and pull it up until you can bring it out of the skin and free it from any adhesions underneath in all directions. If the artery is thin, tie it off with the edge of the ligature. Then a portion is cut off from it as much as its sides are apart and it constricts without causing bleeding, for if it does not get cut or torn, the blood will not flow at all. Then drain out six or three qata' of blood.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to suture it in two places with a strong double thread, either of silk or flax, so that decay does not occur before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Then cut off as much as is between the ligatures, do this at that time or later, and if you wish to shape it so that it adheres to the bone with a chisel-like instrument until its edges are trimmed, thus making this operation identical or even better as we said.
Unless the patient is feverish or in a bad mood, for the ligature ensures the elimination of moisture and makes it stronger for the benefit. Then after closing the arteries, fill the place with absorbent cotton and put on it the compressed linen, and after that treat with herbal medicines that promote flesh growth and with poultice until he is cured, if Allah wills.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your operation, hasten to cut it off either with a ligature or by filling the place with cotton and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If nothing of that is available, press your finger until the blood coagulates.
And fill the place with cold water until the pain subsides and tightens it as needed. And what is lighter and easier than closing the artery is to shape the skin with this chisel-like instrument after the two places have been made ready with a ligature.
And bring it down firmly until it reaches the bone and the skin is cut off in two places so that what is between its edges may be separated, for it will not adhere to this ligature at all, and this is the appearance of the chisel.
The edges of the two knives are similar to small points, except that they are much less sharp because if they were as sharp as the knife, it would freeze faster and the flesh would not be cut quickly. If there is some thickness in them, they will hold up well to the heat.
I cut the flesh quickly, and this work is better than all works, lighter and easier. And let there be between the two knives a thickness equal to the tip of the finger.
The Fourth Section.
Treatment for constant and continuous bleeding from the eyes.
If the tears are constant and the bleeding comes from the veins on the back of the head outside, and nothing is benefiting in treating with medicine or remedy, and I have seen the face of the patient has turned red. And he feels in his forehead a throbbing like the throbbing of ants, and his eyes are drooping, wet, and have shriveled up their lashes and grown together from the intensity of the tears. And those who treat him resort to this practice and call it the treatment with the sword, which is that you order the patient to shave off the hair on his forehead.
Then, on the forehead, you make three parallel incisions along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingerbreadths long, in line with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one a little away from the movement of the muscle that is in the cheek, and the third one on the other side.
And you take care to avoid cutting the arteries that are on both sides, and keep your hand away from joining the jawbones. After each incision, there should be a distance of three folded fingers, and have with you many sponges or cloths ready to absorb the blood as it flows.
Then the surgeon inserts the sharp instrument into both sides, this is its shape. From the incision which follows the cheek to the middle incision and stripping away all the skin between the two incisions along with the peritoneum on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and this probe will come out. And another instrument is inserted into the first incision, called a sharp scissor-like tool from one side and a blunt one from the other side, and this is its form:.
And its sharp side is directed upwards towards the attached flesh and its blunt side towards the bone, and it is pushed until it reaches the middle incision and cuts all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the outer skin.
Then that is done in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, the places where the blood vessels were cut are squeezed out and then in each incision a wick made of cotton or linen dipped in wine, vinegar, or oil is placed.
So that a hot abscess does not form, and on the third day the bandage is removed and the incision is washed with plenty of cold water then it is treated with cerate made from rose oil and all that surgeons treat with until it heals if God wills.
The Fifth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Tears and Discharges to the Eyes from within the Head.
When it happens to someone that there are many sharp and continuous discharges, and you see the eyes from which they flow to be small and puffy, and their sight weakens and the eyelids become inflamed and the lashes fall out. And there is sharp and severe pain in the head, accompanied by a persistent cough; from this symptom you understand that those materials and discharges come from many deep and extensive vessels; and the best treatment for it is this treatment, which is to order the patient to blow their nose then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is sharp and severe pain in the head, accompanied by a persistent cough; from this symptom you understand that those materials and discharges come from many deep and extensive vessels; and the best treatment for it is this treatment, which is to order the patient to blow their nose then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. I lift it slightly with the exposure and begin to cut from the left cheekbone to the right cheekbone, making the incision up to the bone. I keep my hand away from the movable muscles of the cheek when chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood has been removed with a sponge.
I separate the lips of the wound with a piece of cotton or a linen thread, then pull it from above with a ligature and moisten the ligature with wine and oil so that no inflammation occurs. When I have finished and seen that the inflammation has subsided, it is necessary to scrape away the bone until new flesh begins to grow.
Then I treat it with the dried preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts from fine emmer and four parts from sycamore, mixing them together to make a poultice, and using it for promoting flesh growth in wounds like this.
The Sixth Chapter.
Treatment of What Falls into the Ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone or semi-stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, like mustard and dates; or something liquid, like water and vinegar.
Or a living thing. If something like a stone or a fragment of a stone falls into the ear and does not increase in size inside the ear, then receive sunlight on the ear. If you see only the stone, put some purple pitch or ceruse within it, then try to remove it by moving the head or using a catheter. Seal the nostrils when the patient has a fit of sneezing after putting a bandage around the ear made of linen or wool and stretching it upwards. Many times this treatment causes it to come out, but if not, try to remove it with the soft sponge that is its likeness.
If it emerges by the wound and not, then try to remove it with a gentle and slight bending forceps. If it does not come out with that, and not, then make a tube from copper and put the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Close the area around the tube with a tightly packed plug of grease so that there is no path for the wind except through the tube. Then pull it out with your breath, pulling strongly and repeatedly, for it often comes out like this. If it does not come out as we described, and not, then take some soap from the Nabataeans or refined soap which birds are taken with something small, and put it in the end of the tube.
After wrapping it tightly with a firm thread, then put it into the ear canal gently after the ear has dried from moisture. If it does not come out as we described, then proceed to the incision before swelling or congestion occurs.
The incision recipe is that the patient should be seated in a comfortable position or first, and then blood will flow out according to their strength. Then have the patient sit facing you, turn their ear upwards, and make a small incision in the origin of the ear at the lowest part of it.
And the incision will be crescent-shaped until it reaches the earring, then remove it with what instruments you can, and then sew up the incision as quickly as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that falls into the ear is one of the grains that grows and swells, try to remove it as we described. If you are not able to get it out, then take a thin and gentle forceps in this shape.
And try to cut that kind of grain that has fallen into the ear with this forceps, but only do so if you are certain that that grain has become fixed in the ear canal until it becomes small pieces, then remove them with a blind forceps or gentle extraction or by scraping.
As we mentioned, it is made easy to remove it. As for the water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the physician to use a syringe with kohl first, and then fill his ear with something of cotton wool while lying on that ear where there is water; if he comes out by doing so.
Or it takes many small stones from the length of the fingers, smooth ones, and warms them slightly with fire; then the physician takes one from there and inserts it into a hole in his ear, steps on one foot from that direction, and strikes another stone against the one in the ear.
He does not stop doing that with one stone after another until all the water comes out, and sometimes the water comes out by taking a piece of ice or a feather, and inserting one end into the ear and burning the other end with fire until most of it is burned, then using another feather.
He does that several times until all the water comes out or draws it with a tube as mentioned earlier, and as for removing the animal that is inside, look; if it is small like lice and the like, treat it as mentioned in the division.
If its body is large, it will be perceived by the sense; try to remove it with a pumice stone and tweezers, and make it easier than all that settles in the ear. And as for removing the worms produced in the ear if you treated them as mentioned in the division in the chapter on worms, but your treatment did not succeed.
So look at the ear in the sun; if something of the worms appears to you, remove it with a pumice stone or fine tweezers. If nothing appears to you from it, take this tube and make an image of it.
The lower part is narrow and the upper part is wide, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the physician can manage it then grasp it firmly do that several times until all the worms come out; if they do not come out for you, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you in the stones.
If it does not come out as mentioned, then use the quturats which we have mentioned and the early ones used in killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on quturats. Mix your potions and medicines into the ear with this instrument; and this is its shape:.
As you see, it is made from brass or a narrow piece of copper; there is a small hole at the bottom and a larger one at the top. If you wish, make the cannon inside the tube from firmly attached copper; if not, take a thread, wrap it tightly around the end.
Then pour the fat, juice, or whatever medicine you want into the tube which is in the ear. Then insert the thread with a cotton thread from above and press it gently with your finger until the fat flows into the auditory canal and can be felt.
With the ailing person inside, and what you poured into the ear having been warmed slightly in fire. And beware that whatever is trickling there is not extremely cold or hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
The Seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Obstruction in the Ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs and ears unperforated.
And also, some people may have an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh that has grown there, and this obstruction can be deep within the ear canal and not visible to the eye.
And also, some people may have an obstruction that protrudes slightly outside the canal and is visible to the eye. As for what protrudes deep within the ear and is not visible to the eye, it is usually difficult to cure. But as for what protrudes and can be seen, it is necessary to place the patient's ear in the sun. And look at it carefully; if you see the obstruction clearly, then open it with a thin forceps and this is its shape:.
The edges of the wound will have some slight exposure, some being limited and the rest being smoother on both sides so that it does not harm the ear. If the scab has formed over the flesh in the ear canal, hold it with a fine forceps and cut it off with great gentleness until all the flesh is removed.
If the scab is in the depth of the ear, take a thin and flat mica, smooth it out, heat it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the scab with what the patient experiences as heaviness of hearing, remove it gently.
And take care not to injure the ear canal. Then place a wick in the ear according to the size of the hole, moistening it with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are certain that the wound is healed or take a wick and dip it in water and sprinkle powdered gum on it.
And use it. If you see the ear has become inflamed and warm, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another one that has been moistened in rose fat until the inflammation subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all the treatment that stops this type of bleeding as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of ulcers which occur in the eyelids.
These ulcers that occur in the eyelids can be wet and dry. It is necessary to grasp them with a forceps or fine forceps and cut them off with a scalpel from their roots, then apply powdered gum to the area.
If bleeding occurs from it, stop it with a gentle bean-shaped pessary and bind it tightly after the cutting and often it will close if something remains of its roots. And if bound with fire, that root will be burnt up and not remain.
The Ninth Chapter.
Treatment of Prolonged Chill in the Eye Joints.
Often something resembling a chill appears in the eye joints in its severity and stubbornness.
And thus it is called a chill, being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and lower eyelid. The treatment is to look into it; if the chill appears prominent on the surface of the eyelid, it can be divided by an incision made from above.
Then remove it from all sides gently until it is freed, then tie it up with a ligature and cut it off. If you are unable to cut it off except after the eyelid has been severed by the cutting, do not harm the patient thereby; if the incision is large, sew it up and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, do not worry about it; the poultice will heal it and cover it. If the chill is leaning towards the inside of the eyelid towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid over and tie the chill with a ligature without needing an incision, and remove it from all sides.
And if the eyelid is severed by the cutting, it will not harm that; then wash the eye after cutting off the chill with saltwater and treat the site with what heals until the patient recovers.
The Tenth Chapter.
Treatment of Stye Which Appears in the Eyelid of the Eye.
The stye is a pustule that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid and more commonly appears on children, who are afflicted by it and suffer from night blindness, unable to gaze at the light of the sun. In order for tears to rush to them.
Therefore, they are always leaning on their faces and sleeping with them, and their eyelids become moist beneath the eyebrows due to the stench of the stye, which becomes apparent to the eye. When you press the spot with your fingers, you will feel the stye between them; and the treatment is for the patient to place his head in a stone.
Then take a piece of cotton cloth and prepare it. Make a tail from it and make a circle with it, as big as the hernia is from all sides. Then place it on it and compress it with your fingers from all sides to gather the hernia in the middle of the circle.
Then cut in the middle of that moisture with a blunt instrument, cutting it straight across and not making the cut larger than the one that is in the cicatrix. As for its depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the hernia.
In most cases, the hernia will protrude from the cut in the form of a white fatty piece. You then draw it out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your fingers and bring it outside while turning your hand to the right and left until it is reduced. And beware not to increase the cut lest the blunt instrument touches the eye and injures it.
If the hernia does not appear to you at first in the cut, then you should increase it slightly with care until the hernia appears. Then draw it out as we said and immerse a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the place and bind it tightly. Some people crush salt.
And place it in the depth of the cut so that what remains of that moisture dissolves, then take care of it until it heals. If an ulcer forms in the place, treat it with gentle poultices until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In kinds of eye inflammation.
If a growth appears in the eyelid, extra lashes growing outside of their natural course beneath the natural lashes and falling off, then it harms the eye and causes various kinds of diseases such as continuous tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whitening, thickening until that becomes a reason for the destruction of the eye.
And eye inflammation is in four ways, either by fire or by the sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on medicine. Or it can be caused by cutting and sewing or with papyrus as I remember.
You should place the head of the eyelid on your stone then turn the eye's lid with your left hand. If it does not flip over, then insert a needle into it from below the eyelid and push the needle through the thread from above, having that be near the same location as the hair itself, and pull the thread up onto the eyelid.
You should turn it over with the forceps then cut in the inner corner of the eyelid, avoiding the excess hair, using a curved needle from the larger to the smaller conjunctival sac. Then you should tie the thread and place a small cotton or linen strip under the eyelid, and learn on the eyelid with the styptic.
Like the shape of a sycamore leaf, but it is necessary for the shape to be according to what you want in terms of elevating the eyelid because people may differ in that, so some may need you to cut from the eyelid as much as the eyelid has relaxed.
And some may need less of all that according to the relaxation of the eyelid, then you should cut with the forceps on both lines you learned and start from the larger conjunctival sac to the smaller one, and the single incision will be near natural hair, like the thickness of a reed.
Then you should insert the suture into one of the corners of the skin, then remove it all and gather by sewing the eyelids together with a fine wool thread and needle, wipe away the blood, and secure what remains of the threads on the eyebrows with some stuck-on things if.
You may do that or not, as you please, then the suture and threads will remain for about three or four days, then treat it, and if you wish, leave the wound without suturing and treat it with what dries and contracts, because the eyelid rises when the wound is closed and the suture is better.
This is a face of the flesh incision mentioned by the earliest ones, except that it has an obligation on the patient and is one of good deeds without danger in it. And another face in the flesh incision also, namely to learn from the eyelid a shape like the shape of the tamarisk leaf as we described. Then the eyelid is raised with three hooks that are scattered or grouped in this form:.
Then what remains of the eyelid is cut off with a small scissors in this manner, cuts being made moderately:.
If you cannot hold the hooks and it is not suitable for you, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, insert another thread nearby the larger curve, and another thread nearby the smaller curve, and gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then lift it up gently.
And lift up the skin that has been incised on it entirely as we described, then gather the edges of the wound with stitches and heal it until it is cured. If an inflammation or abscess appears at your cutting or incising, treat that inflammation with poultices and similar soothing remedies.
And if the lower eyelid also becomes disfigured, it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of incisions, stitches, and cauterization with medicine, or cauterization or medicine, more and more carefully and lightly on the patient, taking into account what has been done in this case.
Cauterization with papyrus is done in this manner: that you turn the eyelid and make a cut inside as we have described, then make two or three small incisions along the length of the eyelid and narrower than a hairbreadth.
And then the edges of both are cut off from both sides, where the threads hold on, and then they are brought together gently onto what remains of the eyelid, and the incisions are tightened firmly from both sides, and it is left for some days; for the tightened skin dies, becomes gangrenous, and putrid.
Until it falls from its place, then hasten to extract it with a pincer and treat it until it is healed. If the swelling subsides, the eyelid rises and the lashes of the eye do not protrude, this shape and size are made for the tongs in length and width exactly:.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In raising the grown-out hair from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the work in that is to take a thin needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, smooth and then gather its ends together and tie them with a very delicate knot, and let the length of the thread be about an inch.
Then you will wrap around the threads another thread, a thin one, and tie its ends if you wish. Then the operator will place his head near your stone, as close to the sun as possible, so that he may see what he is doing, for it is a precise work. Then the needle enters into the bundle in the root of the excess hair.
And it will thread it through the eyelid with a needle until it comes out above the natural hair, then it will pull the thread up to above the bundle and enter into that bundle, whether one or two or three hairs.
Then you will pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the bundle in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pulled the bundle and the hair did not come out with it, you will pull the bundle down with the thread that you wrapped around it until the bundle comes out of the upper hole.
Then you will put the hair back in its place and pull it until it comes out with the bundle, doing that until it rises to the upper hole and is visible to the eye. Then loosen the bundle and thread, and bring them out, and then compress the eye and leave it compressed for two or three days until the hair stays in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either you add to it a long hair from natural hair and it rises with it or leave it until it lengthens after some time when it rises.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the treatment of the pustule which occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The one exposed to this pustule is called Arnbiya and this pustule will be either natural or acquired, and the acquired one will be from an injury or a blow or a scratch or something like that.
The method of treatment is to cut that inflammation and separate its edges and insert a thread of cotton between them and tie it until it heals, and it should not be treated with things that dry and constrict.
If you do that, the pustule will return worse than it was, so use things that loosen like soap and water mixed with gum arabic and a little of the Diakhilum ointment, and apply it to the affected area.
The key to its treatment is to use every means possible so that it does not adhere to the original condition, and this method we mentioned is only some repair of the pustule, not that the place will return as it was at first.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the treatment of the pustule which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This pustule which is in the lower one is the one that is called Shtra and it will be either natural or acquired, and the acquired one will be from an injury or a blow or a scratch or something like that.
The method of treatment is to take a thread and tie it around the pustule, then insert an awl on either side of the pustule and push it through until the thread appears at both ends, then raise the pustule above with the awl and cut it off with a broad thumb.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is proper, but otherwise; take a reed and place it on the position of the incision and turn it with the eyelid and cut two flaps in the inner side of the eyelid, and the edges of the flaps will be at the angles of the cuts until they meet and form an angle. Until it meets, it will become like this shape.
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is lower than what is next to the eyelid, then gather the separated parts with two stitches and sew it with a wool thread, then treat it with the medicines we mentioned earlier until it heals.
And if the wound is exposed from an incision or stitching or cutting, it is necessary to cut a small incision without hair on the eyelid also as mentioned earlier, then separate the lips with ointment as described.
And the sum of the statement in treating the wound whether from above or below is to work according to what appears to you about the shape of the wound, for it may be many in its appearance, and the skilled craftsman arranges the technique in any way possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approaches it, and the same disease guides you about what is suitable for it in most cases.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the adhesion of the eyelid to the palpebra or to the conjunctiva.
This adhesion may expose many people to the eyelid above being attached to the white of the eye, preventing it from moving easily and impeding its natural functions, so it is necessary for you to insert a reed under the eyelid.
And lift it up or straighten it with a thread then cut the adhesion with a fine knife not being too harsh to cut off the knife so as not to disturb the operator and let the knife fall gently on the eye, and your cutting will be like peeling off that adhesion.
Until the eyelid returns to its natural state and all adhesion is resolved, then wash the eye with saltwater or instill in it a solution of black myrrh dissolved in water. Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a piece of cotton thread.
She puts a soaked wool cloth moistened with egg white over the eye, and after the third day she uses medicated threads until it heals.
The Sixteenth Chapter.
In cutting the fingernail and removing the nail bed.
The nail is either brittle and resembles a thin, hard scale, or it is non-brittle and resembles a white, solidified moisture, if touched with iron or taken by force with pincers, it will break.
And if a pincer does not stick, both types begin from the larger nail bed and gradually grow until they cover the gaze and prevent light and eye movement, and the method of cutting it is for the operator to place his head on a block.
Then he opens his eyes and raises the eyelid with your hand, then you pick up the nail with a slightly curved pincer, stretch it upwards, then take a needle, enter a hair from horse or cow hair and strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly and insert it in the middle of the nail.
And push it with the needle, tie the nail with the thread, stretch it upwards and strip off the side of the nail next to the pupil as if you were spreading it with a hair to its end, then cut the rest at the root of the nail bed with a thin pair of scissors or a small trimming tool and leave the natural nail bed.
So that the cut nail does not expose a constant flow of tears, and the nail can be stretched with a pincer alone or with thread as we said, then strip off the smooth edge on one side like this:
Be cautious not to touch the operator with the gauze, for if so, a festering would occur in it and the pupils would be narrowed, then after the cutting, something like powdered salt or crushed zanzibar stone would be found in the eye and it is left until the next day then treated as necessary so that it heals.
If the ulcer is not inflamed and you are unable to insert a needle or attach a catheter into it, this type of ulcer is often treated with medicines so that it heals as I described in the classification. And if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, soft, and weak-edged scalpel according to this shape:. Gently remove the scab from above, using a soft and gentle touch. If you see it cracking and falling apart, apply to the eye some crushed zanzibar stone or red ochre powder or powdered salt and close the eye until the next day.
Then redo the work until all of them are gone, except if there is a hot swelling in the eye; leave it and treat the swelling until it heals, then redo the work with the scab until it heals, and as for the meat that remains.
If the remnant is causing intense pain to the eye, tie off that remnant with a catheter and cut some of it off, but do not concentrate on the cutting so as not to cause bleeding then apply red ochre or zanzibar stone powder to the area until it heals.
The Seventeenth Section.
In cutting the redness and what grows from excess flesh in the eye.
In some people's eyes, excess flesh may grow red and accumulate to cover the surface of the eye or approach it or overflow onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids may turn outward and resemble a pomegranate.
The operation involves the patient placing their head on a stone, then opening their eyes and tearing off all that red flesh with suitable tweezers.
Or he should grasp it with a pumice stone or gauze, then cut the flesh little by little until all of it is cut off and take care not to hurt his eye while working, and your cutting tool will be either the one we described for cutting toenails or a small scissors. As is done with the folds of skin according to what appears in this chapter.
Then, if your cutting is complete and all the redness has gone, wash the eye with crushed salt or sprinkle red camphor and similar medicines into it, and apply a thread of egg white on top from outside to prevent inflammation.
If there remains any redness and the bleeding is severe, causing inflammation to occur, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the inflammation, then return to it after it has healed and perform the operation again on the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
Unless you should avoid treating any weak eye through cauterization or exposure to the operation with iron, and do not put your hand into anything of this kind until you see that that organ is capable of undergoing that operation.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On Removing the Folds from the Eye.
The folds are red veins that form on the eye, preventing sight and causing the eye to become weak with time. It is necessary for you first to examine whether the eye containing the folds is strong and not affected by any other disease except for the folds.
So then the operation is to order the patient to place their head on a stone, then tie those veins with one or two tweezers as per your skill, and the tweezers will be gentle in their curvature.
There are two double sutures in one body according to this picture:.
Then take a gentle pincer and gently grasp those veins softly, and wipe the blood sometimes after a while until you see the vein has gone from it and the bleeding stops. Take care not to hurt the eye with the edges of the pincer. Do your work halfway through the day in the shade.
And be very steadfast in your work, lest you cut something other than those veins. When you finish, apply the green or red eye salve to the eye, as much as it needs, to consume what remains of the blood. If you are unable to remove all of it at that time, compress the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye.
And leave it for some days until the pain subsides and the swelling recedes. Then do the work again on this condition with the same eye, until this picture of the pincers is freed from it.
And leave it [and the pupil of the one who is being operated on should be in the stone of the apprentice, and the other should dry up the blood, and achieve a view in the front and back of the eye, and you] the original state of the work that the eye opens with fixed or triangular openings, held by the apprentice.
Painful and the pupil of the one who is being operated on should be in the stone of the apprentice, and the other should dry up the blood, and achieve a view in the front and back of the eye, and you by choice start to grasp from above the eye or from below it. The first way is to have two sutures in the upper eyelid, one at the end and the other at the beginning.
And take hold of it between the middle and the corner, then tie a knot from under them. Then take hold of it between the nostril and the cheek, and pull your hand with a light movement until you see that all the vessels have risen. Cut from the smaller western one with pincers or forceps gently.
You are to heal the wound on the arm and to make all ways until it rises above the swelling, but do not cut the flesh, for then tears and blood will flow upon you.
Then cut with the pincers what is above and below the tendons, until there remains only a slight swelling in the armpit. For if you can lift it from the armpit, flay with the wound, this is better, and sometimes it will come away in some people.
And if you cut it, it will swell up for several days, causing pain and inflammation, then attend to it again.
The Nineteenth Section.
On the Return of the Cartilage to the Nose.
Physicians call the cartilage nasura. If they treat it with vinegar or hot medicine as described earlier, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it except to incise on the swelling when it hardens and extract all the moisture that is in it or pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see decay or rottenness, then scrape it with this instrument as follows:.
And it is called the rasor. It is made from Indian steel and its head is rounded like a razor, with an engraving of the cooled or ash-colored metal in fine lines. Then you put it on the spot where the decay is on the bone, then turn it between your fingers as you grip your hand slightly until you feel that decay has been removed.
And do that several times, then press the spot with dried and sticking medicines. If the wound is sealed and the flesh grows in its place, and the flow of pus ceases after forty days, and there is no fresh swelling or event happening in it.
So know that it has healed, and otherwise there is no remedy except to return the cartilage to the nasal orifice in this way, which is to expose the bone again with steel or hot medicine. If the bone is exposed, then take a drill as follows:.
The edge of the chisel will be triangular and its end will be conical, bent towards the side as you see it. Then place it on the bone itself, being that close to the joint and a little further away from the eye. Then bring your hand with the forceps until the bone is pierced and the patient feels it.
That the breath comes out from him if he holds his hand on his nose. Then, when the flesh grows and the place hardens, what was positioned outside will return to the nose, so it will be less painful for the patient, God willing.
The Twentieth Chapter.
Regarding the Return of Sight.
If the eye is opened with its whole contents and there is no defect or diminution in the sight, then the patient should be eased, then freed from the bandage, then have a soft cloth put on the back of the head without any constraint.
Then place on the eye a poultice made of aqua, vinegar, gallnut, and aloeswood. Then tie the eye from above with the compress, using many benefits. The recipe for the benefits is to take a lot of thin sheets, each one folded into four thicknesses, making many of them.
Then place one on top of another as much as the eye needs, then tie it with a strong and thick bandage and repeat the compressing with a soft cloth without constraint. Then remove the compress and leave the eye tied for a day and a night.
If the bandage relaxes during that time, then it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, but if not, then repeat the compressing, using many benefits, tightening, and compressing until it returns.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
About cutting the tendons.
If a hernia appears in the tendinous layer, then it bulges out and protrudes outside the abdominal walls like a tendinous fold and destroys the appearance of the human body because of this, I wish to cut it as I will describe.
And it is that you insert a needle into the origin of the tendon from below to above, then another needle with a double thread from the opposite side and push it through and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the spot where the double thread is bent, and tie some of the tendon around the needle and pull it tightly then withdraw the needle and apply a wet piece of white linen to the eye until the threads fall off with the tendon then treat the eye as it requires.
Until the wound heals, and the tendon may be tightened from all sides in a circular shape with a piece of cloth until the eye becomes swollen tightly then wrap it with a thin bandage that reaches to the bottom of the eye and the white moisture flows down and subsides then tighten it until it heals.
The 22nd chapter.
In treating a cleft.
This condition which is called a cleft is nothing but a swelling that appears in the eye resembling running water, and the purpose of treatment is for the patient to sit on a raised chair standing upright then take hold of his head with your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the swelling go down to the bottom of your eye, then stop and do not let it move, and the sight will return and the patient will see things as he used to, and if it does not descend to the bottom as we have mentioned.
And otherwise, have the patient sit in front of you then take a thin bandage and cut it with the ligament above the corneal membrane slightly at the point where the ligament joins the corneal membrane in the eyelid until the matter emerges.
If only a drop of hot water came out of the eye, which has been mixed with opium or water that has been boiled with gall and opium, then it is treated with all other treatments until it clears.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
We have mentioned the kinds of water in the classification, and which one is suitable for use as a cupping treatment with detailed explanation; then you take it from there according to what is proper. When that happens, the patient should sit before you, elevated opposite the light, near the sun.
And you bind the healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise the eyelid of that eye with your left hand if it is the left eye with water, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you put the tip of the cupping vessel near the eyelid with a slight inclination towards the smaller corner of the white part of the eye, then push the cupping vessel with force and turn it with your hand until it penetrates into the white part of the eye and feel the cupping vessel that it has reached something hollow.
And it is necessary that the cupping vessel goes as far as the depth of the eye's socket, which is from the white part to the end of the pupil, and the copper will be seen by the observer because of the transparency of the conjunctival mucosa; then the cupping vessel comes out to the top to the position where there is water.
Then you press it downwards once or twice, and if the water comes out from its source, then the patient will see what has opened up before him, and the cupping vessel is in his eye; then he rests a little, and if the water rises, then bring it down again without letting the cup go out.
If it settles and does not rise, then take out the cupping vessel gently with your hand little by little, then dissolve something of pure salt or Andirani in the water and wash the eye from inside; then put on the outside of the eye all of it, whether it is a cloth or a wet cloth.
We bind the white of egg and pure white with it, and then we tie it with the healthy eye. As for us and people of our time, we put on it a tied-up white of egg, in case the hardened one does not permit entry into the eye because some people's eyes are very hard indeed. It is necessary for the surgeon who is called the physician to take this shape:.
Then insert the point only into the severed part, and do not dwell on the puncture, but rather reach for the hardened one in a gentle spot then enter the hardened one as we mentioned, and when you complete your work prepare the patient lying down firmly sleeping on their back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and coughing, and makes his food as natural as possible without stirring his head to the right or left whatsoever, and the bandage remains on him until the third day then remove it in that dark room and try out his sight.
And he will experience things then the bandage returns to the seventh day and it is not necessary to do that during treatment or after the puncture from your time but rather avoid it before the water rises quickly with severe vision.
If a hot tumor appears it is necessary to open the eye before the seventh day and treat that which calms the tumor until it subsides then you can release his sight and place a cloth on his face training his sight from underneath for days while he is in that dark room then.
He exits the room gradually and behaves in his surroundings, and know that the puncture is not sufficient for the learned one without observation repeated times then he proceeds to the work, and I have been told by some Iraqis that they said that he makes in Iraq a wide puncture which absorbs water.
And I have not seen anyone in our land make that nor read it in a book of the early ones and it may be something new, and this is an image of types of punctures for him to stand on its ignorance:.
The manufacture of this instrument is from copper and its tip is made with a special shape like a triangular sharp edge.
Chapter Twenty-Fourth.
In the treatment of flesh that has grown in the nose.
It may grow in the nose various kinds of flesh, some resembling many-legged scorpions, and some being a cancerous tumor turned black, and some being loose and not discolored.
As for the flesh that is not cancerous or malignant, the patient should sit in front of you facing the sun and open their nostrils and receive the forceps into that flesh then pull it out to the outside and cut off what has been grasped with a thin sharp knife from one direction.
Until you are certain that all the flesh has gone, if some remains and you were unable to cut it off, remove it gently with one of the soft instruments until nothing remains; but if blood flows or a hot abscess appears.
So treat it as necessary or if it is one of the malignant tumors, proceed to remove it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh has gone then pour into the nose after cutting some clear water or a drink; but if the nostril opens and moisture flows down to the throat.
So know that it is cured, but if the moisture does not flow as necessary, know that inside there is growing flesh in the upper bones that has not been reached by the cutting instrument, so then you should take a cotton thread with some thickness.
And tie it with many knots and make between each knot a length of a finger or less, and the patient should insert one end of the thread into their nose by force or as much as possible after making it like a needle and pull out his breath until it reaches the turbinate.
The suture will exit from the loop and often behaves like children in a writer's desk, which is an action that makes it easy for whoever wants to do so. Then, both ends of the thread come together, one end coming out of the mouth and the other remaining in the nose.
Then you will use the meat to spread the bond that is in the thread, doing so until you learn that the meat has been cut by the thread bond. Then the thread will come out and become in the nose after wiping away the blood with a gauze that you have soaked in the medicinal solution, doing so for three days or more.
Until the medicinal solution has eaten away all that remains of the meat, then a tube-like thing will remain in the nose for a few days until it heals. If needed, and it has dried out, use it.
And this is an image of the syringe which pours the medicines in the nose:.
He places a bronze or copper like a small candlewick, open-ended and with its channel also.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and shape the syringe's nozzle.
It has a handle at its end as you see, used to hold it when the wax or what you want of liquids or flowing things is placed in it.
The 25th Chapter.
In nasal polyps on the tip of the nose.
Many times a polyp grows in the tip of the nose, increases and multiplies with time until its appearance becomes unpleasant.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it when it first appears and remove the whole of it, then apply a poultice or a cauterizing medication to the site. If cutting fails until it grows large, then look; if it is hard and calcified like a congealed lump with little sensation.
Do not expose it to iron, for it is a cancerous ulcer, and I have often seen cuts made in this ulcer resulting in a great deal of harm to the owner, even if the ulcer is thin-skinned and not inflamed; and I saw that cutting can be done entirely. He should empty the wound and cut it without caution or hesitation, and treat the place with what coagulates and dries until it heals.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
In sewing the nose, lip, and ear. If the connection is severed due to a wound or something similar, know that whenever this happens in one of these facial areas, very little can be done about it except in some people.
When one of those things occurs, look and see if the wound is still bleeding; then gather the edges of the wound together with a suture and treat it until it heals. And if the connection has been severed and each side has become separate, each piece should be peeled away from its visible skin layer until it stops bleeding.
Then gather the two lips together with a suture and tighten it, and apply to it the yolk and gall mixed, and put on top of it a sticking plaster of asphalt or other sticky ointment, and leave it tied for two or three days then release it.
And change the dressing and leave it until the sutures dissolve by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of stitching is to gather the severed connection either with a needle as we described in sewing the abdomen or with thread as I mentioned earlier.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In removing the swellings that appear on the lips.
Many people may have small, hard swellings inside their lips that resemble some of the seeds of the kirsanah and others smaller or larger, so it is necessary to turn the lip and cut around each swelling and tie it with a thread.
The wound is then cut from all sides, then the place after cutting is filled with powdered gypsum until bleeding stops, and then it is sutured with vinegar, salt, and treated accordingly until the wounds heal.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
About Cutting Excess Flesh in the Gums.
Often a surplus of flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called Abolos. It is necessary to tie it with a thread or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its origin and let the blood flow, then put powdered gypsum on the place.
or one of the dried and hardened excrescences; if that flesh returns after treatment, often it returns again; cut it off a second time and leave it alone, for it will not return again.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
About Plating the Teeth with Iron.
Matter may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth from within and without, as well as between the gums, in the form of rough, foul-tasting scales which may spread and become yellowish-green until it reaches the gum and corrupts the teeth because of this.
Then the patient should sit before you with his head in your lap, and you should remove the tartar and tooth that has shown scales to you, down to the very bone, just like you would do with sand, green, yellow, and other colors until it is clean.
And if what is in it does not come out at first, then you should repeat the tartar removal another day and another, until you achieve your goal; and know that the tartar requires a different kind of treatment with many forms and shapes according to what presents itself for your work.
In order that the tartar which is removed from within, is not the same as that which is removed from outside, and that which is removed between the teeth with a different form; and these are many forms of tartar removal, all of which you should have prepared:.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
Extraction of the Teeth.
It is necessary to treat the molar from its pain with all means and not to neglect it, for there is no hope behind if it is extracted; because it is a noble root even if it is not necessary to extract it.
It is necessary if the patient intends to extract it, that you secure until the tooth becomes sound in your hands. For many a time, the patient is deceived by his pain and thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, then the pain does not depart until the sick tooth is extracted; we have seen this repeated in the actions of barbers.
If the tooth becomes sound in your hands, then it is necessary to wrap around the tooth with a cloth that has some strength until the gum is detached from all sides, then move it slightly with your fingers or with fine forceps gradually little by little until it trembles.
Then you will be able to grasp it with the two big forceps, grasping it well, and the patient's head between your knees as if he had been lifted up not moving then pull out the tooth straight so that it does not break; if it does not come out, else take one of those instruments and insert it under him from all sides gently and gradually move him as you did first.
And if the tooth is perforated or has a cavity, it is necessary to fill that hole with a pledget and seal it well with a thin thread so that it does not open up when you pull on it with forceps; and it is necessary to wrap around the gum from all sides tightly.
And conserve your effort so that it does not break and some of it remains in the patient's mouth causing him a greater pain than his initial one; and beware of doing what foolish barbers do in their bridges and operations without using what we have described.
Many people are afflicted with great pains without their teeth being broken and the roots of some of them remaining intact. Or it is possible that some of the jawbones are removed as we have seen repeatedly, then it is rinsed with wine or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, many times this leads to something like a small abscess forming there.
Unless the abscess is effective, take a caliper that moves the tooth first. This caliper should have long arms and a short handle, thick so it does not bend when you grasp it with the tooth. And this is the appearance of large calipers:.
It should be thick-handed so that even when you grasp it firmly, it does not give way or bend. And let it be made of Indian steel or well-wrought iron, with serrations at the end that fit together, allowing a firm and tight grip.
And the arms can be shaped like a muller so it will also be strong in its grasp.
The twenty-first chapter.
In the removal of tooth roots and the extraction of broken jawbones.
If a root remains when the tooth is extracted that has been broken, it should be placed on the site a piece of fat or ghee for one or two days until the site is softened, then enter with a probe or caliper. which resembles the beak of a bird called balrjaa and this is the appearance of the calipers:.
It should be made like a muller from the inside or like an esculent fork. If it is not possible to extract with these calipers, then you should dig into the root and expose all the flesh with a probe, then enter the instrument which resembles a small awl, this is its appearance:.
Shortening the arm is a little bit thick and should not be pierced lest it breaks. If the origin comes out that way, and otherwise seek assistance with these other tools whose shape is this: the first one has a triangular shape in the part containing some thickness:.
Triangular shape, another gentle one:.
And we also assist with this tool having two handles whose shape is this:.
And without others from the tools and appliances mentioned in the chapter on bone-setting, and we also assist with this tool which resembles a large needle whose shape is this:.
Triangular shape of the curved arm, having some thickness a little lest it breaks, and not to be pierced. Know that the tools for bone-setting are many, as well as all other tools, which cannot be counted, and the skillful craftsman may invent for himself tools according to what his work and diseases themselves indicate.
Because some diseases have not been mentioned, and the first tools are not available for their diversity, if a bone in the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or is decayed, then search for it in its place with one of these tools and forceps that were mentioned in the extraction of the origin.
And we also assist with this figure's pattern:.
There is some thickness in it a little to secure the bone so that it does not escape until the bone comes out, and we adjust the position with matching medicines. If the bone has mild decay, remove its decay and smoothness until it is clean, then treat it until it is healed.
The 22nd chapter.
On the spreading of bone-setting on other things.
Bone-setting if it grows on something else, disfigures the shape and especially so if that happens in women and children. It is necessary to look at it closely, for if the bone has grown from behind another bone.
If it is not possible to cut off the piece nor break it, then cut it with this instrument which has this shape:.
And it resembles a small Indian file, and let it be made of very sharp-edged iron; the cutting edge should be set at an angle for many days to harden the tooth so as not to loosen other teeth, but if it is possible to break it, then break it with a cold instrument whose shape this is.
It should be all made of India ink and a thin layer of it should be very fine, like the cold instrument with which needles are made; cool the tooth little by little over many days gently, lest the tooth loosen and fall, then trim it afterwards and remove some of its ridges.
And if the tooth has cracked and some of it is causing the tongue to ache when speaking, then one should also cool it until the sharpness of that crack subsides and becomes even and smooth so that it does not cause the tongue to ache nor spoil the speech.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In binding moving teeth with silver threads or golden threads.
If the anterior teeth loosen and move as a result of a blow or fall, and the patient is unable to chew on anything that is eaten, lest they fall out, and if treatment with binding agents has not been successful.
The trick in this case is to tie with a golden or silver thread, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after some days, while gold remains as it is forever, not subjecting it to that. And the thread should be of medium thickness in the firmness and thinness according to what suits between the teeth.
The shape of the binding is to take the thread and put it into a curve between the two healthy teeth, then sew with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, one or more, until the sewing reaches the other side of the healthy tooth.
Then you will return the suturing to its original side and gently pull your thread with wisdom until it does not move at all, and your suture should be near the roots of the teeth so that it does not come undone. Then cut off the excess thread with scissors and join them together and roll them up in a cloth and hide them between the healthy tooth and the mobile tooth.
So that the tongue is not injured, then leave it like this tied up as much as remains, for if it came undone or its tightness was lost, secure it with another thread and enjoy it thus for all eternity. This is an image of teeth and the state of being joined in two healthy teeth and two movable teeth as you see:.
And if one or two teeth fall and come to their place, they will join together as we described and remain, but only a skilled craftsman can do that. And he may take a piece of cow bone and shape it into the form of a tooth and put it in the place from which the tooth fell. And he will tie it as we said, and it will remain and be enjoyed by that.
The 34th Chapter.
In cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue in preventing speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may either be natural, born with the human being, or it may be secondary to a wound that has healed.
The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth and head in your lap, raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament with a razor until the tongue is released from its hold. If there is some stiffness and complexity and it was due to the healing of a wound, then insert a hook and split it with a razor until the ligament is severed and the knot is untied.
And beware that the incision is not too deep in the flesh, lest it cuts through a vein and exposes bleeding. Then, mouthwash with rosewater or vinegar and cold water after cutting, then place a cotton thread under the tongue which the patient will hold every night.
Unless it is reformed, do not let the bleeding recur; if bleeding occurs, put powdered gypsum on the place. If the blood overpowers you, apply a compress made of a suitable material to the location. Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
The 29th Chapter.
Regarding the removal of the toad that has developed under the tongue.
It may happen that under the tongue a tumor resembling a small toad prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and perhaps even fills the mouth, and in this case one should open the patient's mouth facing the sun and look at the lump.
If you see it is red or black and hard, the patient will not feel its presence; do not meddle with it because it is a tumor. But if it is inclined towards whiteness and there is moisture in it, apply the curette and split it gently with a thin forceps and free it from every direction.
If the blood overpowers you while you are working, put powdered gypsum on it until the bleeding stops then return to your work until you have removed it completely then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment suitable for that, until it heals.
The 38th Chapter.
Regarding the treatment of a tumor of the tonsils.
And whatever grows in the throat from other tumors may develop inside the throat glands resembling those that grow outside and are called tonsils, if treated with what was mentioned in the previous section but did not heal.
And look, if the tumor is hard, red-colored, and insensitive, do not touch it with iron; if it is red-colored and its origin is thick, do not touch it with iron either, fearing bleeding, but rather leave it until it ripens, and then either remove it or let it burst from itself.
If it is white and rounded, and its origin is thin, then this is what should be cut, and the work in it is to look before working if it has settled or reduced some of the abnormality.
Then sit the patient with his face to the sun and his head in your lap, and it will open its mouth and take a servant between your hands and tie his tongue down to the bottom with this instrument:.
You make it from bronze or copper, thin like a scalpel. If you have tied the tongue with this and it becomes clear to you what the tumor is and your sight falls on it, take the forceps and insert them into the abscess and pull them out as much as possible without pulling anything else with them.
Then cut it with this instrument, its shape resembles the pincers except that both ends are bent inwards, very sharply. You make it from Indian steel or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a chisel, its shape being like this:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so after cutting one abscess, cut the other in this same type of cut. Then, after the cut, wash the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If blood discharge appears, wash with water that has the shells of almonds or leaves of asafoetida or something similar in it until the bleeding stops then treat him until he recovers. And if tumors appear elsewhere in the throat besides the abscesses, cut them off in the same manner as the cutting of the abscesses whether they be many.
And I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, hitting the uvula with little sensation, which almost blocked the passage and the woman could not eat or drink water.
The woman was on the verge of death if she had remained for a day or two and the tumor had risen from her nose until it emerged through both nostrils. She then hastened to the physician, who inserted a catheter into one of them, then drew out a healthy piece.
Then she cut it where he reached from the nostril, then did that with what emerged from the other nostril. Then she opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then inserted the catheter into the same tumor and cut off some of it; there was only a slight bleeding.
Then the woman's throat began to move and she hastened from that moment on to drink water, then regained her appetite; we did not cease cutting off a piece of that tumor repeatedly over a long period of time until it became worn out with us and with her.
Then it was removed and the tumor inside the throat became quiet; it ceased to increase, then it subsided from that direction. I do not know what God did with her afterwards.
The 27th Chapter.
On Cutting a Tumor of the Larynx.
That which is called an "unba" if a discharge descends to the larynx and becomes swollen and white, then it is called an "omda", and if it is thick at the bottom and rounded, then it is called an "unba". If treatment was done as mentioned in the division [of cases] and the treatment did not succeed.
And I saw the hot tumor to have subsided from her, and it was thin; it is necessary to cut it. And if it is not congealed and rounded, nor does it have length, and it is dark red or of a certain color or black, or has no sensation; it is necessary to avoid cutting it.
And there is danger to the patient, so it is necessary if you see her with the characteristics I mentioned from its whiteness and length that you make the patient sit in the shade and press his tongue with the instrument which has been described earlier, then insert the catheter into the tumor.
And pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in cutting the almonds, and you should not cut more than what has increased beyond the natural state without excess, for if you cut more, it will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting it, you use what we described in cutting the almonds and treat it until it heals. If the patient refuses to have it cut, then you should use cunning in persuading him without fear or caution, and the way of persuasion is through sharp medicine, which is that you place the patient's head on your lap.
Then, you tie his tongue with the instrument mentioned earlier. Then, take from the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on binding and mix it with a piece of cloth that has not been washed, making it neither thick nor thin, and fill this instrument with it, like this:.
It should be so that the part you put the medicine on is like the scoop of a spoon, and you put the instrument with the medicine on the same place itself, and the patient lies on his side, so that saliva comes out from inside his throat into this instrument, lest something falls into his throat and harms him.
Then, grasp the medicine with your hand and squeeze it onto the place for about half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the medicine's effect has ceased, and if you want to take a thread, wrap it around the corner of the spoon and soak the thread in the medicine.
And put the thread with the spoon into a tube from above until the thread sticks to the place, do that several times until you achieve what you want from binding, then leave it, for it will dry and fall off after three or four days, if you need to repeat the medicine, make it again.
And after binding, wipe around the place with a thread soaked in ghee and absorb what's left of the medicine. Then, rinse with cold water, treat from outside with bandages and from inside with poultices until it heals, for this type of treatment is more secure than cutting and farther from fear.
And also the lhaaah is treated with what is softer than kai and qatta, it is treated with vinegar on this condition. Fodhainj, zu'uba, sa'tir, sudab, shaykh, babung, qiysuum, and similar herbs are taken, then all or some of them are gathered in a pot and immersed in vinegar.
And it is poured into a pot that has been prepared with the wisdom of the earth, and there will be a hole in the middle of the lid, and an instrument made of tin or bronze is placed on it, like this.
And the end that has the calamus is put into the mouth of the patient until the steam rises to the lhaaah on the instrument, until the lhaaah is satisfied then it is repeated several times until it becomes ripe, and beware not to make this treatment at the first appearance of the tumor.
For it often increases in the tumor, but it should be done when the hot tumor subsides. If this instrument is not available, take a pipe and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth does not burn.
Because the shell of the egg prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is one of the good treatments with safety.
The Eighth and Thirty-Ninth Section.
In removing thorns and what sticks in the throat, except for that.
For it often sticks in the throat a bone or a thorn or something else, and one should remove what is visible and comes under sight after compressing the tongue with the instrument at noon.
So that you may know what is in the throat, and what does not appear to you and hides in the throat, and one should purge the patient before he eats his food in his stomach, so perhaps the thing stuck out with the purgative or the patient swallows a piece of cloth or the root of a plant.
He will swallow a piece of dry bread or take a moist strip of seaweed, tie it to a thread, then swallow it. If it reaches the spot where the wound is, he will pull the thread quickly and do that several times.
The wound often sticks to the bone or vertebra and protrudes, if it does not come out as described above. Otherwise, use an instrument made of lead in this shape:.
It will be slightly thicker than a finger and at the end, it is sharpened to fit into the patient's ring with gentleness while he lifts his head upwards and takes care not to touch his windpipe so that coughing does not occur and push out the bone or splinter, or the doctor enters it with his hand.
And the patient enters it better because he knows the location of the emerging thing and pushes or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards as much as is necessary until it comes out.
The 39th Chapter.
In the removal of the foreign object in the throat.
If the object was treated as described in the division of treatments by medicines and it did not succeed, then look at the patient's throat when he is in the sun after his tongue has been pressed with the instrument that I described to you.
If you see the object with your eye, pull it out with a small wire or a thin and firm thread. If you are unable to do so, take a clean tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the object then insert a heated iron into the hollow of the tube.
He will do that several times and the patient will abstain from water all day, then he will take a cup filled with cold water, open his mouth in it and gargle with it without swallowing any of it and move the water with his hand after a while.
If the leech drops off at the place where it has felt water, then if it does not come out as we have described, it is washed away by urine and by a solution of salt in the instrument which we have mentioned in the book of the Creator; it should be done several times because it will drop off.
The purpose of the instrument in the cauterizer is to take a quantity of hot red wax with fire, and the quantity should be covered by a cloth, except for a hole in the middle. Then, the instrument should be inserted into that hole, and the cauterizer should place his finger into the opening of the tube and close it so that the cauterizer does not know when the cauterizer has reached the throat.
If the leech drops off at the place, then if it does not drop off, the cauterizer should repeat this process and the patient should endure thirst and eat salt and garlic, but should not drink water, for there is no way out except by this method. This is an image of the instrument that attracts the leech from the throat when it has been looked at.
And it resembles the tweezers as you see, except that it has this groove which enters the throat and its two sides resemble the beak of a bird where roughness is applied if something does not leave.
And another instrument is used to hold the tongue, which is a wide ring of iron that can accommodate the mouth above the tongue. It enters the mouth standing upright on its side and keeps the mouth open without the patient's will, so they cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this manner exactly.
The Forty-Fourth Section.
He will make a cut in the speech of the boil and split it.
The boils are of many kinds, distinguished according to what is mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their contents and nature from two aspects: the type of boil itself and what it contains of moisture.
The second type of tumors that occur in the body because the tumor occurring in the head is not like the tumor occurring in the pelvis, nor is the tumor occurring in a fatty area not like the tumor occurring in a joint for each one of them there is a rule of action.
And among the tumors, there is one that should not be excised until the pus has matured and been fully formed, and there is one that should be excised while it is still fresh and has not yet fully matured, such as those that are close to joints.
Because if the tumor occurs near a joint and persists until it corrupts what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint will be damaged, becoming the cause of lameness in that limb or making the tumor occur near a main organ.
Because if you delay excision until it has fully matured, you will harm the main organ or make it occur near the pelvis, so you should excise the tumor while still fresh and not yet fully mature, except for the one that occurs near the pelvis, lest the pus spread and perforate into the inside of the pelvis to become an abscess.
And it will become chronic and incurable, and you should learn when to excise tumors that have fully matured, which is at the moment of calm, pain relief, fever abatement, pallor, pulse weakening, and signs of tumor regression.
And you should aim to excise the tumor at its lowest point if possible, so that the bleeding will be towards the bottom or in a more superficial part of the tumor and less severe, and the excision should be in the direction of the length of the body if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And in the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and vessels, and in general in all flat areas without curvature, whereas if it is curved then excise according to that location, and as for tumors occurring in fatty areas, it is best to leave them alone.
Until his vitality becomes stable as we said at the end, you should not cut off excess flesh from him beforehand, for it may cause excessive sweating and many wounds and perhaps harden his lips and nostrils, and some ulcers may break out on the surface of the body in necessity or according to what the affected part needs.
It is necessary to use a small incision in small ulcers and a wide incision or multiple cuts as needed according to the size of the ulcer, and there may be ulcers that require the skin to be slit open and cut if it has become like a shred.
And it was in some cases that the patient died like what is seen in many cases of debility and wasting away, from which some cut a gash with three corners and others cut out something resembling the shape of a palm tree or an Arabian leaf.
And there are those that use a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and so on. As for what does not have a head like smooth flat ulcers, it is necessary to make only a small incision. And if the ulcer is large and has accumulated pus over a long period and been lanced, one should not proceed until all the pus comes out at that time.
But some of it is extracted first, then the ulcer is left until another day and some pus is extracted also, to do that repeatedly by degrees until all of it comes out.
And especially if the patient is weak in strength or a pregnant woman or a young child or an elderly man, the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden extraction of pus, so that the patient may die and you may not feel it, beware of this matter extremely.
And after lancing these ulcers, it is necessary to clean the wound and examine it. If the ulcer's wound is small or the incision is a single simple one, use the lint of flax or cotton wool. And if the ulcer is large and there are many cuts from lancing,
It is necessary to insert a thread into each seam until some of it reaches the other, and if the tumor has been cut from the skin or scraped off, it should be covered with cotton wool or linen rag without moisture and fastened for three days.
Then remove it and treat it as needed with ointments until it clears, if bleeding occurs during your work use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and apply it to the bleeding spot several times.
If the bleeding persists, it is necessary to use the remedies and treatments that we have described in many places of this book and in the classification, if you are in the winter season and the location of the tumor is richly supplied with nerves, then anoint the remedies with wine and hot oil.
And apply it to the spot, and if you are in the summer season and the location is hot-blooded, then soak the remedies with water and oil or with wine and oil, all of which should be cold; until the third day as we said, then the tumor will resolve and soften.
And use what is similar to it in its treatment until it clears, this is all you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general; as for the method of detail, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it briefly.
The 44th Section.
On the tumors that appear on the skin of the head.
Tumors appear on the skin of the head, small ones that are types of pustules contained within scales resembling chicken pox, and their varieties are many; some are fatty, and some contain moisture similar to pus.
And some contain moisture similar to pus, and some are hard and calcified; all of them have no danger in their incision and removal, unless a blood vessel is encountered when making the incision.
The operation in this case is to incise it first with the instrument which comes after this and is called the madis, until you learn what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it with a simple incision along this shape:.
Start with an incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~, and if the moisture has been released, cut away the sac that contained that moisture and cut it completely off without leaving any of it at all. For often it recedes if anything remains.
Then soak a thread in the powdered resin, if available; otherwise, in saltwater. Fill the wound with it and leave it for another day, as what remains of the sac will be consumed. Then apply the thread again with the powdered resin twice or thrice if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the swelling contains fatty matter, incise it along this shape:.
Incise it smoothly and insert the absorbent pads into the edges of the wound, and remove it from all sides. Exhaust your effort in extracting the membrane that contains them, unless a vein intervenes, then do what I described to you afterwards. And similarly, do the same in the swelling if it has become detached from the incision.
And the treatment is as I mentioned, and the incision on the detached swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. And some of these swellings that are in the head of some people may not have any moisture with them, which is why I incised a swelling in.
The head of an old woman, and I found the swelling to be as hard as solid stone, white and dense, which no one could break even if they tried to throw it. And what happened with other swellings that occurred in the head was not like this, except for those that appeared on the heads of children.
When dealing with the ears, cut all of them into simple incisions and make the opening from the eardrum so that it is easy to pour in the medication downwards, then treat it according to its condition.
The Forty-Second Chapter.
In the incision on the necks of those that are often exposed to these tumors in the neck and under the armpits and in the groin, and which may appear in every part of the body, some of them being single and others multiple, and some arising from one another.
And each of these hogs will be in a special sac belonging to it, just as in the veins and tumors of the head as we have described, and the types of these hogs are many, some being hardened, others secreting fluids, and others malignant and not responding to treatment.
As for what I saw from it, the condition was good when touched and its appearance was near the color of the skin, moving in all directions without being attached to the neck's nerve or ligament or artery nor was it curved. It is necessary to cut it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this shape from line ~j~ to line ~b~.
And remove it from all sides and stretch the skin flaps with a clamp or two clamps or many clamps if needed as we said in the case of head tumors, and bring it out little by little and be on the neck without cutting any nerve or artery, and let the surgeon not be very sharp.
So that your hand does not increase in cutting or disturb the patient, and you do not cut what is not needed to be cut; if you cut a nerve or artery and prevent yourself from working, put powder-like alum or some of the hemostatic substances that stop bleeding into the wound.
And close the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound heals, and you pay attention to the pus; for when it stops bleeding then return to your work until you are done, then search with your index finger if there is any remaining, and then cut off and clean another hog.
If there is a large vein in the origin of the swine, it should not be cut from its origin, but rather it should be bound with a double and tight thread and left until it falls out by itself without harm, then the wound should be filled with cotton soaked in the Egyptian ointment and treated.
And if you cut the entire swine, it is necessary to gather up the edges of the wound and sew it from its seam after you have made sure that there is no excess whatsoever. If you see that there still remains some excess due to the size of the swine.
It is necessary to aim for its origin and foundation and use stitching as we have mentioned, and what is contained in the swine with fluids should be bound with a thin layer where you see its place of ripeness and make the bandage below as we said.
Then use after the bandage the poultice with Egyptian ointment and similar substances to consume what remains of the corruption until you see that the wound has been thoroughly cleaned by the medicated plastering, until it is healthy.
The Third Forty-Fourth Section.
In a cut of the throat from a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients have mentioned this cut in the throat and I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the order of their speech. However, those who suffer from constriction should avoid cutting the throat as it will not benefit them.
In order that all the organs and lung may be at ease, and as for those who have a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or tonsils if there is no cause in the trachea, it is necessary to use the cut in the throat for the relief from the obstruction which arises from constriction.
It is necessary if we wish to do so that we cut the throat under three circles of the trachea or four small cuts in width between two circles as much as the cut is in the peritoneum not in the cartilage and this position agrees with the cut.
Because it is lean of flesh and the blood vessels from it are far away, then if the healer is cautious he should stretch the skin of the throat with a suture, then cut the skin until he comes to the jugular vein, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees anything.
Then he should incise the peritoneum which we have described, and ascertain the incision of the jugular vein from the phlegm that comes out with what is torn off and loss of voice; and leave the wound open for a time until the fear of suffocation has passed. If the time has gone by when he was afraid, he should bring together the lips of the wound from the skin.
And he should draw it alone without a splint, then use the medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals. He who composed this book has said: The explanation of all this talk which we have mentioned is only if they see the patient's windpipe closed by one of these tumors which were mentioned.
And the patient was on the verge of death, and he himself thought to stop breathing. They went up to the incision of the larynx so that the patient could breathe at the site of the wound some breaths and escape from death. But they were ordered to leave the wound open until the disease subsides and its course is three days or so.
So they were ordered to stitch the wound and treat it until it heals, and what I saw with my own eyes was that a servant took a needle and sent it to her throat alone, cut off some part of the pulmonary artery; and I was called to treat her, but found her as if slaughtered, so I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be slight, so I was certain that she had not cut a main artery or a vital one; and the breath was coming out of the wound. So I began by cutting open the wound and treating it until it healed, and nothing was found wrong with the servant except for a slight impairment in her voice, no more.
The wound returned to its best condition after some days, so we say that the incision of the larynx is not dangerous.
The 44th chapter.
In the incision on the tumor that appears in the bronchus from outside and is called the tracheal swelling.
This tumor which is called the tracheal swelling is a great tumor on the color of the body and it is common in women, and it has two kinds.
Either it is natural or incidental, so either the natural one has no cure and either the incidental one will be of two kinds: one similar to fatty growths and the other similar to the tumor that arises from the complications of an artery and in its incision there is danger. It is not right to expose it (the tumor) to iron at all, except what is small of it and is explored and searched with a probe until it resembles fatty growths and is not related to anything from the arteries, so cut it as one cuts on fatty growths. And remove it with what it contains from the sac if it is in a sac, otherwise search for all of them then treat the place as needed.
The 45th chapter.
In the incision on types of fatty growths.
Fatty growths are many in kind and I mentioned all their kinds in the division, and it is necessary to inform here about the difference between fatty growths and abscesses as they are confusing, so I say that an abscess has with it heat and fever and frightening pains until the pus subsides. And the abscess continues to grow, and then the fever subsides and the pain ceases, whereas fatty growths are not accompanied by heat or fever or pains, and it is contained in a sac-like casing which has a special cavity for it and it is on the color of the body and it begins like a boil and becomes like a tumor, larger or smaller.
This wound is of two kinds, either fatty or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are numerous as mentioned in the classification, therefore if you reach the wound to be treated, first examine and inspect it with the instrument called "al-mads" as its picture appears in the next chapter.
The size of the tumor is then measured, then take out the mads and look at what comes out in its wake. If watery liquid comes out, no matter what color it was, cut it with a slight incision as mentioned in all tumors. And if no liquid comes out after taking out the mads, know that it is fatty.
Cut into it with a well-shaped incision as I have informed you, and attach it to the sutures. Remove the skin from all sides gently and preserve it in a pouch if possible so that you can bring out the tumor correctly with it.
And if the pouch tears while working and you are unable to bring it out correctly, that often happens. Bring it out in pieces until nothing is left. For if anything remains, either little or much, the tumor will return to its original condition.
And if it is difficult and only a small amount remains, then clean the wound with some sharp and effective ointments and compresses. Apply what calms the tumor and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the tumor is large, mark its edges and treat it with what brings relief.
And if a vein or an artery obstructs you, or bleeding occurs, immediately apply the powdered powder to the spot and leave it closed for two or three days until the wound heals and the bleeding subsides. Then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.
The Forty-Eighth Chapter.
In Pictures of Instruments.
The forms of swelling that occur in the incision and its surrounding area are three types, one large, one middle-sized, and one small.
Form of great swelling:.
Form of middle-sized swelling:.
Form of small swelling:.
It is made of steel, four-sided and tight, to facilitate entry into tumors; this is the form of the probe and it is called the cold one; there are three types, large, middle-sized, and small. Large probe:.
Middle-sized probe:.
Small probe:.
It is suitable for searching with the tumors, and surgeons, and bone-setters, and midwives to know what is inside them from bones and other things. It is made curved, polished, smooth like the scales of a Chinese crocodile or a snake, or from copper or iron or silver; and the best one was made from espadrille.
And probes can also be made from black lead, and it is suitable for bone-setters who have a curvature in their thigh to bend with that curvature; it also has three types, one long, one middle-sized, and one short.
According to the need of each bone-setter, it makes its thickness in accordance with the width and narrowness of the bone-setter; form of a large lead probe:.
Form of middle-sized lead probe:.
Form of small lead probe:.
Forms of forceps, and they are many types because there is a simple one with one claw and it has three types, large, middle-sized, and small; from among them, the forceps of the blind ones have three types; from among them, the forceps with two claws have three types; and from among them, the forceps with teeth-like claws. And they are three types, from among them the forceps with three claws and it has three types; all of these types each one needs in its place. Form of a simple large forcep:. Simple illustration of a straight needle. Small simple illustration of a needle.
Large illustration of a blind needle. Simple illustration of a blind needle.
Small illustration of a blind needle.
Large illustration with needle guards. Simple illustration with needle guards. Small illustration with needle guards.
Large illustration with three needle guards.
Simple illustration with three needle guards. Small illustration with three needle guards.
And these are the illustrations of the trephines which cut and scrape away at tumors and growths, and there are three kinds, great ones, moderate ones, and small ones. Large illustration of a trephine.
Moderate illustration of a trephine.
Small illustration of a trephine.
Its edges which it cuts are limited and the other extremities are not limited, but I made it thus so that one can use it in scraping away at a growth when afraid of cutting a nerve or artery and thereby causing the patient some relief from the pain they experience when scraping away at the tumor.
And these are the illustrations of the probes, and they are three kinds, great ones, moderate ones, and small ones. Large illustration of a probe.
It is made of bronze similar to a half-moon shape that can be curved and on one side it resembles a broad spoon with two layers, at its head there is a concealed cutting edge resembling the tongue of a bird that goes in and out as desired.
Illustrations of the forceps that are placed between the fingers when dissecting tumors, so that the patient does not feel it, and there are three kinds, great ones, moderate ones, and small ones. Large illustration of a forceps.
Pictures of the ligatures with which bleeding is stopped and they are three kinds because some are large, some middle-sized, and some small, Picture of the large ligature:.
It is made of copper or a steel ball that is slightly rounded to the length as you see it and it comes with a handle, it is necessary for you to have these kinds of ligatures both large and small in order to stop bleeding quickly when needed and when medication is not available.
But you should not use it to cut the blood in every place of the body and rather use it in soft places like thigh muscles, leg muscles, arm muscles, breast, abdomen, and similar moist organs.
And it can also be made into small instruments that resemble pistachio shells as seen on this image:.
It is used to stop the bleeding if it flows from a puncture wound or when cutting a vein, and it can also be made into a rounded instrument as seen on this image:.
The 47th section.
For treating a woman's breast boil.
That resembles a woman's breast, and the breast of some people may become swollen to resemble a woman's breast until it remains ugly, so whoever dislikes that should cut into the breast with a crescent-shaped incision as seen on this shape.
From line B to line C:. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with medicinal ointment, and then close the edges of the wound by stitching and treat it until it heals, if the breast sinks low and relaxes as women usually expose themselves.
It is necessary to incise in its upper sides with two incisions resembling a helical shape, each one connected to the other at their ends until the larger line becomes encompassed by the smaller one like this. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then remove the skin between the incisions, and extract the fat. Use what we mentioned earlier about suturing and instruments, and whatever is needed for treatment until it heals.
If you are unable to take out what needs to be taken out due to the patient's anxiety or bleeding, then fill the wound with a mixture of lint soaked in astringent ointment and leave it until the remaining fat is absorbed, then treat it until it heals.
The Forty-Eighth Chapter.
In the armpit of tumors which are exposed under the arm.
These tumors that are exposed under the arm are a type of hardened abscesses surrounded by a sac, and some of them contain fluids; as for those that contain fluids, it is necessary to make an incision in a helical shape like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~, if you have drained out all the contents of the tumor, then pack it with wool and leave it until another day, then remove the wool.
And treat it with an ointment that matches it until it heals, if the tumor is of the type of hardened abscesses, then incise it as we mentioned earlier for the abscesses, regardless; and if the wound continues to bleed so that pus forms, use the caustic in the manner mentioned earlier.
The Forty-Ninth Chapter.
In the incision of the tumor that is exposed before the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it is torn, then often a tumor will appear from that and also a swelling in the vein.
The signs by which one knows that the swelling and inflation are from an artery or a vein. The swelling if it is from the artery will be cylindrical and gathered in depth in the body, and if you push on the swelling with your finger, you feel it as if it had flesh.
What is from the vein will be swelling rounded in the external body. The incision on these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpits, thighs, and neck, and in many places of the body, and it is extremely great, so one should avoid treating them with iron.
And also those in the extremities or in the head, one should avoid. As for that which is from the swelling of an artery, make a cut on it on the skin, a long incision, then open the incision with scissors, and then excise the artery and free it from the surrounding tissues.
Until it is fully exposed, then insert a needle and push it to the other side and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I have informed you about the two arteries in the armpits, then cut off the place between the ligaments until all the blood that is in it comes out.
And the swelling will recede, then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off, then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a vein incision, it is necessary to hold with your hand as much of the swelling as you can grasp along with the skin, then insert a needle below the place where you grasped with your hand and push it through with a double thread until you bring it out on the other side. Then bind the swelling with a good knot according to what I mentioned to you about binding the node from both sides with the thread, if you fear that the threads will come loose, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole swelling where the first needles intersect.
Tie the threads in four places, then cut the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out. Cut off the excess skin and leave what was from it attached, then put on a dressing that has been soaked in wine and oil. Then use the treatment made with turpentine and ointment until it heals.
The 50th chapter.
On the tumor that occurs from nerve compression.
Just as the tumor occurs in an artery and a vein, so too does it occur in a nerve if there is a blow or excessive fatigue or something similar, and this is more common in places such as the elbows and hips.
And in each joint, it moves like a tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body and is usually without pain; if it is pressed with force, the patient will feel numbness, but the tumor is not consolidated in the depth of the body.
But it is under the skin and moves in all directions, not going forward or backward; as for what occurs in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, lest it cause damage; as for what occurs on the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a lancet; if the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base; if it is large, tie it off with thread and remove it, then gather the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
The 51st chapter.
On cutting of ulcers that occur in the abdomen.
Many people may have some in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, which are called ulcers because they resemble the fungus, its base is thin and its head is thick. Its edges can become ulcerated and there can be small ones and large ones that are very significant.
I have seen a man with two growths in his abdomen, resembling the roots of plants, with no white part whatsoever. They had transformed into two lips and were constantly oozing moisture. I cut them off and threw them away weighing about eighteen ounces or six ounces in the other one.
And the action in cutting them is to look at them. If the patient is wet and the color of the growth is white, soft and moist, then cut it off with a broad knife and have your assistant hold the cauterizing iron in the fire, as it often happens that much blood flows when they are cut.
Then, if the bleeding is severe, cauterize it. If you see that the patient is becoming anxious and frightened from the cutting with iron, take a strong lead thread and bind it around the growth, leaving it for two days, then increase the tension on the lead, but do not stop tightening it.
Whenever you intervene with the growth until it detaches and falls off on its own without any difficulty, if the growth is thick in origin, there is some fear and danger when cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut half or part of it.
Then, cauterize it so that it does not recur. Then, treat it until the wound heals. And beware of cutting a growth that is cancerous, with little sensation and unpleasant appearance, for it is a type of sarcoma. We will mention sarcoma after this.
The Second Chapter Fifty.
In the treatment of breast tumors.
A breast tumor can be caused by many reasons, either from the rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, which emerges as a growth or a mass, as it appears in all the regions, or from blood that arises from a vein or artery, as mentioned earlier, or from wind being trapped in it.
If it is before the rupture of the intestine and the protrusion of the tumor, then the color of the tumor will be similar to the color of the body and it will be soft without pain and will appear in a different position. And if it is before the excretion of feces, then its position will be with what we described a greater difference. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, and sometimes there may be a lump and becomes much larger when entering the bath and experiencing great fatigue; if it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then this tumor appears black; if it is due to fat that has grown in, then the tumor is hard and steady like one piece.
If it is due to wind, then its touch is soft, and the treatment in that case is to look. If the pulse comes from before the artery or vein or wind, then one must refrain from treating it because there is fear and anxiety as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned the tumors that occur before the artery and vein.
If the pulse comes from before the intestine or tumor, then one must order the patient to hold himself and stand upright and stretched, then learn with a poultice around the whole tumor. Then order him to lie down before you on his back, then take a wide bandage around the tumor on the place where you learned with the poultice, then stretch it across the middle of the tumor up high with a large needle, then bind the binding place with a strong silk thread binding tightly.
And the binding knot will be tightened, then open the stretched tumor above the bandage and put your index finger inside and ask for the intestine; if you find it, take it with the bandage and push the intestine into the abdominal cavity, and if you find a tumor, then straighten it with a needle.
Cut off its superiority, if a vessel or artery obstructs you. Then, bind it tightly and return to your work. Take two syringes and insert into them two strong threads. Insert the syringes into the tourniquet that you made around the swelling, making it four points.
And if you wish, remove the syringes and leave the site until the congealed flesh becomes putrid and falls off by itself or is cut off if it rots and putsrefies. Then, treat it with whatever ointments are necessary until it heals. If the abscess has formed in fatty tissue.
Or if it's due to moisture, then you should excise the swelling as we said and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it. Then, treat the site with what's necessary.
The 53rd Chapter.
In the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, and warned against treating it with iron lest it spread. We also mentioned uterine cancer and warned against treating it.
And the ancients have said that when cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer of the breast or thigh and similar organs, then it should be excised entirely, especially if it's initial and small. But if it has progressed and become large, it shouldn't be touched.
For I was not able to cure anyone from it, and I have not seen anyone else who has reached that point. And if the case is in a place where I said one should proceed, then the patient will recover with ease after several episodes, and if it's in the veins, it will be evident.
Then the patient will recover with ease, and is able to do the work. Then one should place the patient in a position where the cancer can be reached, and then cauterize it with suitable instruments. One should excise it completely from all sides, even to the skin, carefully following its roots, and let the blood flow freely without cutting it quickly.
Dry the area and stop all thick blood with your hand or what instruments you can manage, if you encounter a problem in your work, and great bleeding occurs from cutting a vein or artery, stop the bleeding until it ceases then treat it as usual until it heals.
The 50th Chapter.
In treating the abscess.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of dropsy and how the water comes together with the signs of each type, and its treatment by medications, and that which is treated by iron is only the type of yellow dropsy and does not approach the type of red or fleshy dropsy at all.
If that is a battle, then look closely if you have treated this type of yellow abscess with medications and your treatment has not been effective, because perhaps the patient has weakened in it or has another disease besides the abscess such as.
Cough or diarrhea and the like, so refrain from treating him with iron, for it is a trap. If you see that the patient has great strength and does not have any disease besides the abscess alone, and he is not a child nor an old man, then direct your action to standing the patient before you upright. And a servant stands behind him, squeezing his abdomen with his hands and pushing the water downwards towards the anus, then take a sharp spoon in this shape.
Limited in its two sides, long and limited at the end like a spoon except that there is some fat little bit lest it gets in the way when working on the anus and causes him harm then look carefully if the abscess originates from the direction of the intestines.
It is necessary to cut from the scar as much as three fingers' width downwards, following its course above the anus. If the abscess originates from liver disease, then your incision should be on the left side of the scar by three fingers. If it originates from spleen disease, then make the incision on the right side of the scar by three fingers.
And it is not proper that the incision be in the side where the patient wishes to lie on, lest the fluids flow to that weak spot. Then use the instrument to cut through all the skin and enter the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
With the probe between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you were peeling it away, and make the quantity peeled off like the length of a toenail or more. Then perforate the peritoneum until the probe reaches an empty space which is the location of the water, then withdraw it and insert the other instrument into that hole.
And it is like a tube made from thin reed, fabricated from tin or copper or smooth wood, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other as you see.
And it may be put in with a rounded tip resembling a reed pen like this.
And at the top of it there is a ring, so that when the instrument reaches the water, then it goes down on the instrument, and takes out from the water in the meantime an average amount, for if you take out more than what is proper in the meantime then perhaps the patient will die due to dissipation of his vital spirits.
Or he may become pale and approach death, but take out from it according to his strength and what guides you about the patient's condition from his pulse and good color, then withdraw the instrument and stop the water, that is, make him hold his breath.
Because of the skin that is holding the incision which I told you to seal on that side, then redo the instrument the next day if you see the patient fit for it.
And take out also a small amount of water, do that days and you are on guard, watching not to make an error, until there is only a small amount of water left, for if you weaken the patient and leave a large amount of water, he will be affected by being buried in hot sand.
The treatment of the patient with excessive bleeding in the bath and sun, and applying it to thirst, and treating it with dried medicines until he recovers, and purging him after extracting water as I described earlier.
The 50th chapter.
In the treatment of children who are born with urethral openings that are not normally situated or whose opening is narrow or in an abnormal location.
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an unopened urethra, therefore it is necessary to open it as soon as they are born.
With a very fine needle:.
Then you put a thin copper pin into the opening and tie it, holding onto it for three or four days until the patient wants to urinate and then remove it; if you don't do this, the urine that flows onto the area may not leave it closed.
As for those whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead as we said, for many days until it widens; and among them are those who are born with the opening in an abnormal place, such that some of them are born with the opening at the end of the penis and cannot urinate forward.
until he raises the penis with his hand above and it does not have a chance to urinate before the sperm cannot reach the womb on account, which is a very bad condition; and the solution for that is that the patient lies on his back.
Then you stretch the penis with your left hand very tightly and straighten the head of the penis with a sharp razor or a fine pen nib, as if you were cutting something to be in the middle like a sheath, so that the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And take care to prevent bleeding while you are doing the procedure, as it often occurs; counteract it by applying something that stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
The Sixth and Fifty Chapter.
In the pustule that appears on the scrotum, in the groin, in the blackness and corruption and adhesion of the scrotum to the groin.
This pustule often appears in the urethra, and it is a hard abscess that may be foul or not foul. The one that is not foul should be tied with a gentle ligature.
And cut it until it is all clean, then apply a medicated thread in the Egyptian ointment and treat it with that afterwards until it heals. And if the pustule is foul and has a foul color, one should use vinegar after cutting and cleaning it.
If the pustule is in an uncircumcised scrotum and some of it is inside and some outside, one should remove the part that is inside first, until it has healed, then treat the rest from outside.
Because if you treat them together, the scrotum may perforate. It also often appears in women and in the scrotum as blackness and corruption, so one should remove all that has become black or is about to corrupt or has corrupted.
Then apply honey on it afterwards, along with the crushed and pounded almonds and crimson then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use vinegar in a halo shape like this:.
If the vinegar is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and wound if it becomes corrupted, then if the groin area becomes inflamed and has gone all the way up at some time, one should enter a lead tube into the urethra to wash away what is upon it. And as for adhesion of the scrotum to the groin.
And this adhesion happens to him whose scrotum is healthy and has not been circumcised, and it may occur as a result of a wound or tumor. It should be removed with a wet cloth until the bond is loosened and the groin area is freed from all sides.
If difficulty arises in distinguishing between the pericardium and the pleura, it is necessary to strip away something from both. The pleura is thin, so it may tear quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the pleura from the pericardium with a very thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so as not to stick also.
Then he treats it with a constrictive medicine until it heals.
The Fifty-Seventh Chapter.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of what befalls them from error.
Circumcision is not anything other than the separation of connection, just like all other surgeons, except that since it is one of our actions done by our will and used particularly in boys, we must define the best practice for it.
And the easier way leading to safety, I say that the early ones did not mention circumcision in anything from their books because it was not used in their laws and we acquired it.
Through experience, and that I found the majority of craftsmen and barber-surgeons using purification with soap and water, and using forceps and bandages with thread and cutting with the scalpel, and I have tried all these methods.
So I did not find anything better than purification with the scalpel and bandages with thread, because purification with soap often leaves the skin rough, since the pleura is layered, so maybe the upper layer of the skin was cut off and the lower layer remained.
And it is necessary to cut again and the pain starts anew, and purification with forceps does not ensure that the end of the foreskin will not be cut because it may enter into its hole, and as for purification with the scalpel, maybe the skin will split open and your work will be ruined or the boy's skin was naturally short..
Many are born that way and do not need purification, and I have seen that. And as for purification with the scalpel and bandages with thread, experience has revealed its excellence because the scalpel is suitable for cutting in a way that the incision above is like the incision below.
When you cut your incision according to the matching of the two knife blades in one measurement and at one time, and the knot of the thread is almost a wall against the skin of the urethra from all directions, so that not even a single error occurs with it. The face of the operation is first that you should imagine the boy.
And especially if he is one who barely understands that you are only binding the thread in his urethra and leaving it for another day, then delighting him with all possible speed, and accepting it from his intellect. Then, stop between your hands standing upright.
And do not have him sitting and place the forceps in your hand or under his foot, so that not even an eye of the boy falls on it or anything from the instruments. Then, insert your hand into his urethra and blow on the skin and peel it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then, remove what is present inside it from hair and ties the informed spot with a double thread. Then, tie slightly below it as a second tie, then grasp with your thumb and pinky finger the lower tie tightly and cut between the two ties. Then, lift the skin up quickly and pull out the head of the urethra. Then, let a little blood flow as it is better and less for the inflammation of the urethra. Then, wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle dry burned pumpkin ashes on him, for this is the best I have tried or the most refined among the surgeons, and it is also excellent.
Then, lift the skin up quickly and pull out the head of the urethra. Then, let a little blood flow as it is better and less for the inflammation of the urethra. Then, wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle dry burned pumpkin ashes on him, for this is the best I have tried or the most refined among the surgeons, and it is also excellent. Then, take it to the swelling from above in a cloth wrapped with a cooked egg white soaked in rose water and mixed with fragrant red ointment. Leave it on him until another day, then treat him with other medication until he recovers.
And this is the picture of the forceps which is suitable for cleansing:.
The wounds will be very deep, not twisted, and the splints will not be perforated. The length of the two splints should be equal to the length of the handles, regardless. However, if an error occurs in cleansing, it is possible that the inner skin layer may all or partly turn over when cutting, so it is necessary to replace it with your finger before the wound becomes swollen.
And cut it even. If you are unable to hold it with your finger, pull it out with a forceps and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the skin remains swollen and warm, leave it until the swelling subsides and then remove it gently.
And cut it according to what appears to you, and be cautious from the head of the urethra. If you cut something from the head of the urethra, it will not harm; treat the wound with what we described in the chapter on complications.
And if you cut too much skin and it shrinks above, that will not cause much harm; treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
The 48th Chapter.
In the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder is caused by its obstruction from a stone or hard blood clot or mucus or flesh growth, and so if you treat that with what we mentioned, types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow and you see that its retention is due to a stone which has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should sit on his heels, then one foot will be placed on his back, and he will stretch out his belly to his back, and hold himself as much as possible.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone back and the urine will flow. If it does not flow as mentioned, and the situation becomes more severe for the patient, then you should use the instrument called catheter, which is described as follows:.
Here is the translation:
The thread enters the bottom of the catheter and is tightened with a ligature if something from the wool is preferred so that it enters the tube and closes it like a stopper, then the catheter is greased with oil or fat or white egg and the patient sits on a stool.
The bladder and urethra are washed with wet soap or oil and lukewarm water, then the catheter enters the urethra gently until it reaches the root of the urethra, then the urethra bends upwards towards the navel and the catheter is pushed inside.
Until the urethra bends and the catheter is pushed inside until it reaches close to the scrotum, the penis inclines downwards and the catheter is inside then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that something is empty.
And this is done in this order because the channel that urine flows through it curves, then the thread is pulled with wool tightly so that the urine follows the wool, then it is taken out and the catheter is reused.
And it continues to be done until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
The 50th section.
How to Catheterize the Bladder with a Siphon.
The instruments that are suitable for this purpose are made from ivory or finely smoothed bone, having a long tube on one side and a receptacle to hold water and medicine, called a siphon, and this is its shape:.
It is made from ivory or finely smoothed bone, having a long tube on one side and a receptacle smooth all over except for the end, which has three holes, two on one side and one on the other as you see.
The hollow place where the projectiles are placed is as wide as it needs to be without excess, until something from the moisture is attracted and if something is pushed away, it moves backwards according to what is done with the oil that is thrown in naval battles.
If you want to remove the moisture from the bladder, put one end of the reed-like instrument into the moisture and pull it up with the projectile. Then the moisture will be attracted into the hollow of the reed-like instrument, and its tip will enter the urethra as we described earlier in the catheterizers, and then push out the moisture with the projectile.
For that moisture to reach the bladder, as we described earlier, until the patient feels it, and this is also a picture of a gentle catheter that is used to drain the bladder:.
It is made from fir or asparagus, its upper part resembling a small pipe and below it is a bag that contains the ligament, then one takes a sheep's bladder and puts in the moisture you want to drain from the bladder, and then ties them together tightly with a thread of twisted leather.
And the moisture is heated slightly on the fire, then one puts the tip of the catheter into the urethra, and then tightens your hand on the bladder with the moisture tightly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of linen, make a circle out of it and pierce it all around its circumference, then insert a tight thread into that piercing as it turns, and then gather the circle as you gather a saddle after putting in what you want from moisture, liquids, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you used with a bladder, from the time your hand is on it until the moisture reaches the bladder.
The 30th chapter.
On removing stones.
We have mentioned in the classification types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and we have noted the difference between those produced in the kidney and those produced in the bladder, as well as their signs; and we have also mentioned the type of stone that requires surgical intervention by hand or incision.
And these are the stones produced in the bladder, specifically those that attach themselves to the urethra; I will describe this in detail and with brevity.
I say that the stones produced in the bladder are more prone to be affected by children, and one of its signs is that the urine exits the bladder like water in thinness.
And gravel appears in it, and its presence is felt and it causes trouble; often it subsides then spreads and appears with the urine in many of them, and it is easily expelled from children until they reach fourteen years old, but it becomes more difficult in the elderly; as for young men, it is intermediate between that.
And the one who has larger stones will have an easier treatment, while the smaller ones are contrary to that; if we proceed with the treatment, it is necessary first to inject the patient with a catheter that removes all sediment from his bladder, for it may prevent the existence of the stones when examined.
Then the patient is taken by his legs and pulled, shaken down to the bottom so that the stones go down to the neck of the bladder or are pushed from a high place several times; then he is seated before you standing up with his hands under his thighs so that the entire bladder inclines downwards and is searched.
And search for it from outside; if you feel the stone in the space, begin to incise it at that moment; if it does not fall under, it is necessary to wipe the thumb of the left hand with oil if the patient is a child or the middle finger.
If the child is still in his pubescence, then enter it into its seat and search for the stones until they fall under your finger. Then, move them slightly, slightly to the neck of the bladder, and then compress them with your finger and push them outwards towards the place you want to cut.
And command a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to stretch out his right hand towards above and his other hand to stretch the skin underneath towards the position where the incision will be. Then take the curved scissors which have this shape:.
And cut between the pubescence and the perineum, not in the middle but beside the left ilium. The incision will be on the same stone and your finger in the pubescence and you press it outwards, forcing the stones to come out, making the incision wide from outside and narrow from inside as much as possible for the stones to exit.
Not too big, for perhaps you pressed the stone with your finger in the pubescence at the incision and it comes out easily. And know that there may be stones that have corners and edges making their exit difficult therefore.
And from it smooth ones that resemble pomegranates and are curved, making their exit easy. As for those that have corners and edges, you should increase the incision a little if they do not come out like this. If they do not come out in this way, then you must grasp them with a firm grip, having one end of it like a blunt instrument.
So as to hold on to the stone and not let it slip away, or else enter a gentle instrument with a pointed end underneath it. If you cannot manage it, then widen the incision slightly. And if something of blood gets the better of you, stop it with a sponge.
And if there is more than one, then push the large ones into the opening of the bladder first, then cut on them, and then push the small ones afterwards. And do the same if there are more than two. If they are very large, know that it is not good to make a big incision on them because you will be exposed to one of two bad outcomes.
If he dies, or if there is a constant dripping of urine in order that the place does not unite at all; but try to push it until it comes out, or make an incision with forceps until it comes out completely.
If you have finished your work, wash the wound with vinegar and patience, and apply a compress soaked in oil, wine, or sweet-scented paste, and cold water to calm the hot swelling; then the patient should lie on his back and the bandage should not be removed until the third day.
If the wound has become loose and oozes water and oil, then treat it with the Aleppo ointment and the Bassian ointment until it heals; but if an additional hot swelling appears in the wound, such as blood freezing in the bladder and urine being prevented from flowing out, recognizing this by the exit of blood along with the urine.
Then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption of the bladder and its perforation; then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all kinds of treatment suitable for each case until it heals.
It is necessary during all the stages of treatment to bind the thighs and join them together to fix the medicines that are applied to the place; if the stone is small, has settled in the urethra, has become lodged there, and urine flow has been prevented from exiting, then remove it by applying what I have described before it reaches the passageway.
I have often dispensed with this treatment and resorted to the passageway, namely by taking a steel instrument that has the shape:.
Like a triangle, the end being sharp and pointed on wood, then take a thread and bind it to the urethra below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder; then insert the steel instrument into the urethra gently until the instrument reaches the same spot as the stone.
You guide the catheter with your hand in the same stone a little little as you make a hole in it until it passes through to the other side, then the urine flows from its mouth. Then you hold your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis, for it breaks apart and comes out with the urine, and the patient is cured.
If this treatment is not accessible to you due to an obstacle that hinders you from it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone, then cut through the stone in the same penis between the two threads, then pull it out.
Then release the knot and clean the stagnant blood that has accumulated in the wound, and it is necessary to tie the thread under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other knot above so that when the thread is released after the stone comes out, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, it is necessary for you if you tie the upper thread to lift the skin above so that it returns when you release your hold and covers the wound as we said.
The 31st Section.
For the Removal of Stones in Women.
Only rarely do stones form in women, and if one of them does develop a stone, then it is difficult to treat her and many obstacles arise, for example, the woman may be a virgin, and secondly, you will not find a woman who opens herself up to the doctor.
If the woman is a virgin or one of those related by marriage, and thirdly, you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially when it comes to manual work, and fourthly, the location of the incision on the stone in women is far from the location of the stone so that it requires an internal incision.
And in that, there is a risk; if necessity demands it, then you should take a good and experienced female doctor, and rarely are they found. If not, ask for a chaste and companionable doctor, or have a woman present who has some knowledge of this craft regarding women's affairs.
Open the woman's legs and command her to make all that she commands her to do in examining the stones or first, so look if the woman is a virgin then it is necessary to insert the finger into her vulva and examine the stones. If you find them and press them under your finger.
Then command her to split it open, if she is not a virgin and was married then command the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vulva and examine the stones after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If you find them, then you must lead them down from the mouth of the bladder to the lower extent of her capacity until it reaches the root of the thigh, then split her open at the side of the vulva near the root of the thigh from any direction she may incline and feel the stone in that area.
And her finger does not move from the stone, compressed under it. Let the incision be small at first then let the instrument enter into that small incision if she feels the stone and increases the incision to the extent that you know the stone will come out of it, and know that types of stones are many.
Some are small and large, soft and hard, rounded and long, curved and branched. Know their kinds so you can infer from that what you want. If bleeding occurs, leave it in the place where the dust is washed away and hold it for a moment until the bleeding stops then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, and do what I mentioned to yourself with the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones from men so you can rely on them in your work. If bleeding occurs and you know that the pulse is from a severed vessel, put the dressing on the place.
And secure it with compresses securely and leave it alone, do not touch it, and let the stone remain, for if the woman dies, then treat the wound. If after days the bleeding subsides and the place becomes healthy, then return to your work until the stone comes out.
The 22nd Chapter.
On the incision for an artificial bladder.
The artificial bladder is a gathering of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin surrounding the testicle and is called the sacrum, and it can be prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
Until one thinks it is another testicle and there is between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane which we mentioned, but that will not be except in rarity; and this artificial bladder is generated from weakness which exposes women to it, and this matter settles on them, and sometimes it may expose women to a blow.
And this moisture is of many colors, either its color is yellowish, or it is reddish bloody, or it is blackish purplish, or it is whitish watery, and most often it is. And the signs by which it is recognized.
Where the moisture gathers, then it is if it is in the white membrane which we mentioned, the swelling becomes elongated towards the length a little like an egg shape and does not show the testicle because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special sac, then the swelling becomes elongated towards one side of the testicle.
So it seems to man that it is another testicle, and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane then it can be felt, but if you want to know the color of the moisture, cut open the swelling with a square cloth which we showed its shape earlier, and what comes out after the cutting is judged according to what is inside.
So if we go to the treatment with iron, it is necessary for the physician to order bleeding if he can do so, and after seeing his body filled, then he will lie on his back on something high a little and you will sit at his left.
You order a servant to sit on your right, stretching his penis towards one of the sides of the scrotum and towards the direction of the navel. Then, take a broad retractor and cut open the scrotum from the middle to near the anus.
The incision becomes straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum into two halves until it reaches the white visceral sac. It is then dissected and preserved from being cut open, and the dissection should be from the side that adheres to the testicle more. The dissection should be made as deep as possible.
Then, fill the sac with a wide layer of fat and let out all the water. Then, separate the edges of the incision with sutures and stretch the sac upwards without touching the scrotal skin containing it. Cut the sac as much as you can, either in one piece or in fragments.
And especially on the delicate side, for if you do not make a thorough cut, the water may return. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin while you are working, then once you have finished cutting the sac, turn it back and sew together the edges of the scrotal skin with suturing.
Then, treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is damaged due to another disease, it is necessary to ligate the vessels inside the sac fearing bleeding, then cut the spermatic cord from the scrotum and remove the testicle, and then treat it as mentioned earlier.
If the fluid accumulated in both sides is equal, know that they are alike. Cut open the other side as you did with the first one, whether it takes one operation or not. Then, clean up the blood.
Then, insert a piece of wool that has been saturated in oil or rose oil into the incisions. Make it come out from outside another piece of wool that has been saturated in wine and oil, spread it over the testicles and navel, and place on top folded cloths which are the remedies. Bind it above with the strap which has six branches on this picture:.
Then two garters are taken, sewn and stuffed with loose wool on this model, and the extremities which it is wrapped around are made of cotton or damp wool, and gathered together by pulling tight into a belt for the trousers, and one of the extremities takes hold at the back to the seat.
And the second one takes hold towards the hip, and both extremities on the thighs from below, and the remaining two extremities on the armpits, and gathers all the pulling together into a belt for the trousers, and this bandage can also be made with linen instead of iron sewing.
And it is that one takes a thin skin scraper, and uses it to scrape the scrotal skin, which is protective as we described until the white peritoneum containing water is exposed, then take another scraper on this picture:.
And it resembles the Greek eye, then wrap with that peritoneum and is protective until all the moisture comes out, then spread the peritoneum with oil and scrape off with the scraper the containing layer and cut it according to what you can, until all of them are removed and preserved from the egg so that it is not touched by fire.
And know that this work is safer and farther from bleeding and better than the sewing, for if you encounter difficulty in sewing or stitching or a warm abscess or bleeding or anything else, then you should treat each of what you encounter with the treatment that is suitable for it as mentioned.
For if the patient is impatient and cannot tolerate this work due to its difficulty, let him use the poultice as I have described it, and if he gets better with what we mentioned from the proofs.
That the bandage is watery, so it is necessary for the patient to sit on a high chair then wrap the swelling at its base with a broad cloth and make the opening wide enough until all the water drains out then place cotton wool on the spot and bind it.
The water is poured on the wound, then it is treated until the cut heals. If there is a discharge of water while compressing it and not because of the white membrane obstructing the mouth of the wound preventing the water from coming out.
Then it is necessary to insert a goose quill or the instrument used to extract water from the hydatids, whose image has been mentioned or increase the opening of the wound slightly.
And know that the water may return and gather after six months or so. If it gathers, compress it on the same spot and the patient will defend his life.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
In the wound on the fatty flesh and its treatment.
Know that the wound on this fatty flesh is often a fatal wound in most cases, so we leave it and consider it safe from danger. And I mention the treatment of it and its types of ulcers.
And I say that many ulcers occur in the bodies of those who are to be castrated, and this is due to various causes, either from a scrofulous humour that inclines towards the testicles or from an injury. The color of the ulcer will be the same as the color of the body and it does not have water.
And the ulcer will be gangrenous and perhaps it will be discolored, red or inflamed and without sensation. It may occur from complicated veins and their swelling, as was mentioned earlier, or from swelling of the arteries. Whatever is the cause of the swelling, it will be recognized by the decomposition of the ulcer.
If you compress it with your fingers and it should not be exposed at all. And if it is due to swelling of the arteries, then nothing decomposes when compressed by the fingers. This type can sometimes burst open on itself and on all the flesh.
He should cut the skin of the scrotum, then stretch the testicle upwards and bring it out from the white peritoneum. He should free the spermatic cord from the vessels and bind the vessels. He should then cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle is stuck to those fleshy growths.
He should bring out the testicle and cut it, and if there is adhesion between something from the peritoneum or among the vessels, he should free all that adhesion and cut it into circular pieces.
If the fleshy growth is in the location of adhesion, which is from behind, he should cut it all and bring out the testicle as we said. When you have finished, dress the wound with a wet compress of rose water and wine, then treat it with other treatment until it heals.
The Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of strangulated hernia.
It is a tumor that forms from twisting and resembles an orchid, similar to the relaxation of women's vaginas, which prevents the patient from moving, exercising, and walking. In the treatment of this disease, it is close to what has been mentioned previously.
But it is necessary to mention what the previous ones did, and I say that the patient should sit on a high stool then push the spermatic cord downwards and hold the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels which are close to the penis.
And someone else should hold it (the skin) on your behalf and stretch it tightly, then cut with a broad and sharp knife, making an incision parallel to the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then remove it from all sides as I mentioned to you about excising the veins in the groin area, and insert a needle with a double thread into it.
You bind it in the first places where it has been cut and also in its end, then you cut it in the middle a cut standing on the length of the body and bring out what is gathered in it from impurities and bad liquids.
Then you treat the opening with the treatment of all surgeons that intend to produce a time for the vessels which nourish one of the uteruses, so it is not bad to do so. If the uterus exposes all the vessels, then one of the uteruses should come out with the vessels lest the food supply be cut off. Before cutting the vessels it atrophies and is not nourished by.
The 47th chapter.
In the treatment of the urethral stricture.
The occurrence of this stricture is from a cut that opens in the omentum extended on the belly, about two-thirds of the distance from the navel to the pubic bone, and then the urethra protrudes from that defect into one of the uteruses.
And this defect is either from a cut in the omentum or from its extension, and these two types of reasons occur frequently due to a blow or fall or shout or lifting something heavy and so on. And its sign if it is from the extension of the omentum that it occurs little by little over a long time.
And it does not occur suddenly and the swelling is steady towards the depth before the omentum presses on the urethra, and its sign if it is from a cut in the omentum that it occurs with great pain at first and the swelling appears differently under the skin nearby.
And that is because of the urethra's exit and its fate to come out outside the omentum, and sometimes it comes out with a hernia, which is called this stricture urethral and hernial, and it may be accompanied by wind, and if there is a blockage in the urethra and it stops there, then the patient will perish.
Because a severe pain and constriction occur, especially if it happens during the afternoon, and treatment of this kind by iron is dangerous, so one should beware of falling into it. The prescription for treatment is that the patient should insert his finger into the hollow part of his body if he wants to return.
Then he will lie down on his back between your hands and raise his legs. Then, stretch the skin that is over the pubic area upwards and cut all of the scrotal skin by its length. Then, insert instruments into the incision as much as needed to open it with them.
And the incision will be as much as needed to bring out the testicle. Then, peel away the peritonaeum that is under the scrotal skin until the white and hard peritoneum is exposed from all sides. Then, insert your index finger into what follows the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum that is under the scrotal skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesion that is behind the testicle. Then, bend with your right hand into the scrotal skin and at the same time stretch the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand and lift the testicle with the peritoneum to the side of the incision.
And instruct the servant to lift the testicle upwards. Then, release the adhesion that is behind it completely and search with your finger to see if there is anything twisted in the white peritoneum. If you find something, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum that is under the scrotal skin, near the incision. Then cut off the ends of the thread until there are four threads. Then tie some of them to each other in a knotted way and bind with the peritoneum that we said is under the scrotal skin, tightly from two sides. Then also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Unless it is exposed, a hot tumor will also form and a second ligament will be formed outside the first one, away from it less than two fingers' breadth. After these two ligaments, a section ofomentum will be taken under the skin of the scrotum, the size of a finger's bone.
Unless it is exposed, a hot tumor will also form and a second ligament will be formed outside the first one, away from it less than two fingers' breadth. After these two ligaments, a section ofomentum will be taken under the skin of the scrotum, the size of a finger's bone. And the rest is all cut off on a roundness and removed with it, then a incision is made below the scrotum's skin, a wound that bleeds, and as we described earlier. Then the soaked wool is used in oil and put in the wound, and the ligament that we described is used.
And the white omentum that we mentioned after it is cut, is done so carefully to avoid bleeding. And the ligament is left until it falls off itself. If it does not fall off quickly enough, then warm water should be poured on it and what comes out should be borne with patience until it falls.
Then the wound is treated with all the treatment of wounds until it heals.
The 46th chapter.
In this chronic strangulated inguinal hernia, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron and the ancients mentioned that one should make as we described in the case of a strangulated inguinal hernia, by ligating the vessels after the incision on them gently downwards.
Then an incision is made in the middle and the tumor is treated as it opens up until the vessels are cut and the wound is treated as we described until it heals.
The 47th chapter.
In a hernia that occurs in the groin.
A hernia in the groin, as we mentioned earlier, may occur in a woman and does not descend to the vulva; if it does descend, that is slight and returns at all times.
However, if the time extends, the incision in the intestines will increase until it descends into the crural region and exposes that part of the intestines which is in the femoral sheath as we said. That is because theomentum extends, then it relaxes and retracts the place, and its treatment by tying as I described.
And it may be treated with iron, which is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, then you cut the place of the opening warm and narrow incision to the width of three fingers, then you push aside the omentums under the skin.
Until the white omentum which follows is revealed, you take a needle and put it on the place that comes from the omentum and push it to the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two places coming from the omentum together with stitching one by another.
Then you finish the thread and do not cut the omentum at all, nor touch the bladder or anything else as I informed you in the treatment of intestinal hernias, then treat it with surgical treatment.
If the threads are cut and the wound is cleaned until it heals, then the omentum will contract and the opening of the hernia will not increase.
And tying is better in this position because it is closer to safety.
The 68th chapter.
In relaxation of the scrotal skin.
Often the scrotal skin relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance is unpleasant, so it is necessary for anyone who wants to treat it to make the patient lie on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then brings the two edges together, and if you wish to stitch first the relaxed skin with three or four stitches and secure the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the sutures are removed.
The 70th chapter.
In castration.
That castration is prohibited in our religion.
Therefore, it was not befitting for me to mention it in this book of mine; but I mentioned it for two reasons: one is that if a doctor were asked about it, he should know the treatment for someone who suffered from it, and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our own benefits.
Like camels, donkeys, cats, and similar animals; so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by emasculation or by cutting. And what is done by emasculation is as follows: we sit the animal in hot water until its femininity subsides, becomes soft and droops.
Then calm it down with your hand until it becomes loose and does not respond to touch. And as for castration by cutting, one should grasp the animal, remove its scrotum with the left hand, then tie up the testicles and cut each one separately.
until the testicles come out, then cut them off after they have been scraped clean, leaving no remaining membranes except for the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than the one done by emasculation.
Because emasculation may leave some femininity behind, making the animal's intercourse possible, then treat the wound until it heals.
The 60th chapter.
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite is found in men of two types: one where it appears as a kind of space or fold in the scrotal skin, resembling a woman's genital area with hair, and from which urine may flow from what is in the scrotal skin.
And as for women, one type is found and it is located above the vulva on the perineum like a child's genitals in miniature, reaching outside one of them like a man's penis, and the other two like those of females, and the treatment of these three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women should be cut off that excess flesh until its impression is removed, then it should be treated like any other wound until it heals. As for the second type of man from whom urine comes out in the scrotal skin, there is no treatment nor any hope for it.
Chapter Seventy-One.
In cutting off the clitoris and the flesh resulting from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural order until it becomes ugly and its appearance is repulsive, and in some women it may become so large that it spreads like men's and becomes suitable for coitus.
You should grasp the clitoris with your hand or a forceps and cut it off, without looking at the cutting nor especially at the depth of its origin lest blood flow.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals, and as for the flesh that grows, it is a flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus until it fills it.
And perhaps it emerges outside like a tail. Therefore, some people call this disease the "tail-like" illness. It is necessary to cut it off like the clitoris and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In treating stricture.
Stricture is when the woman's vulva is not perforated or the perforation is small, and it is either a natural phenomenon born with it or acquired. The acquired kind is caused by an illness that has progressed, which is excess flesh that has grown.
Fragile or thick, it may be in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it. It prevents coitus and bandaging and childbirth, possibly even menstruation, and recognition of that is by inspection from the woman.
If the blockage is apparent and near, then if it's not apparent, search for it with her fingers or a probe. If the blockage is from a fragile thread and is close to the cervix, begin its cutting by placing something like a sponge on the cervix, then put your little finger from both hands together.
And the woman lies on her back with her legs spread, then stretches the cervix with force until she cuts through the fragile membrane and opens the blockage. Then she takes a piece of cloth, dips it in oil, and puts it on the spot, and has intercourse with the woman every day so that the spot does not become stuck again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it is necessary to cut it with a broad knife resembling an aspen leaf. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown, tie it off with sutures and cut it off. And have with you medications that stop bleeding without causing harm like calomel, celandine, and lapis lazuli mixed with white of egg.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not become stuck quickly. Hold it for days and then use a cloth bandage made of dry linen, and treat with all the means of treating an ulcer until it heals. And if there is a growth in the uterus in this form, cut it off in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor that is in the uterus will not respond to iron at all.
The Third Seventy Section.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, piles, and red boils that appear on the vaginas of women.
Hemorrhoids are an inflammation of the mouth of the veins until much blood flows out from it constantly. If hemorrhoids become prominent, they become varicose, and we mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What is cured by treatment and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and varicose if they are in the depth of the womb and do not appear to the sensation, there is no treatment with iron. What is in the mouth of the womb is felt and it is the one that is treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cold room, then to wrap the varicose with a poultice or a rough cloth and cut it from its roots, then apply it when bleeding occurs from one of the veins that stop blood from flowing.
Like senna, chicory, and similar things, then lift her feet to the wall for a moment, then lower them in cold water. If the bleeding persists, sit her down with Samagan's broth, pomegranate rinds, and similar things. Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise tie a firm bandage and breast binder without condition. Then take a soft cloth, dip it in turpentine sap or placenta sap or prickly ash sap with a decoction of gallnut, and secure the place.
If the swelling subsides, treat the place with ointment until it heals. As for the red boil, it is like the heads of the thistle in appearance, rough to look at, and it is necessary to cut off what appears from it according to what I mentioned about varicose veins, whether or not it heals.
The Seventy-Fourth Chapter.
In the swelling that appears in the womb.
There are many kinds of swellings that may appear in the womb, such as cancer, hard swelling, ulcers, pustules, eating sores, warts, hemorrhoids, varicose and hot tumors, and I mentioned all these diseases and their types and signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this article the hot tumor that appears in the uterus if it is one of the tumors that gather duration, how its edges should be treated with iron. If the pain of the tumor is sharp at the beginning with blows, inflammation, and fever.
I saw that if the sensation falls on him, do not hasten to treat it with iron and treat it as it is indicated for maturation until these symptoms cease. Then it is necessary for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean against her back.
And she should bring together her legs to the lower part of the belly, and her thighs should be separated, and her arms should be under her hips, and tie them with a strap suitable for that.
Therefore, the midwife then sits on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the uterus which is depicted afterwards. It is necessary if you want to use this instrument to estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters through the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
It is necessary for the handle to be bent, if the instrument exceeds the depth. Then it should be placed a wedge on the edge of the uterine neck to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. It is necessary for the string that runs in the instrument to be from the upper side.
And you should hold the instrument and have the servant guide the string until it opens the uterine neck. If the abscess appears and is touched by the hand, and the membrane is thin, then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad knife, if the time has been exhausted.
It is necessary to put in the wound a linen thread, soaked in rose oil or green oil with some grip, and put the thread outside from the incision in the uterine neck. Then tie it from the outside on the uterus and on the os with pure white wool, soaked in water that has been boiled with Khabazi.
Then it is treated after two days with the ointment that is suitable for that until it heals.
And it may be washed with the womb and the wound by being irrigated with water and honey, then with hot water in which a senna or long turmeric has been soaked, and then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the womb.
Therefore, it should not be treated with iron but rather treated as mentioned in the division.
The Seventy-Fifth Section.
In the instruction of cauterization, how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural shape.
It is necessary for the cauterizer to know first the natural shape of childbirth and its signs, if you see the woman leaning down and stretching to breathe in and her belly as it should be.
And hasten the exit of the child, know that this childbirth is natural and its exit is on his head and the placenta with him or hanging from his navel; if you see these signs, it is necessary to cut open her abdomen so that the child may exit quickly.
For if it comes down on his head, the placenta comes down with him and is cleaned from those filthinesses with a good cleaning; and all except this childbirth is unnatural and censurable, because the child may come out on its feet and its hands before its head and feet.
And one hand or one foot may come out, or his head and one hand may come out, or he may come out curled up, and perhaps he may turn over on his back and similar unnatural shapes; therefore the cauterizer should be sharp-witted about all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I explain each shape and how to manage it in order to be guided by that and stand firm, if the child comes out on his head, the natural exit, and the woman's effort is strengthened and her breathing becomes difficult; when you see her strength has weakened, sit her down on a chair and instruct the women to support her.
How many mothers it has treated with cooked olive oil and wet cloths! Then the midwife inserts a small forceps between her fingers, cuts open or cuts off what is necessary, until the fluid inside is drained and the woman's womb is exhausted, causing the fetus to descend.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with a warm poultice of olive oil and sesame seed. Then she should be instructed to undress and inhale powdered cumin, while grasping her mouth and nose; for then the fetus will emerge from its time, if it emerges first, the child's hands should be gently guided back in.
If it does not enter, the woman should be placed on a stool and lift her legs up high. Then she should shake the stool on the ground and the woman should hold herself so that she does not fall with the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut off the hands and draw out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie its hands with a cloth and draw them out gently. For the fetus will emerge, emergence of the fetus on the legs; if the fetus emerges on the legs, it is necessary to push them up, then turn the fetus slightly, slightly until it is straightened, then take one of its legs and stretch it slightly.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to undress and inhale powdered cumin; for it will emerge. If it does not emerge as we described, then gently turn the fetus slightly, slightly until it is in its natural shape. For it will emerge at that time with a smooth emergence; if all of what we described fails.
Take from the olive oil's residue, olive oil's residue, sesame seed's ointment, and dissolved gum; strike all of them well in a mortar. Then pour it into the woman's private parts and lower abdomen, then sit her in warm water until she reaches the pubic area.
If you see that it has descended below her, make for her a poultice from mustard and let her wear it. If the poultice is loosened, wait an hour then sit her on a stool, then blow on her nose and mouth, and press down below her navel gently, so that the fetus emerges from its socket, with the emerging of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this condition, place your hands on its knees a little at a time then the woman will lie on her back and stretch out her legs down while she is leaning on the bed and holding onto her hands, then press above her navel a little at a time. Then, remove the covers from under her legs until it is exposed at the bottom. If the fetus does not emerge, take both of her legs and move them strongly then press above the hips a little at a time until the fetus ascends to above, then the attendant will put her hand in and wrap up the fetus a little at a time.
And order the woman to undress until the fetus emerges, with the emerging of the fetus entwined and wrapped around one of her hands, place your hand in redrawing it; if she is unable to draw it back, then support the woman and make her walk; if she is unable to walk, then have her lie down.
Her bed and shake her legs strongly then use the cloth that I described from the remedies; if it takes hold, then sit her on a stool and treat by redrawing the hand and settling the fetus into its natural shape, then let the woman blow and order her to undress until she emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on her back with its hands outstretched and its face towards the back of its mother, it is necessary for the attendant to grasp the hand of the fetus then turn it a little at a time and wrap it gently. If it settles, then carry it to her breast as we described from the oils and remedies.
Then move her a little, a little. If you do that, make her sit on the chair and tell her to bend towards the right side. Then make her undress and blow into her mouth with cinder, for it emerges, the baby standing upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this condition with the placenta, then cut open the placenta with your fingernails until it is free from moisture. If it is stuck on the face or neck of the baby, cut it away from the placenta so that it does not suffocate and die. Then push the baby inside until it is in its proper place.
And order the woman to undress repeatedly, for it emerges with ease, like the birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born and may be three or four, and they live, except that this is rare. As for five, it is something outside nature, they do not live at all.
And surround them, even if they are many, with a single placenta, and separate them by thin partitions between each one of them, attached to the womb of each one. And it may emerge like the birth of a single fetus naturally and easily, or emerge in a manner we have described as reprehensible.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we described, unnatural forms that require attention. And be gentle and do what you do with care and attention, and consider each shape and devise a means leading to safety for it.
Mention what is conceived in the womb of fetuses, which fall. It may conceive one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and more than ten, and I have heard that a woman has miscarried fifteen all of whom were conceived like this.
With the knowledge of the All-Mighty, Omniscient One, all this should be known to the midwife so that when it happens to her one day, she can meet it with what is required.
The Sixth and Seventieth Chapter.
On the Delivery of the Dead Fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus as mentioned in the division of treatment and it has not come out, and necessity compels you to act by hand, then look; if the woman is strong and free from any symptoms that would cause harm, it is necessary for her to lie on a bed on her back.
And her head should be leaning downwards, and her legs lifted high, and a servant should hold her firmly from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move when the fetus is extracted.
Then he moistens the cervix of her womb with wet cloths, with the juice of the Cynodon dactylon and saponaria, and with the fat of flaxseed. Then he anoints her palms with these cloths and juices. Then she enters the womb gently, then asks for a place where she can grasp the remains of the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Look, if the fetus is twisted, so that it comes down on its head, then grasp the remains in its eyes or in its shoulders or in its mouth or in its nostrils or beneath its chin or on its scalp or in the nearby places near the ribs or beneath the armpits.
And if it comes down on its feet, then in the hip and middle ribs, and it is necessary to grasp the remains with the right hand and to turn it between the fingers of the left hand, and to enter the hand gently and grasp the remains in some of those places which we mentioned.
until it reaches something empty, then grasp another or a third instrument opposite to it if needed, so that the traction is even and does not incline towards one side; then pull steadily in all directions.
to make it easier to extract, as one does with the teeth when extracting a bone; and it is necessary in between that to relax the traction if it resists from one side; then anoint the patient's fingers with the ointment and enter them from that side to turn it back and forth. And if some of the fetus comes out, move the instruments to other places.
Here is the translation:
When the fetus' head is in the wrist or elbow, then one should do the same thing in the other hand and legs. If the fetus' head is large and there is pressure on it for exit or water has accumulated in its head, one should insert a sharp forceps between the fingers.
And with it, one should tear or extract the head, or crush it with the instrument called "al-mashdakh" which is depicted along with other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
One should do the same thing if the fetus has a large head naturally. One should then cut open the skull or crush it with al-mashdakh as we said, and then extract the bones with calipers. If the head comes out and pressure is applied at the navel, one should cut until the moisture in the chest subsides.
Then the chest will be joined. If it is not joined and there is no exit, cut as much as you can. If it's at the lower abdomen or warm with inflammation, then bind it until the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is on its legs, then pulling it out and aligning it with the mouth of the uterus is easy. If pressure is applied at the abdomen or chest, then pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside it drains.
If you have extracted all the organs and pulled out the head, then wait for the placenta to come out. If the mouth of the uterus is open, then enter your left hand into the neck of the uterus, ask for the head with your fingers, and pull it out by the fingers until it reaches the mouth of the uterus, then insert a forceps or two and pull it out with it.
If the mouth of the uterus has become closed and hot, then do not force it, but rather at that time use wet and thick substances to soften it, and use compresses and sit in the waters that have been poured and warmed.
If the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it can be corrected. Otherwise, cut and remove it. Nothing from the placenta should be left inside at all. Once you have finished treating your patient, use what we mentioned earlier for treating hot tumors that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, then go down into the compressing water and use the rest of the treatment. I have seen a woman who had given birth to a stillborn fetus and then became pregnant with it again.
Then the other fetus died as well. After a long time, an ulcer appeared in her womb and swelled until it burst and started to discharge pus. I was called to treat her and treated her for a long time without the wound healing, so I applied some strong lotion to it.
Then a bone came out from the place, and after some time another bone came out. I was amazed by this because the abdomen is a place where there are no bones, and I thought that it must be from the bones of the deceased fetus. She examined the wound and removed many bones from the skull of the fetus.
And I did not cease to follow this until she removed many bones from her. The woman was in the best of conditions and lived like that for a long time, discharging pus from the place, and that is why I have come here with this rare case.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what a physician may attempt to do by hand in treatment.
The Seventieth Chapter.
In which are the images of the instruments that one needs for extracting the fetus.
Image of a forceps with which to open the mouth of the uterus:.
This instrument, with which the books are bound, whether it be a forceps at both ends of two wooden handles or not, this forceps should be softer than the instrument and be either from ivory or from the wood of the box tree, and each piece of wood should be about the width of two fingers.
And the two reeds are shaped like a finger and their length is half a palm and in the middle of the two reeds there are two pegs from the same kind as the reed itself, whose length will be half a palm or slightly more and width will be like two fingers or slightly more and these two pegs.
They are the two that enter the womb's mouth to open it with them when you set aside the two flaps, likeness of another instrument more gentle and finer:.
It is made from the wood of the ebony or beech on the shape of a calipers except that it has at its end two pegs as you see, length of each peg is about a palm and width is like two fingers, so if you want to open the womb with it.
Then the woman sits on a mattress, spreading her legs apart between her thighs, then you insert these two pegs into the womb's mouth while holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs, and then open your hand with the instrument as you do with calipers, whether to the extent you want to open the womb. Until you make what you want, likeness of another flap mentioned earlier:.
Image of the syringe by which the fetus is pushed:.
Image of the forceps by which the head of the fetus is pulled:.
It resembles the clipper with teeth on one end as you see, and it can be made rectangular like calipers on this shape as you see, having teeth like a saw that cuts and smooths:.
Image of a syringe also:.
Image of a forceps:.
This forceps is thick slightly so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it, Image of a forceps with two handles:.
Image of two broad scissors to cut the fetus:.
All these instruments, the more their kinds multiplied and were prepared by the craftsman, the faster was his work and the higher in esteem among people due to its need, so do not despise having one prepared for you, for it is necessary.
The 78th chapter.
The extraction of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, then it is necessary for the midwife to grasp herself and then blow on the placenta while pulling your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out like this, otherwise take a cloth.
And make a hole in the cloth, then put the open herbs like fumitory, senna, dandelion, babbington, and silicified into it. Then soak them in water and carry them to the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole of the cloth, with one end at the mouth of the uterus.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then breathe as we said. Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it does not come out after this treatment, order the midwife to put her left hand in a mixture of cow's gall or gum arabic.
Then put it into the abdomen and search for the placenta. If she finds it, grasp it and pull it out a little at a time until it comes out. If it is stuck in the depth of the uterus, enter your hand as we described, until you find the placenta, then pull it out gently.
So that the uterus does not fall when pulled strongly, but it is necessary to move it gently to the right and left sides, then increase the pull. Then it will respond and release its attachment. If the mouth of the uterus is constricted, we have described the treatment by blowing, the treatment with the cloth, and the herbs.
If it does not come out with everything we have described, then do not use force on her in the retraction. But it is necessary to bind what has come out to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh, and then anoint it with the quadrangular ointment. It will heal after a few days.
The wound heals and emerges except that if it becomes infected, then a bad odor spreads to the stomach and head and that illness requires suitable smoking.
Therefore, some of the early ones have tried the smoke of herbs and dry trees, the shape of the instrument with which the woman blows when her menstruation and childbirth are delayed and similar things:.
It is made of lead resembling a pipe or it is made of copper, with the thin end in front and the wide end on the fire and the incense is burned until that incense goes away and another one is repeated.
The Seventy-Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of unruptured hemorrhoids.
Many boys may be born and their hemorrhoids not ruptured, but blocked by a thin membrane, so the wet nurse should pierce that membrane with her finger, otherwise she should bind it tightly with a sharp cloth and warn the muscle not to touch it.
Then she puts a soaked wool cloth on it, in the drink and oil, then treats it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, she should put a lead tube into the puncture for many days and remove it when the child wants to have a bowel movement.
And also the constriction of hemorrhoids can occur as a result of wound or abscess, so that constriction should be cut open and then treated with what we mentioned earlier in terms of treatment and medication.
The Eightieth Chapter.
In the treatment of fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur below are a complication and thickening that occurs near the hemorrhoids from outside or in one of the spaces on one side, and there may be one or more fistulas.
If that complication opens up and a watery discharge, white or thin pus, comes out of it, which may be connected to the anus and the rectum, and may not be connected, then the connected one will recognize what comes out of it through bowel movement and flatulence when using the enema.
And perhaps it will emerge from there, and maybe it will be a worm if it is in the pelvis extending to the bladder and to the urethra, or extending to the hip joint and to the coccyx. And what is known as the vermiform appendix extending also to the rectum, but not extending.
That you should put your ring finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe made of copper or iron if there is no obstruction in the vermiform appendix, but if there is an obstruction then put a leaden or horsehair thread into it.
Until you feel the probe or thread in your finger, if you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the incision, neither stool nor gas nor worms as we said, then know that it is not extending and hasten to treatment.
And if the vermiform appendix extends to the bladder or to the urethra, its indication is the discharge of urine from it and its refusal to cohere with medicines. And if it extends to the hip joint or to the coccyx, its sign is the reach of the probe to that place.
If there is no obstruction to the bone and there is pain in that direction, and pus constantly comes out of it, and no treatment works nor does it cohere with ointment, and all these extending vermiform appendices are incurable.
And the treatment of it is futile trouble for whoever undertakes it from ignorant physicians. But as for what is not extending and not chronic, one hopes for its cure with iron, as I have described it and tried it, which is to make the patient lie between your hands on his back.
And you should stretch his legs upwards and incline his thighs towards his abdomen, then insert the copper or leaden probe into the vermiform appendix if there is an obstruction in it until you learn where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the rectum, then you should put your ring finger into the rectum.
If you feel that the amputated finger has been severed from itself, openly and without any tissue or flesh in between your finger and it, then you should be certain that it is severed and do not bother to reattach it because it will not heal as we mentioned.
And they said that it may heal in some people in rare cases, and with the treatment expected to be beneficial for it, wrap a thin cloth on the stump according to the size of the scrotum as mentioned earlier, and place it inside the scrotum until it reaches the thigh, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you learn that all the excess flesh has been burnt, resembling a bird's quill tube, then treat it with anointed lint in lard until those burnt fleshes emerge, and then treat it with ointment, then he will recover.
And if not, it will never recover with anything else, and as for the severed part, if it did not reach your finger which is in the thigh and there was a thick veil of flesh or tissue between it and the severed part, and you saw the scrotum coming out on the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the scrotum. And you will cut through the skin along with the severed part as it is in the scrotum, until you reach where the end of the severed part ends and the severed part lets go and falls, then clean those excess fleshes resembling a bird's quill tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with ointment until he recovers, if the bleeding is severe and hinders you from cutting away those fleshes, do your best and hurry to cauterize it with fire or a sharp remedy, for cauterizing with fire gathers two good outcomes, burning that excess flesh.
Cutting the blood and drying out the moisture, then treat it with a poultice of fat or sulfur mixed with oil until the wound becomes inflamed and the burnt flesh emerges. Then treat the wound with salve that is beneficial for solid tissue.
And these medicines have a grip and dryness; if they settle, it is cured and there will be no relapse. If the wound has reached the depth of the ulcer and is away from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the ulcer and search with it.
If you feel a membrane or a covering of bone or flesh between the edge and the wound, and it is close to the outlet, then there is no way to proceed except through greed and hope. This is by using one of three methods: either to cauterize as we mentioned.
Or else to incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can insert the poultice and treat it from close by, and do not continue to cut lest you cut the surrounding muscle that is around the ulcer, causing stool to exit without control. Then treat it as we mentioned, and perhaps it will be cured as we said.
Or else to pierce that membrane and scrape it after you have incised it close to the ulcer, as we mentioned, either with a scraper or another sharp instrument, then cleanse all the burnt flesh in the incision until you can reach it by searching.
Then fill the entire wound with gauze, including the incision and upper mouth, until it is sealed, leaving the ulcer open inside the ulcer crater, so that it will be less painful for the patient, and sometimes the ulcer may appear in this way.
And when you insert the scraper into the ulcer and it is on one side of the ulcer crater towards the surface of the skin and the edge of the crater, take then a curved scraper like an awl, in this shape:.
And insert into it a slack thread from five threads or approximately that, then insert the retractor by the thread in the navel until it reaches its depth, if it is swollen inside near the seat.
Then withdraw the thread from that hole by inserting your finger in the seat and withdrawing the end of the thread and joining both ends together, tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Every time you cut the thread in the flesh, tighten it well until those fleshes between the threads fall away, then treat the wound until it heals and closes.
If the navel is not swollen, then push it as far as you can without cutting the muscle lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the cauterizing needle that cuts through the navels is such that the cutting part is very sharp and the other side is not sharp, lest it cut what does not need to be cut as you see.
Eighty-first chapter.
In the veins of hemorrhoids which bleed and are cut, and treating fissures.
The hemorrhoids will be in two forms, either they will be inside the seat resembling red pimples or like bunch grapes and they will be small and large and blood will flow from them constantly.
And it will be one and many, and it will be outside the seat at its edges except that those which are outside the seat are in most cases less moist, bleeding yellow water or a little blood constantly, and they will have the same color as the body.
And the treatment for those inside the seat is to order the patient to defecate and strain until the seat comes out and the hemorrhoids appear, then hurry and tie them with thread or grasp them with your finger and cut them at their roots, unless the thread does not hold due to its moisture and relaxation.
Heal it with a rough cloth or a piece of moistened bread or grasp it with your fingers then cut it and leave some sharp ridges on it so that it assumes the shape of the cicatrice or fashion it as mentioned in the chapter on cicatrices.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals, if the ulcer does not yield to coming out then inject the patient with an injection that is a little bitter to wash away what is in the ulcer and hasten its exit quickly when the patient feels relieved, therefore ease the external ulcers and order them lightly.
And it is that you take it with your fingernails or tie it with a thread and cut it then treat it as we mentioned until it heals, and if he dislikes cutting with iron it is necessary to use his vein in this manner, take a loose string and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the boil upwards and remove it with the needle from its root on the other side, twist the ends of the string below the needle as it is obstructed and tighten the boil tightly then tie the string and withdraw the needle, do that to all the boils and leave one not to be removed.
So that excess blood flows out, then place on the ulcer a soaked cloth in rose water or rose oil and put it on the ulcer and order the patient to remain still, then leave him until the boils drop, if they have dropped treat them with ointments and all the treatment until they heal.
And as for the treatment of fissures, it is often exposed to the roughness of the intestines and stubbornness of nature, so if a medicine does not benefit then it is necessary to scrape it with a scalpel or your fingernails until it becomes soft and sheds its upper crust that prevents union.
Then treat him until he recovers as is fitting, if he does not recover then repeat it with increased severity until his flesh becomes soft and his skin peels, then treat him because he will be cured.
The 82nd chapter.
In the treatment of reversed and unreversed arrow wounds, and of ulcers and boils.
For the arrow wound is a rounded swelling on the surface of the body resembling the head of an arrow, which occurs throughout the body but especially in the soles of the feet and palms of the hands and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise what is around the arrow wound, grasp its point or hook and extract it from its origin, then treat him, and if desired, clean him as mentioned in his section. And as for the dry boils, one of them is a small rough flake lying flat on the surface of the body.
And often it occurs in the hands of children, and its treatment is to swell the boil and cut it or lacerate it with a thread of silk or a hair until it falls off, and if desired, clean it with fire or with a harsh medicine.
And the reversed and unreversed boils can be extracted with the instrument that I mentioned in the treatment of the boil, and as for the boil, it is also a small rough flake lying flat on the surface of the body, going deep into it, and if it is affected by cold, one will find in it a resemblance to the itching of the boil.
And it may occur in the entire body, and most often in the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from a swan's feather or a strong eagle's feather and shape that tube around the boil until its circular edge is formed, then turn your hand with the tube until you incise what is around the boil.
And make it in the depth of the flesh and extract the boil from its root, and if you wish to do so with a copper or iron tube in this manner.
The tube will be above the armpit, immobile and slightly open, making it easy to control with one's fingers and open or close it as desired.
The Third Eighty-Ninth Chapter.
In the forms of instruments used for enema in cases of constipation, diarrhea and colic.
The enema may be made from glass, or from copper, or from bronze, hammered or not, and it can be made small or large according to the users. So the ones used in treating young children will be small and those who have narrow or constricted anal openings will need a very thin enema, as follows: Large Enema.
The upper part of the strap that ties it will be wide and has a barrier where the strap is tied as you see, and its lower part that enters the anus will be immobile and very smooth to the armpit in one side, with two holes and one hole on the other side.
The width of the hole will be as thick as a finger or slightly thicker, and the strap that is used to put medicine into it from an animal's bladder or a goat's gut will be made in the shape of a small saddle, with a diameter of about a span.
And it will have many holes, as if it were spinning, with a thickness of about the width of a finger between each hole, then a thread tightly wound from wool spun from ten or so threads will enter those holes and gather with the strap like a saddle. So if medicine is put in it, tie it tightly at the top of the enema between two stones then inject with it, and this is the shape of the strap and hole.
And how to retain the medicine in the armpit or bladder, that it be filled with the medicine while being applied above the capacity of the patient and beware that it not be too hot or too cold then the patient will lie on their back and stretch out their legs up.
Place a linen or cloth under him, then grease the end of the tube with fat or egg white or with liquid soap or something similar. Then he will insert it into the wound gently. He will take the gauze bandage in his hands together and squeeze it hard until all that is inside the tube comes out.
Then he will remove the tube and wash the patient's legs up to the wall. If the medicine has caused him to pass out, let him stay as long as possible. And if he sleeps through the night, it will be more effective for the swelling. He should inject the remedy into the abscess and hasten its exit so that the injection is complete when he recovers.
If there is a boil or painful swelling in the wound, then make the tube very soft and gentle, softer than the tubes used by children. And this is an image of a soft tube wrapped with skin:.
The 84th Chapter.
In the Treatment of Wounds.
I mentioned in the previous division of treatment that which concerns injuries, and I am referring to its treatment by hand and with medicines on perfection. I say that wounds differ according to what is with the wound and according to where the wound falls.
The things that are with the wounds are many, such as a stone bruise or sword cuts or knife wounds or arrow piercings or stick or spear and so on from many things.
And as for the wounds according to the places of the body, such as a wound that occurs on the head or neck or chest or belly or liver and so on from other organs.
And I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make it a standard and law for all wounds, and I will begin with simple head wounds, especially, because compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third book of this book.
I say: if an injury occurs in the head and it is a simple wound, not a bone fracture, then if it was caused by a stone or something similar and the skin has only been torn and the wound is large and you fear that the patient may develop abscesses, then take a poultice and apply it to the place. And do not delay in doing that and extract blood from him according to his strength, unless a stopper prevents it, especially if the blood emerging from the wound is slight and the stoppage is on the opposite side of the injured part.
And warn the patient against overeating, drinking, and heavy foods, if a stopper prevents bleeding. He should reduce his food intake and not approach meat or drinks containing opium. And apply to the wound a poultice of rose water alone or with opiate drink that contains an equal amount.
And if the abscess is prevented, apply to the wound some of his own blood, as long as it's still fresh and hasn't been exposed to air, like I will describe to you shortly. And if it has been exposed to air, apply some ointments on top of it.
Until the pus discharges, then treat him until he recovers. If the wound is large and caused by a sword or something similar and his lips have not joined together yet, then sew it up as I will describe in sewing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and attached, but its connection is only slight, then cut it off and treat the wound with medicines that will make the flesh firm again in place of the skin. And instruct the patient to eat foods that contain strength, such as heads and tendons and similar things.
If there is gangrene in the skin and it has not attached to the bone, then cut off all the putrid part and wrap it with something. Then treat the wound. If one of the arteries or veins that supplies blood to the area begins to bleed and the bleeding cannot be stopped by medicines, search for the artery.
If he does not stop bleeding, then let him be treated with a caustic and bind him. If necessity demands it, and what we mentioned does not help, then take away until the blood stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple, requiring only to sprinkle this powder on them and they will be healed by their own blood.
Before the air changes it, the powder's formula is that one part should be taken from aloes, two parts from wax, and three parts from either unslaked or slaked lime. All of these are to be ground together, sifted, and applied to the wound, tightly bound until a good dressing forms on it.
And it is secured with blood, then bound tightly from above with bandages and left undisturbed until it ceases to bleed. For as long as it continues to ooze, the treatment will not be effective; but if lime alone is available, that can be used instead, should aloes and wax not be at hand.
And this action can also be performed with vinegar in many large wounds, if it is applied to them and bound tightly, and the wounds are still bleeding freely from their own blood, without being affected by air. However, if air has had some effect on them, especially during the summer time.
There is no meaning in applying this powder as mentioned earlier, except to let it be covered with some ointment or a poultice made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until the pus forms, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
As for the fracture of the bone near the wound, if it is slight, pull it out with a piece of leather. I have mentioned the treatment for head fractures in what remains to be discussed regarding neck surgery; and if the wound is in the neck, there will be no difference in the treatment between this and a simple head wound.
If he has cut a cord from the neck or an artery, then if it is a cord, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with compression like a vice or a tourniquet and similar things because they harm the nerve and tear it.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound whatsoever, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain which is the noblest of organs will be affected. What he uses to treat it from medicinal substances like camomile washed with sweet water, repeatedly anointed with oil or with rose ointment and tamarind.
If it is also washed with sweet water and all the metallic stones in this condition, and soft ointments. And if the wound is large, then use suturing or bring his lips together with thread, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a hollow and in its bottom, pus has accumulated and is flowing into it. If an artery has been cut in the wound and blood begins to flow, stop it or tie it off or compress it if necessity demands that.
If the wound has cut some or all of the tracheal rings and the ligaments have relaxed, gather up the skin flaps with suturing to a ring-shaped piece of the trachea, do not touch the trachea but smooth it out and put it back in its natural shape then tighten it tightly and leave it for days.
Then treat it with ointments that contain astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, open it up. If there are fragments of bone, extract all or as much as possible of what you can and leave the rest alone until the wound has healed and eased, making it easier to remove.
If the wound is fresh, apply to it the powder that we have described. If bone has been exposed in the wound and has become inflamed, treat it as will be mentioned in its place in thoracic surgery and between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see it has pus, then look; if wind comes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it's a battle wound. If not, and it's fresh with her blood, do not put in the first instance herbs nor draw it, lest the blood stagnate in its pus.
He will relapse to the heart and kill the patient. But put in it a poultice that is attractive, and leave it on during the day twice. If you do not have a poultice, put into the mouth of the wound a good cotton cloth to absorb what comes out from the moisture, and let the patient's sleep be on the wound.
There is no need for what gathers in it. And if the wound has been three days or more, and there is neither convulsion nor fainting, nor oppression of the breath, and you see all his conditions are good, know that the wound is healed, and use lint and other treatment until he recovers.
If purulence persists and the stench is always present, know that it has become gangrenous, and treat it from its source. The patient on the wound is not as I described earlier, but if the wound is in the chest or back, treat it as mentioned earlier with suturing.
If it is large or with ulcers, and if it is small, if it has affected the bone and cut out fragments from it, then search the wound and begin to remove those fragments if they are clean. If not, leave them until.
The wound will soften and make it easier to remove them. As for other wounds that occur in all organs, the treatment of them is as we mentioned earlier.
Fifth Section Eighty-Nine.
In wounds of the abdomen and rectal discharge, and sewing it up.
The wound that is exposed to the abdomen can be large or small or medium-sized. The large one may discharge intestines or several intestines, and its introduction and sewing up are harder and more difficult.
The small hernia is also difficult from another aspect, so it is necessary that its reduction be more difficult and the intestine not advance in entering its place except at its hour, it becomes swollen and thick, making its entrance difficult. Therefore, the best hernias are the medium ones because they do not make the intestine's reduction as difficult as these two types.
Know that stitching the abdomen is on four sides, two of which are common to stitching the abdomen and other surgeries of the body, while the other two are special for stitching the abdomen only.
And I describe it to you one by one with explanation and clarification, so I say: if the wound is small and something from the intestine has come out and its return is difficult, this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the hernia as we said, or because the intestine is obstructed in advance by the contraction of air.
So if that is the case, it is necessary to soften it by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water and adding asafoetida and cumin, and then wrap the intestine with it until the obstruction is released.
And it can also be done with the decoction of the herb that contains aloes, and this is better than water alone in releasing the obstruction. If you see the obstruction has released, then put the intestine in a lukewarm bath made from cumin or baker's yeast, and it will slide into its place with ease.
And if it still does not return after this treatment, then split the hernia a little with the instrument used to cut fibers and the first treatment is better than splitting, but only requires splitting when necessary and all other means have failed. This is an image of the instrument:.
Its direction is one-way, limited in one direction and unlimited in the other, and the thin end does not become as sharp as a scalpel but is slightly flared, and it is an instrument similar to a small saw as you see. If the wound opens up and the intestine enters, then its return should be on its natural shape.
If you can manage that, it is better. But if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and lift his legs higher than his head. If it is in the upper abdomen, he should lift his head and chest higher than his belly.
And likewise, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always make sure that the side where the surgery is to be performed is higher than the other side. Thus, it should be done in great operations and middle-sized ones.
And as for small operations, do what you can and then prepare before you a faithful servant to hold the wound in his hands, gather its edges together, and uncover it little by little for the one doing the suturing.
And this is the general method of suturing, which is to take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leave a part of the wound as thick as the nail and insert one needle without entering it into the edges of the skin. With the edges of theomentum underneath the skin from inside, until it is inserted from that side, and having brought together the edges of the skin and theomentum, so that there are four layers. Then tie with a double thread around the needle on both sides, until the edges of the wound come together firmly.
Then leave a part as thick as the finger also and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread like you did with the first needle, and continue to do that as many times as you need needles until you have completely covered the wound, and let the needles be intermediate between thickness and thinness.
Because very thin needles are quickly cut through the flesh and also hard to enter the skin, so it is necessary for them to be intermediate in thickness and thinness. And one should not insert the needle into the edge of the skin too closely.
Unless the flesh is torn off quickly and the wound is not sutured before, nor should it be far from suturing lest the wound prevent healing. Then cut off the tips of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient when he sleeps and make for him a support from torn cloth from every side to hold the tips of the needles.
And leave it until you learn that the wound has healed, and this type of suture with needles is thus more suitable for small wounds because it can be sufficient to suture it with one or two or so needles.
Or the method of suturing for a second ordinary case is that you gather all four layers, namely the skin and the peritoneum, in one shot with a needle having a thread of moderate thickness and roughness, then if this is completed with the needle, you remove it from the side where you started it.
So that the thread is knotted from above the wound, to make the suturing like the way of sewing with silk threads which tie things together and leave a small thickness between each stitch, and this type of suturing is known to everyone.
And with this suturing, I have sewn up a surgery that was presented to a man in his stomach, who had been injured by a knife, and the wound was more than a span long and he had come out from his bed about two spans from the middle of his bed, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
Then I waited for him to recover from his bed outside the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived for many years afterwards, managing all his affairs, and doctors would say that he would never recover at all.
And it is a wonder that I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where there was nothing of medicine, so I would put two layers of gauze on the wound during the day and entrusted its cleaning to honey water until he recovered.
And as for one of the specific types of suturing, I mention what Galen said, that is to start the suturing from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. If the needle penetrates the skin and muscle, then it should proceed in a straight line throughout the entire abdomen.
I left the edge of theomentum on the side where I inserted the needle and penetrated it, then inserted the needle in its other edge from inside to outside on the other edge of theomentum. Then, if I had penetrated it, I would penetrate it again in this same edge from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of theomentum on this side, then insert the needle in its other edge from inside to outside and insert with it into the peritoneum until you reach its edge.
Then, start again from this same side and tie with the edge that is from the peritoneum on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin that is near it, then insert it back into that skin and tie the edge of theomentum that is on the other side with this edge of theomentum.
And withdraw it from the skin that is near it, and do that again and again until you have sewn all the incision on this pattern, and in general, this suturing method is called the suture of the frasers for the fur.
That is, to sew the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin and leave it once on the other side until you are finished, and as for the second specific type of suturing mentioned by Galen, this is his word exactly.
And it is that you sew it on the pattern that some practitioners of medicine sew, by joining each part to its corresponding counterpart in a natural manner, by attaching the edge of theomentum to its other edge and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, as I have described to you.
The needle should be inserted in the peritoneal fold, which is near you from outside and penetrate it into the inside alone, leaving the peritoneum intact. Then the needle should be withdrawn and reinserted from outside to penetrate both peritoneal folds, and then also withdraw it again.
It should be inserted from the inside to the outside in the other peritoneal fold, which is on the opposite side. And this stitch of suturing is better than the common easy suture mentioned earlier, as Galen has written. Some have said that the abdomen can be stitched with two needles. And that is by inserting one thread into both, starting by introducing the needle from your side and piercing it to the other side, then introducing the other needle from the opposite side of it and piercing it from your side according to the stitching of the scaphoids whether.
Know that the rupture in the middle of the abdomen is harder to suture than in any other place in the abdomen. And as for treating the wound, its rule is like that of all wounds, namely: if you have recognized the wound fresh with blood before the air has changed it and have washed it and marked it out and made it neat, then apply the medicinal powder.
If the wound has been changed by air, then apply some ointments that will help it until it heals and the stitches fall away and the peritoneum and folds are reunited, then treat it as you would any other wound until it is healed.
If you don't have medicines, apply the cotton lint as it begins to heal, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it is healed. For in most cases, if the wounds are simple, you won't need any further treatment, unless you fear that the wound may affect the main organs with pain.
It is necessary to soak a linen cloth in moderate heat oil or rose fat and place it around the areas between the armpits and groin, if he feels pain or odor in his stitches then very often this is cured by drinking black vinegar water.
And especially if the odor has spread to his stitches and become a gaping wound in his belly, know that what is thick from the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin is harder to heal.
And as for the sigmoid colon, it does not accept healing from surgery at all, due to the abundance of its blood vessels and their thickness, and the delicacy of its lining and proximity to the nature of the nerve. And if what protrudes from the wound is a thrombus and has been cleansed, return it according to your judgment regarding the colon, whether or not.
If it has gone on for some time and has turned green or black, then it is necessary to tie it off with a thread above the spot where it became black so that bleeding does not occur, since in the thrombus there are blood vessels and sinuses, then cut what is below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread attached from below the wound outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull and remove when the thrombus falls off and the wound heals. Mention the wound which occurs in the colon, but if a rupture occurs in the colon and it is small.
It may be possible for some people to survive due to which I saw a man who had been pierced in his belly with an arrow and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, so the wound became gangrenous and feces and wind were coming out from it, so I treated him without expecting him to heal. So I did not stop treating him until he healed and the wound closed, but when I saw the wound had closed I was afraid that something bad would happen to him in his belly so nothing bad occurred and he remained in the best of states. It is indeed true that he eats and drinks, and cohabits and enters the bath, and submits to his service. Some people of experience have mentioned that whenever he appears with a wound in his private parts and it was small, one should sew on this condition.
And it is that the large ants with their heads are taken, then the wound's lips are gathered together, and an ant is placed from among them with its mouth open on the wound's lips. If it bites onto it and closes its mouth, cutting off its head, then it sticks and does not come loose; another ant is then placed nearby.
And it does not cease to do that with multiple ants in proportion to the wound, then it is returned and the wound is sewn; for those heads remain stuck in the private parts until the private parts heal and are cured, and no evil or affliction whatsoever occurs. And it is also possible to sew the private parts with fine thread.
The one who is released from the tied animal after it enters the needle, that is, to take the end of this thread from the tied animal and cut it off then tie a fine woolen thread around its end and then enter that thread into the needle. And in this case, the thread of the tied animal is used to sew the private parts then it is returned into the body; and this stroke of sewing with ants and thread is only on the way of greed and hope.
But as for if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the sensitive private parts, there is no remedy nor healing whatsoever.
The 68th chapter.
In treating catarrh and nasal ulcers.
Know that every wound or tumor if it becomes old and decrepit, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, is called on the whole in any part nasal ulcers, and we call it catarrh.
He is on the truth, tangled in a hard white bone, with no pain accompanying it, having a cavity like the hollow of a bird's wing.
Therefore, some of them named it "riasha", and it can be in some cases moist, constantly draining pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease in certain times, and this moisture may be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And I have mentioned in the classification when mentioning wounds that not every ulcer heals or puts on good flesh, and it is due to one of nine reasons, either due to lack of blood in the body, or its coagulation, or because there is hard flesh within it and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Either because it is many and thick, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material that fills it is of poor quality, or because the treatment does not agree in its cure, or because corruption has occurred in the region from a type of plague, or because there is something special in the region.
Either because it is many and thick, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material that fills it is of poor quality, or because the treatment does not agree in its cure, or because corruption has occurred in the region from a type of plague, or because there is something special in the region. As has been shown in the city of Zaragoza, where it is difficult for diseases to mature and wounds to heal naturally, either because there is one bone or several bones, and I have pointed out all these causes, signs, and treatments with medicines in the classification.
And here it is necessary for me to inform you about the treatment of boils and pimples that occur through work by hand, know that boils can occur in all parts of the body, some of which end up in great abscesses or sinuses, or in nerves.
or to a fistula or to an anus or to the bladder or to a rib from the ribs or to a vertebra from the vertebrae of the back or to a joint from the compound joints, such as the hand and foot, and some of which end up near a main organ and so on.
What is not from this kind of wounds on this condition then it is from the severe and incurable diseases that do not accept treatment and dealing with them trouble and ignorance, if what is from the wounds did not reach these places which I mentioned and hoped to treat.
And I wanted you to understand that, take a probe made of copper or iron if the wound runs straight, search it with it. If the wound is uneven, search it with a thin lead probe because lead softens its contents.
As you enter and it bends towards the unevenness, if the wound has many mouths, you cannot determine it with a probe. Instead, grasp one of its mouths first, for the moisture that flows into it will lead to the other mouths and flow forth.
From there, then search for any direction in which you can determine if there is a bone or a nerve, or if the wound is deep or near, or if it has one mouth with many mouths, and be aware of all that according to your keen judgment and the presence of pain when you touch the place.
And as for the other signs and causes that occur to the abscess, so if you have stood on all of this with a true understanding then at that time proceed to treatment with confidence, namely, look to see if.
The wound is apparent, near or in a safe place far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein or one of the places I mentioned to you. Cut open the wound as described above and extract what is inside, namely, the pus, rotten flesh, and excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its mouth from flesh or abscess and the like, treat it until it clears up. If the wound is deep-seated and straight, you should cut it open to the depth that you can manage, then clean it of all rotten flesh.
Then use the soaked papyrus in sharp remedies and put it at the bottom of the abscess that can be reached by iron. Do this several times until the sharp remedy eats away all the remaining decay at the bottom of the abscess.
Then apply pressure to it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal, follow the prescription as previously described. If the cause of the abscess is bone and you know that to be so, then cut it open and incise it according to what I have told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
Bone or nerve or main organ as we said, if the bone is revealed to you and it has some decay and discoloration, then remove it until its decay is gone, then treat it with what promotes healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal and pus accumulates as it was doing.
Know that you have not reached all of the decay removal, so uncover everything on it again and excise and clean it with your utmost effort, then apply pressure. If it heals, otherwise know that that decay is deep inside from the decay, so uncover everything on it again.
And excise and clean it with your utmost effort, if the decayed bone is small and you can remove it, then remove it with a thin file that is suitable for that.
If the bones are many, excise and remove all of them, and do not leave any part, exerting your utmost effort. If something gets in your way from those ligaments without danger to cutting it, then cut those ligaments and flesh if there is any, and release the bones.
If it does not become possible for you to remove the bones from your time, then carry what needs to be carried on the wound and leave it for some days until what is around those bones, flesh and ligaments, becomes rotten, and preserve the wound so that the incision you made in the process of your work does not close.
Wrap around it with a mixture of powdered sulfur and oil or a mixture of the Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. If those ligatures become putrid and the bones loosen, it is easy to extract and pull them out.
If a single large bone, such as the tibia or femur, and so on, has decayed except for its surface, scrape it thoroughly with a sharp instrument until the foulness and decay disappear. Then compress the wound. If the decay has reached the marrow of the bone, it must be spread out.
Cut off the entire affected part to where the decay ends. Then, scrape it until it heals and becomes attached. And I inform you of a case that occurred to a man in his thigh as an example and aid for your treatment, this man was young.
Around thirty years old, a man was afflicted with pain in his thigh due to movement within the body until the material spread to the bone and abscessed with a huge tumor. There was no external cause, then time passed along with the mistakes of physicians until the abscess opened.
And many substances flowed from him and his treatment was poor until the thigh became gangrenous and there were many openings, all discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of physicians attended to him for two years, but none among them had skill in hand surgery.
Until he came to me, and I saw his thigh and the substances flowing from those openings like a great flood. The man had wasted away his body and turned yellow in color. So I inserted the probe into one of those openings and it reached the bone, then I searched all the openings.
I found that some of them emptied into each other from all parts of the thigh. So I probed one of those openings and split it open until I exposed some bone. I found it decayed, blackened, and putrid, with holes eaten away to the marrow. Then I spread what was revealed to me.
I enabled the wound's rotten bone and I think that there is no other decay in the bone except what was cut and spread out, and how it was extracted then and I made the edges of the wound adhere with potent medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal then I returned and uncovered the bone again above the first uncovering.
I found the decay connected to the bone, so I spread out what appeared to me also from that decay, then I pressed it back and it did not adhere nor heal, then I uncovered it again and it did not; I kept cutting away at the bone piece by piece and moistening it until it would not adhere even when I cut off about a finger's length.
I extracted it with its membrane, then I treated it with medicines and it healed quickly and recovered; however, this repetition was necessary in his case due to the weakness of the patient and his lack of endurance, and my fear for him since he would often experience excessive bleeding which would fill again and then recover fully.
And in the place of the bone, a hard flesh formed and his condition improved in his body, his strength recovered and he began to move about freely without any affliction affecting him at all; unless the bone was fractured in some part of the body.
So it is necessary to spread it in this shape and take a bandage, to pull it tight on the outer end of the bone and have someone assist you from above, then tie another bandage made of thicker cloth than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and stretch its end down so that the flesh will be pulled down, while you uncover the flesh in the spot where you want to spread it so that the saw does not harm the flesh; then place a board or flat piece of wood firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be able to cut through the rotten bone; and it is necessary for the spreading to be slightly above the spot of decay so that there is no decay in the bone cavity and it does not appear on its surface, forcing you to spread it again.
If the bone is rotten and has not been broken, but some of it connects with other parts and the decay is in its middle or some of it; remove the flesh from all its sides entirely. Then place the board from below and spread it out from the first side where the decay is.
If you have finished spreading it out, spread it out from the other side and make sure that the spreading is a little away from the decay as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut off the rotten part of the joint itself and spread out the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is between two joints, then there is no remedy except to remove it. If the decay is in the thumb or foot, then the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape away the decay as much as appears to you, clean and purify it in any way you can.
And by what means can you successfully reposition it, as long as a ligament or nerve does not obstruct you, and know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are numerous according to the shape of the bones, their position, thickness, roughness, largeness, smallness, firmness, and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each type of work.
And know that the works themselves will guide you as to what instrument you need if you have a long saw and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for one who has mastered the craft and seen many cases of diseases. And he may deduce for himself what instruments to use for each disease, and I will illustrate for you in the end of this chapter several instruments.
Make examples underneath it to follow and measure by means of others, God willing, picture of a saw:.
Picture of another saw:.

The 77th Section.
In cutting off limbs and breaking bones.
The limbs may be affected either from an external cause or an internal one, so if you treated that decay with medicinal treatment and the treatment did not succeed and saw the decay spreading in the member without anything stopping it.
In that case, it is necessary to cut off that member up to where the decay has reached in order for the patient to be saved from death or great suffering, which is greater than the loss of a member. And an indication of this is when the member becomes blackened until you think the fire has burned it.
When the corruption spreads beyond the wound until it reaches another part of the body and takes hold in a general manner, then begin to cut; similarly, if the cause of corruption is due to some kind of vermin such as the sea scorpion or the snake or the lizard, etc.
If the corruption or gangrene is in the tip of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not let the corruption spread to the hand; similarly, if it has taken hold in the hand, then cut it off at the wrist and do not let the corruption spread until it takes hold in the arm.
Similarly, if it has taken hold in the arm, then cut off the arm at the shoulder joint; if the corruption spreads and reaches the neck, do not cut off the neck at all, for that would be fatal to the patient, and instead apply another treatment according to what is possible.
And similarly, do the same with the leg; if the corruption takes hold in the toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it has taken hold in the thigh, cut off the entire leg; if it spreads to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no remedy except to leave it and let the patient succumb to death; as for cutting off the limb or dividing it, tie a strap at the bottom of the place you want to cut and another strap above it.
And have one servant stretch the single strap down, and have another servant stretch the upper strap up, and strip away the flesh between the straps with a broad knife until all the flesh is exposed; then cut or divide. It should be noted from all sides that the linen cloth should be torn.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place and expose the patient to unnecessary pain and hot swelling; if bleeding occurs during your work, stop the bleeding quickly or apply some stopping agents for blood then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the injured member with a binding that is suitable for it and treat it until it heals. And I inform you of an example that was presented to a man on his leg, this very same one which I have described to you. That is, a bruise appeared in his leg with burning like fire.
And that corruption was the first thing to occur on his finger until the man took it all off, and the man cut himself from it when he saw the corruption spreading in the member with the severity of the pain and burning, and then he recovered.
So when a long time had passed, the same corruption appeared on his thumb and he came to me. I applied a dressing to that part with the medications I had brought for his hand after cleaning his body, but the corruption did not stop and continued spreading in another finger.
Until the corruption spread to his hand and I was asked to cut off his hand. I refused, hoping that the dressing would bring relief to that part and fearing also for him if his hand were cut off because the man's strength was on the point of failing. And when I gave up hope he went away to his town.
And it was reported to me that he cut off his own hand and recovered. I narrated this story in order for it to be a warning against what happens in cases like this disease, and as an example to be followed and acted upon.
The Eighth and Eighty-Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medicines.
If a tumor occurs in some of the fleshy members and it lasts for a long time until it reaches its term, then it bursts or boils and all that was inside comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were an empty vessel.
And the skin on it is like a patch that has peeled off and was not severe in its corruption so as to affect bone or nerve or ligament. And for this reason, it deserves to be called an abscess; it should not be called a boil unless it prolongs its term until the corruption affects something from these members.
When that is the case, it is called nassura or zukama. Its treatment is to cut off all of that skin as it devolves and especially if it has become flabby and has become like a piece of cloth and you are certain that it does not adhere to the place for its corruption.
If the skin does not adhere and it has not reached that degree of corruption, and there is a thick layer of fat under it, then use the syringe. It is to look at the swelling; if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul smell, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
What is it that is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and ginger, each part equal, gathered together in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and becomes like the thickness of honey. Then take what you need from it and mix it with water and honey, and inject it into the swelling, and tie up his mouth and leave the medicine there for two hours.
Then remove it with the scraper. Do this for a few days until the swelling is cleansed and the stench goes away, or if this medicine is not available, then inject it with ashes of grape wood or ash of oak wood, by taking the ash and adding water to it.
Then wash it off and inject it with that until you are certain that the swelling has been cleansed. If there is no hope in this case, then use the Egyptian medicine or ashes of grape wood and oak wood, but if not, then inject it with water and honey to which a little crushed ginger has been added.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and the wine adheres to the swelling and especially if the wine contains a good binding agent and coagulant. If you do this several times and are certain that the swelling's corruption has gone away, then inject it with what promotes flesh growth in it.
Like taking the ointment and mixing it with glue, wine and astringent liquid or binding it with some medicines and other ointments that we have mentioned in the article on ointments; if the mouth of the syringe is narrow, it does not fit.
Expand it with a little iron or put in a malleable piece of papyrus, Egyptian ointment or syrian ointment until it fits; and similarly if the mouth is also wide, join its lips together with sutures and leave enough for the syringe to enter without excess.
And similarly if the mouth which discharges pus is elevated upwards, split it in its lowest part so that the pus may flow downwards because if the pus accumulates in the bottom of the syringe it will prevent the flesh from growing inside.
If you cannot split the syringe downwards as you want, make it tilt so that the pus may flow out easily according to what you prefer and ensure that nothing of the pus remains inside at all.
And as for the medicated ointments that are placed on the syringe from outside and how to place them on it, it is that you take one of the medicated ointments similar to what you want and spread it on a linen cloth so that the cloth be long enough to cover the entire syringe. Then cut a slit with scissors opposite the mouth of the syringe, slightly wider than the mouth of the syringe; then spread one of the soft ointments on another cloth to the size of the slit and place it on it in a way that is not opposite the mouth of the syringe so as to make the pus come out easily; and do not remove the large cloth except afterwards.
Several days, and as for that on the mouth of the syringe, it is what you remove every time to make what has accumulated there come out and to know whether what flows from it is much or little or putrid or not.
And with this, inspect the position of the wound itself: whether its owner feels pain there or not; whether it is inflamed or not; whether there is an abscess or not. If you treat it thus and see that the matter that emerges is slight at the mouth of the wound.
Know that the wound has become stuck or almost stuck; then release it on the third day at the latest. When you have dressed the wound, replace the dressing with another and reapply the poultice. If a thin pus emerges from the wound after a long period, do not despair of its closure.
So heal quickly, for some people's flesh does not form well in their wound, and others are contrary to that. If pus emerges from the wound after many days which is not clotted, know that the wound has not healed; if the healing of the wound is slow.
And its extent is long; increase in drying out medicines, and let the medicines be wet in their essence and dry in their force, like the poultice of the white sap if an addition has been made to it. And what cures better with it is that you take the poultice of the white sap.
And it is resolved with a mixture of wax and rose water, then sprinkle the old drink over it, in its essence. Then mix it with it and use it. And you can do this if the poultice of the white sap is not available, by mixing honey well until it becomes foamy and used or taking from the gallnut, patience, and khindar, crushing all together and sprinkling it over the honey while it is on fire. Then spread it on a cloth and apply it to the wound or spread honey that you have mixed well until it thickens, and sprinkle medicines over it, and place the cloth on it and bind it.
And it may be used in the same way with the long ziraun, the root of the Asmanjuni sasoun, and the fine grains of kersennah, or a single, or multiple qantariyun, crushing them and sieving them, and sprinkling them over the honey that you described, and using it. If the wound's condition continues to deteriorate without being healed by this treatment, know that there is decay in its depth.
The treatment of the Naser has a profound effect on the bones, or on any of the hard arteries or ligaments that surround it.
The 88th chapter.
In the treatment of the diseased tongue and gums, amputation of the excess finger and division of the fingers' articulation.
The tongue is a thick mucous that grows under the nail of the thumb or foot, and may grow on other fingers; if it persists and its treatment is neglected, it will become swollen and hot with inflammation.
Or it will putrefy and become foul until it eats away at the base of the nail, or even all of it, and may spread to the bone so that it has a bad smell and the tip of the finger becomes flat and takes on a bluish color; if you treat it as described in the division and your treatment does not succeed.
It is necessary to cut away with iron all the excrescence that grows from the nail, then to cauterize the wound afterwards; for cauterization is very beneficial in this case. As for if the bone is sound and the nail also is sound.
And if the corner of the nail has pushed the flesh inward and caused it to ulcerate and suppurate, then you should put a thin probe underneath the corner of the nail that pushes the flesh and lift it up and cut away that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh burning and caustic remedies until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. As for if the putrefaction has affected the bone, then you should cut away that bone and remove it; for it will not heal as long as there is rotten bone present.
If you see the inflammation and putrefaction spreading in the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints as described earlier, and treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and there is severe pain, then apply a poultice first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp, angled incision from above to below and be careful not to reach the flesh underneath the nail, for this would cause the patient great pain and lead to an excess of flesh in that place. Then treat the area as necessary to alleviate the pain.
And as for the extra fingers that occur in some people's hands, they may be entirely fleshy, or in some cases may contain bones, or even nails and tendons. And sometimes it can grow from the joint of some fingers.
Or it may grow from some joints of the fingers, and those that grow from some joints do not move, while those that grow at the joint of the finger may move. If what grows is only fleshy, it can be cut off easily, by cutting it at its origin with a broad knife.
And as for what grows at the origin of the joint, its treatment is difficult and it is better not to cut it off. But if what grows is on a finger at one of its joints, you should first cut away the flesh in curved cuts up to the bone, then spread the bone with one of those suitable instruments.
Then treat it until it is healed. And as for the fusion that occurs between some fingers, many times this happens and it is a natural occurrence in humans and can occur when an injury or burn and the like occurs, so you should cut through that fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a splint or an opening made of vermilion ointment so that it does not fuse quickly and separate them, or make between them a thin lead plate until the area heals as it should.
And similarly, if fusion occurs between some fingers of the hand, cut through that fusion according to what is needed and suitable for the shape of the limb.
The Ninetieth Chapter.
On Cutting Veins.
The veins are twisted, hard vessels filled with black blood that occur most frequently in the body's members and particularly in the legs, especially in the feet, calves, and hamstrings; therefore, one should first use gentle massage on the body several times.
Then ligate the patient's pulse, and as for treating it with iron, it will be in two ways: one is to cut and extract the black blood, and the other is to remove the sweat and extract it entirely; but cutting is done in this manner: first warm the leg with hot water.
until the thick, black blood is dissipated; then bind the patient's leg from above their ankle to their knee with a bandage; then cut the sweat in one place, or two places, or three wide incisions.
Then use your hand to drain the black blood from the bottom of the leg up and from the top down until you extract as much of it as you can or as much as the patient's strength allows; then bandage him and instruct him to avoid food that causes the black bile and to repeat the purging and phlebotomy.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, but if he is constipated it will be in this manner: wrap the patient's leg with a cloth if there is much hair on it; then immerse his leg in hot water until it turns red and sweat comes out or becomes very dry.
If this does not suffice, then warm the member with a sauna; then cut the skin opposite the sweat in a long incision either at the ankle or lower down at the heel; then open the skin with scissors and remove the sweat from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
He will see it red and bloody when it appears. When he has cleared the skin, he will also see that it is like a vein. Then, he will insert his finger until it rises and comes out of the skin, and tie it with a numb and smooth thread, then cut another incision close to that one about three fingers' width.
Then, he will remove the skin from over the vein until it appears. Then, he will lift it up with his finger as I did and tie it with another thread as I did first. Then, he will cut another incision or many incisions if needed.
Then, he will cut it and cut it at the end of the incision near the ankle. Then, he will pull it out and cut it until it comes out from the second incision. Then, he will pull it to the incision above it and do that until he pulls it out from the third incision on top of all the incisions. When everything has come out, he will cut it.
But if it does not come out to be pulled and cut, then insert a needle with a strong thread, double it, tie it, pull it, and insert your finger under it until it comes out. Take care that it does not break off; for if it breaks off, it will be very difficult for you to cut it.
And he will put it on the patient from that spot. When he has cut out everything, he will apply a soft cloth soaked in wine or rose oil or ointment and treat him until he is cured. If the tendons are twisted with twistings towards any direction.
And if it is not straight as we said, then you must cut on it at every direction of its twistings and places of twisting, and tie it with threads until all of it is tied. And take care when cutting on it that you do not cut the vein or injure it, for it will be very difficult for you to cut it and spare your effort.
Picture of the bone saw with which the canal is cut.
Picture of the blind needle.
It should not have a groove like all needles, nor should the pointed end be sharp lest it cut the flesh and be thick and smooth in its curvature; for if it is thin, it will cut the flesh with its tip, but it should have an advantage of thickness as we said.
The ninetieth chapter.
In the incision of the middle flesh.
This flesh forms in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, and in regions with little arable land; it may also form in other parts of the body besides the legs and is caused by a swelling that occurs under the skin.
As happens in the bodies of living creatures, and boils and carbuncles that develop between the skin and flesh, and the sign of the beginning of this flesh is that it begins to boil severely in the leg, then the place becomes inflamed, and then the flesh emerges from that inflammation.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when one of its parts appears, it is necessary to wrap it around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams, tie it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it is very long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest without cutting it from its root before everything has emerged, for if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, inflammation, and a bad abscess.
Therefore, it should be pulled and drawn out slowly little by little until everything has emerged from its last part, without leaving anything inside the body. Sometimes, this flesh in some people may emerge to a length of five ells and ten.
I have been told that a man has left me with twenty spans, so if he dies on you while you are treating him then insert a rod into his wound and extend it far into the body until everything in it is evacuated and try to clean the area with medicine for days.
Then treat the ulcer with an ointment, and it may be that this ulcer has many roots and especially if it appears on the man's joint or in his leg, he will develop many mouths and from each mouth a vein will emerge which you should apply as we mentioned in the section and as we have previously discussed.
The second ninetieth chapter.
In the cut on the vermiform appendix that arises under the caecum and is known as the cause of cattle.
This disease is known in some of our countries as the cause of cattle, because it often occurs in cattle. It is a small worm that arises between the skin and flesh and spreads throughout the body, rising and falling.
It becomes manifest with itching as it moves from one member to another until it bursts, and where it has burst in the skin, a swelling forms and it emerges, and its contents are like purulence of some of the excretions, as is seen in worms, vermin, and pumpkin in the abdomen.
And it is expected from its severity that if it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it up and emerge, and destroy the eye, which often occurs. If you want to treat it and remove it, then this can only be done when it moves and becomes apparent with itching.
You should tie what is above it and below it with a strong band, then cut through it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, carry out the procedure on the affected area with fire until it burns it, and the most severe damage that can be expected is to the eye as we mentioned.
If you see it has become near the eye in the head, then bind it under the forehead tightly and cut it out and remove it. The patient should be advised to purify his body with soothing medicines for foul humors and beware of nourishments that foster corruption.
The Third Ninetieth Chapter.
In the cut on the patient known as the Nafir.
This disease which is known to us as Nafir, is a pain that appears in some organs and then transfers from one organ to another, and I have seen it as I will describe to you.
I was summoned to a woman patient in some rural areas and I uncovered her arm, and she showed me a slight swelling in the armpit of her arm. When I stayed with her for an hour, I saw that swelling moving up like a worm as it ascends to her shoulder as fast as can be, like pitch.
If it moves from place to place, the pain will depart from that spot and settle in the shoulder, then I sat for an hour and it spread throughout her body until it reached the other arm, then she told me that it is moving all over her body as I witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another and I had not seen this disease with my own eyes in such a form before, except that I saw some people who found pain moving from one limb to another, but I did not see it as I saw it in this woman.
And I did not attribute that except to the fact that the woman was a Bedouin, her body rough and exposed, with visible veins, so it became apparent to the senses that this moving humors and it was necessary that it would not appear in the same way among the people of refinement and those with smooth bodies and hidden veins.
So if you want to treat it and the patient feels the pain, then as I described, it will appear before your eyes. Bind him above and below with a bandage and cut into him until that congested humors is released and the place is cleared.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it by rubbing the body and what drives away the wind and stirs it up like a mustard plaster and a poultice and similar remedies.
The Ninetieth Chapter.
In Extracting Arrows.
The arrows may differ according to their kinds and the parts of the body where they strike, as well as their differences in kind. Some are large and small, some are glass-coated and smooth, some have three angles and four angles.
And some have fragments, and as for those that occur according to the organs where they strike, then there are two kinds: either the organs are main organs coated with a membrane like the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestine, bladder, and similar ones. So when an arrow strikes one of these organs and symptoms of death appear as I have described to you, then it is necessary to avoid extracting that arrow from there, for death will befall its owner in most cases. And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not lodged in the depths of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And as for the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the peritoneum on the brain, then it will be exposed to severe headache, fever, and dizziness.
And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not lodged in the depths of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And as for the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the peritoneum on the brain, then it will be exposed to severe headache, fever, and dizziness. And redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, trembling, and confusion of mind, followed by a fit or convulsion. Sometimes blood may flow from the nostrils or ears, sometimes speech may be lost and the voice gone, and liquid may issue from the wound like white matter resembling flesh.
So if these signs appear to you, stop treating the patient and do not extract the arrow if it has not already been removed. As for the symptoms of the arrow, if it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast and you feel as though it has lodged in something hard rather than something hollow.
As it may happen that the arrow moves like a pulse and flows from the wound black blood, and subsequently the limbs become chilled and cold and pale; therefore know that death is imminent and unavoidable. The sign of the arrow if it has pierced the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels near the neck swell, and the patient's complexion changes, and he breathes rapidly high up and asks for cold air; if the arrow has reached the diaphragm that is in the chest then it will be near the small ribs and there will be great breathing with severe pain.
And the patient becomes rigid and all the limbs on both sides are affected, if the arrow has reached the liver then it will be followed by severe pain and black blood similar to the liver in its color will come out of the wound; if the arrow has reached the intestines perhaps something that is not digested will come out of the wound.
The case is clear, if the arrow has reached the abdomen and is stuck there and something from feces or urine or excrement comes out of the wound or intestine which has burst then there is no hope for its treatment nor for removing the arrow; if the arrow has reached the bladder and urine has come out.
And something comes out from it to the outside and the pain intensifies on the patient, so know that he is dead; as for other organs such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, back, shin and similar organs they have submitted to the greatest decree.
If the arrow did not hit a major blood vessel or bone and the arrow was not poisoned, I will tell you some of what I have seen happen with these arrows so that you can infer from it how to treat yours; this is because an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
So I extracted it from him on the other side under the earlobe and he recovered without any harm to his eye, and I extracted another arrow that had struck a Jew who had been hit in the corner of his eye beneath the lower eyelid and the arrow was embedded and only the small end that is attached to the shaft remained.
And it was a large arrow from the composite arrows of Qasim, made of polished iron, without fins, and there was no harm in the eye of the Jew, nor any evil event occurred to him. And another arrow was taken out from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arab arrow.
And it was the one that had fins, and I split him between the two ribs, for he had fallen into his throat and I probed with it until I took it out and the Christian recovered. And another arrow was taken out from a man who had been struck in his belly, and we counted that he would have died from it.
So when thirty days or so had passed and nothing changed with him, I split the arrow and probed it on him and took it out and he recovered. And no evil event occurred to him. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, so the wound became festering on him.
So when seven years had passed, the arrow came out at its root. And I saw a woman struck by an arrow in her belly, and the wound became festering and the arrow remained, and nothing changed with her nor was she finding any harm from anything of her natural actions.
And I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound became festering and remained without him feeling much pain. And there are many like this. And I took out an arrow from a man of the Sultan's guard who had been struck in the middle of his nose, which was slightly leaning to the right side.
And the arrow was removed completely, and I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. And I found the wound of the arrow very narrow, so I probed it with a fine probe, but I did not find anything, and he was finding numbness and pain under his right earlobe.
And I suspected that numbness was from the side of the arrow, so I applied a poultice to the place with a strong adhesive and had hope that the place would swell up and show an indication of the arrow's presence. Then I probed him again, but nothing happened in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
I treated the patient with a poultice over many days, but no accident occurred. I then closed the wound and left him for a long time until he felt a pain one day in his nose inside. He told me about it and I applied the sharp, acute medicine to the wound over many days.
Until it opened and I probed it. I then felt the tip of the splinter that was stuck in the wood. Then, I increased the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the splinter appeared to us in plain sight. It continued to come out over a period of time, lasting around four months.
Then, when the wound had expanded and I was able to insert probes into it, I grasped it and manipulated it. It did not respond to being pulled out, so I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until one day I managed to extract it using firm probes as you will see in the final part of this book.
And the physicians were saying that his nasal cartilage would not heal. I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely without any harm whatsoever. And I am telling you how to extract some splinters so that this can serve as a measure and proof of what I have not mentioned.
Because the details of this craft and its intricacies cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed in a book, but rather the skilled craftsman measures the little by the much and draws upon what is present to infer what is absent, and derives new action and new tool from unusual circumstances.
If I were to descend from this craft, I would say that splinters exit from the organs in which they are embedded into two types: either by being drawn out from the place where they entered or by emerging from the opposite side of the original entry point.
If the arrow is prominent in a place of fat, it attracts and comes out; if it does not come out at its time when it fell there, you should leave it for some days until the fat that surrounds it becomes soft and makes it easier to attract and bring it out, and similarly if it enters bone.
And if it does not come out, leave it also for some days and repeat the attraction and stirring every day until it comes out. If it still does not come out after some days, you should drill around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a thin awl until you enlarge the space for the arrow, then attract it and bring it out.
If the arrow has entered the skull and has gone deep into one of the cavities of the brain, and some of those symptoms that I have mentioned to you have appeared from the wound, then stop trying to attract the arrow and leave it until its condition subsides after some days.
Then occupy yourself in attracting the arrow and bringing it out; if it is deeply embedded and does not come out, use the drill around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the place until it heals, and if the arrow has been hidden in some part of the body. And if you are unsure, probe it with a probe; if you find it, attract it with some instruments that are suitable for attracting it; if you cannot do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the arrow being deep in the cavity, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel.
And split it open until the wound widens and you can grasp the arrow until you bring it out; if it has an ear, hold onto it with both ears; free the fatty tissue surrounding it from all sides with any means you can, and be patient; if you cannot free the fatty tissue in breaking the ears and splitting them until you are free.
If you tried to remove the arrow in any position, then use your fingers with forceps towards all directions until it is freed and join with utmost care lest the arrow break and it will be difficult for you to take it out, if you are unable to do so at that time.
Leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putridates then resume, and it will be easier at that time. If bleeding occurs, use what we mentioned earlier in its treatment, and conserve your effort from cutting a vein or nerve or tendon and use cunning.
In every way you can free the arrow and it is by being gentle, slow, and steady as I described to you. And when pulling out the arrow, your hand should be in the same shape it was when the arrow hit him, that's more effective.
If you are unable to do so, use what you can of the shapes. As for the arrow that exits from the opposite side, either it has protruded something outside or else you will find the tip of the arrow by touch on the skin nearby and see it bent.
Then cut into it, and the incision should be as long as the forceps can reach. Then pull it out, for it will be easy to exit. If it is stuck in bone, bend your finger around until the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days and then resume until it comes out. If the shaft is stuck in it, push it gently with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you wanted to use pushing, insert the blunt instrument into its cavity in the end of the arrow then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters into its cavity. The arrow becomes easier to remove by doing so. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary to remove all the flesh that has been affected by the poison if you can do so then treat it according to what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is in the chest or belly or bladder or side and it is near what can be reached with the probe and you are able to incise it, incise and take care not to cut a vein or nerve and remove it.
Then draw the wound if it needs suturing then treat it until it heals, picture of calipers which attract arrows:.
Its ends will be like the bird's tube, as if it were a mold if it is grasped on the arrow or something it did not leave, and different types can be made from them, great and small and medium-sized, all according to the size of the arrow and its wound.
Picture of the caliper.
Picture of the cast caliper.
This is the end of the caliper like a mold to facilitate its entry into the caliper and push it.
The ninety-fifth chapter.
In bleeding of veins.
The veins which are usually bled on the body thirty, of which sixteen in the head, the two jugulars behind the ears known as the Hassasins and the two temporal arteries visible on the temples and the veins that in the orbits of the eyes known as the Nadhirs.
And the vein standing in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugulars that are in the neck, and the veins that are in the upper lip and lower lip of the mouth, and these veins known as the Jihark, and the veins that are under the tongue.
And as for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five, one of which is Qifal, it is from the lateral side and is known to the common people as the vein of the head and shoulder, and the other two are in the middle and are composite of the branch of Pasliq and a branch of Qifal, and are known to the common people as the vein of the body.
The psoas muscle and the subject on the human side, also known as the iliacus, which is called by the common people the belly's vein and the arm's cord. It lies on the thigh and is attached to it and appears above the elbow, clearly visible and relaxed.
And it is the vein that lies between the hamstrings and quadriceps, with two branches: one under the knee joint from the lateral side, and the other saphenous in its place at the ankle from the medial side, and the femoral vein and its place at the popliteal crease from the lateral side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins like it. As for the two veins behind the ears, they are beneficial for stopping chronic fevers, pleurisy, and pneumonia, as well as chronic bad headaches; and how to stop them is as I have described.
And this is that the operator should shave the head of the patient and scrape the back of his head with a rough cloth, well scraped then, until the veins appear in their place behind the ears in the two low places on the head; then grasp them with your finger where you feel their pulse under your finger, and operate.
Then take a thin knife, also known as the "nashl", and insert it under the vein in the skin until it reaches the bone; then lift your hand with the vein and skin up above and cut the vein with the skin in an uninterruptible cut of two thumb's breadth.
Or, if you want to send out the amount of blood that you desire, then tie them off with threads and leave them until they heal. I have mentioned the cutting and stitching in the first book, as for the two arteries on the temples, they are beneficial for stopping chronic pleurisy, difficult headaches, and persistent redness; and sharp hemorrhages directed at the eyes.
How to divide them as I described to you, the wound will be secured with a bandage until the veins become visible to the sense, clearly evident, and their pulsation will become apparent under your index finger. Then, using a scalpel, you lift the skin from the top of the vein to above it with your pointing finger.
And the surgeon inserts the probe from below and lifts the vein up and cuts it like I did in the other veins, and sends out the blood as needed, then frees the constriction of the wound and places their finger on the vein at the moment.
Then, you place a thread and ligature on it and pull from above tightly and firmly, and leave it until it heals. I have already mentioned its cutting and division in the beginning of this book. As for the evacuation of the frontal vein, its benefit comes after evacuating the temporal one to treat chronic facial issues such as eczema, ulcers, and smoldering redness.
And how to divide them as I described to you, the wound will be secured with a bandage until it becomes visible. Then, take the tool called the "fass" and this is its form:.
You place the projecting part at the top of the fass on the same vein and strike it from above with a hammer or something else towards it, and let the blood flow as much as you want. Then, free the constriction of the wound and pull it tight until it heals.
And it may be opened by a broad instrument, except that the instrument should not be sharp-edged like all instruments, but rather broad-edged slightly and divide according to the curvature because the bone is near, so if it is thin, the instrument may break there.
And as for the veins that are in the orbit of the eyes, their benefit is to treat the eye from smallpox, redness, and blepharitis, and other facial diseases. And as for how to divide them, it is by securing the wound with a bandage then dividing them while you are standing on his head and the division should be according to the curvature slightly with a small, broad instrument.
If the wound has no flesh in it, then indeed if the surgeon is thin-handed he may break it. Then blood will flow forth as you need and you put a thread on both of them and tie them for one night then loosen them, and if one were to lance the nasal secretion, it would be beneficial from severe fever.
The severe headache and diseases of the face, such as the red swelling that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic. And how to drain it: by having the patient bend their neck then take hold of their nose with your left hand and take a thin long surgeon.
And insert it in the middle of the nasal passage itself, between holding the nose straight because the secretion does not appear to be felt there then blood appears from its side, and it is necessary that you hold the surgeon's hand a little and let out as much blood as you need then tie it for one night for it quickly becomes better.
And as for boils, draining them is beneficial to relieve constriction of the breath and beginning of leprosy and blackened diseases that appear on the skin's surface such as black spots, eczema, bad ulcers, and swellings. And how to drain them: by having the patient lean down over them in their neck with a strap and the surgeon standing on top of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair then you lance the secretion to the length with a wide incision slightly then let out as much blood as is reasonable or according to what you see as needed then do the same with the other secretion and loosen the strap.
And tie the two secretions with a medium tightening so that the patient does not choke and leave it overnight because the wound will heal. And as for the secretions of the groin, draining them is beneficial after draining the nasal passages because it benefits from abscesses in the mouth and corruption of the gum and bad ulcers and splits of the lips and bad ulcers.
The one that is in the nose and around it, and how to uncover them so that the patient stands before you with their head wrapped with a turban then turns their lips and looks at the two moles that you see one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side of it and determine by their colors.
And similarly, the veins around them are black and thin, so cut them off in pieces. If it is difficult for you to know what they are, then aim at the larger one and divide it, and do the same with the moles that are on the lower lip.
And as for the moles that are under the tongue, it is beneficial to uncover them after uncovering the uvula for those who suffer from diseases of the throat and mouth, and how to uncover them: the patient sits before you in the sun's shadow, raises their tongue and looks under it on one side a mole and on the other side a mole, and their colors are to blackness.
Then uncover them and be cautious not to cut into them, for under them are tendons, so that blood may flow from those tendons. And as for the three veins that are uncovered in the arm, it is what people have been accustomed to uncovering, and its uncovering will be on two sides.
Either an incision with a wide fig or an olive, to the arm, or else a cut with a thin sickle and this is its form, figure of the broad fig.
It is broad as you see it to open the thick and prominent veins that contain thick and dense blood. And this is its figure, figure of the olive.
And this is the sickle, narrower and thinner, suitable for cutting the thin veins that contain pale and watery blood.
This graft which is suitable for cutting and there are various types of rough and smooth ones according to the size and narrowness of the veins also and it is well-known among craftsmen.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, its benefit lies in that it attracts blood from the defects that occur under the armpits and neck, down to the chest and abdomen. It is necessary for the operator when dividing it to beware of it and be careful not to cut a major artery if he makes a mistake while suturing the wound.
If bleeding occurs, therefore it is necessary that its division not be with a suture needle but rather by cutting with the graft. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then one should avoid it and adjust to another or ask for some of its portion.
Or if it is necessary to cut it in its place, then use the arm strap, as it is clear and cut it with a graft needle as we said. If you want to divide it exactly, then before tightening the arm strap, feel the position until you know the pulse location, then mark it with ink.
Then bind the arm and cut the vein with a diverging incision using a graft needle as we said, and make sure that the blow falls far from the location of the artery. When you tighten the bandage and see swelling in the place where you marked it with ink, then that swelling is the expansion of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood at the incision stop flowing like a baby's milk, and it is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery's blood. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time and then withdraw your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often stops frequently and then bind the arm.
Leave it and warn the patient not to neglect it, and be on guard, without disturbing it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are worried, but a remedy has not presented itself in your time, then ligate the artery if it appears to you, because its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Take a piece of firm, tough leather and cut it in half. Then take one half and apply it firmly to the site of the wound, securing it with bandages and splints until the next day. If bleeding occurs, stop it by doing what was previously mentioned about applying pressure to the bleeding points. Cutting off its flow is not difficult in most cases.
For a small wound and to secure the bandage in the arm, inform it. And if it is a large vein, it is beneficial to prevent it from drawing blood from the top of the head and the lower body to where it is composed of two parts: one part from the basilic and one part from the cephalic as we mentioned.
It is necessary for the binder to be on top of it, lest under it there be a tendon; if he increases the number of stitches and hits the tendon, numbness will occur in it that may not recover at all. This tendon often becomes apparent by feeling.
If the wound is subtle in some people and thin, so that it does not become apparent, then you should make your bandage a cut one with a needle, and avoid the tendon as much as possible. If the vein is between two tendons, cut the vein lengthwise. And if it is the cephalic vein, it is beneficial to prevent it from drawing blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases and it is necessary in this vein specifically if you want to prevent it; to prevent it with two stitches by the olive oil needle or the broad lemongrass needle because it is safer for all the veins since there is no artery or nerve underneath.
Unless that which you should avoid when binding is only the head of the muscle, and ask for a calm place; it does not harm him if he is not hit in the first blow, but rather be bound again several times except that perhaps it will swell in some people if it is not bound in the first blow.
However, that tumor will not harm him, and as for the manner of incision and its complications, and what should be done to repair it, first it is necessary to know that an incision is either used solely to preserve health.
And either it is used in diseases, and what is used to preserve health and its continuation, and prevention of the occurrence of diseases, then an incision should be in one of the three veins in the arm, namely the cephalic, basilic, or median cubital vein, and the incision should be in the beginning of spring if signs of fullness appear.
And the incision should be on Sunday or Tuesday, three hours after sunrise, and as for the incision that is used in diseases, it has no limited time but whenever necessity and urgency call for it, whether by day or night.
And in every hour and at every time, it is not necessary to cut off the young until they are fourteen years old, nor those who have exceeded sixty years of age. If someone decides on an incision for any reason.
It is necessary to purify the area with a gentle injection if there is much congealed blood present, lest it be attracted to the veins during the incision and cause excessive bleeding that may harm the major organs. And one should not make an incision on someone who is intoxicated or drunk until that state has passed from them.
And one should also beware of the incision after a heavy meal, vomiting, or excessive sexual intercourse, and overexertion, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and all that which weakens the bodily or spiritual power. Then look at liquefying the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
By means of food, drink, and medicine if possible, then enter the bath if something does not prevent it or engage in some physical activity so that blood may flow and make his incision at mid-day as we said, and strive to leave his chest free from all bad psychic influences.
Pains, anger, fear, and all bodily afflictions such as exhaustion, excessive standing, sexual activity, and similar things, and prepare the instruments needed for the tasks people are accustomed to using from various fragrances, winds, and music, each person according to what they can do.
Then the surgeon sits on a pillow that is higher than the one he sits on, then he extends his arm and massages the patient with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the bandage together with the assistant, doing it two or three times, gently.
Because the tightening should be moderate, either excessive tightening would prevent blood flow or too little tightening would also prevent it; then after tightening, the assistant should massage his hands all together with a bunch.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch, then the surgeon should gently clean the area around the incision with a small amount of old oil, especially; then he should place his ring finger on the left hand on the same vein under the site where he wants to make the incision slightly so that the vein does not escape from being struck. Because there are veins that flee from the incision like a thread, and some are filled with air; when the surgeon places his finger on them, they go down under the incision and deceive him, so that the incision does not open up the vein, and if it opens, then it only opens slightly.
So the surgeon should be careful and cautious in all these matters, then he should go down on his finger; if the vein opens up at that spot, then otherwise he should repeat it again once more under or above that spot with a gentle pressure if the area does not become inflamed.
If the wound becomes inflamed or swells, he should leave it for a day or two and not tighten the bandage; perhaps he may bring forth a warm boil and will not enter the bath, then he can repeat the incision if desired; if the puncture was small and the bleeding was slight.
Be careful not to let the blood flow more than you want. Have the operator in the same opening, align it with the straightness and open it a little more. Do that with the drill before the place becomes inflamed. Many people's places become inflamed when opened slightly.
If you see it becoming inflamed, do not touch it at all, because it will not benefit you. Instead, put something from oil on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this place than oil itself or other unguents, likewise.
Use the oil's residue in all your bloodletting of veins when there is difficulty in letting out the blood. And sometimes, the theriac of Farouk and the Shakhzaniya can be used if one of them is applied to the place, for the blood will flow and become thin if it is thick.
If a lump occurs in the place of bloodletting and it is large, this often happens especially to those who have not bled except that one time or if the vein has been opened slightly. Then hurry, place a damp sponge soaked in hot water and salt on the lump, squeeze it for an hour, and it will dissolve.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself, either completely or from another vein. If something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, that does not harm. If you wish, then apply something of vinegar and honey mixed together.
Or something of vetch's juice and the like. And many times a lump and swelling occur when bloodletting is done from the saphenous veins. Place your hand on it, if you find it tender when you press on it, then that is a bad swelling, so beware not to apply anything we mentioned earlier.
For it is possible that blood may flow from the artery, but stop it with what is necessary to constrict it and make the place firm. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. And it is necessary to let out of each person as much blood as his strength allows, according to the prevailing color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it be drained until it turns red. Similarly, if it is thick, let it be drained until it thins out. Similarly, if it is sharp, let it be drained until its sharpness subsides. And it is necessary for one who is full and needs to drain blood to do so all at once.
That he should dilate the vein and be broad, and whoever is weak is opposite to that. It is necessary for him to remove it gradually and the puncture to be narrow. And the best thing to use in draining the pus is one that opens up a gap without being pierced.
And this type of incision is free from bleeding and cutting nerves, and it is the best and most safe method of drainage. And whoever is accustomed to using deceit when draining should be given something to eat beforehand, such as bread soaked in almond or rosewater milk.
If he is tranquil and the blood is drained from him in three or four times, then if his temperament is relaxed, let him take bread soaked in rosewater or honey mixed with wine before the incision.
If deceit occurs during the incision and it is due to excessive blood flow, then let him be given water of meat and refined rosewater drink. He should use expensive perfume and anoint his chest with it, and use everything we mentioned in the chapter on deceit.
Whoever needs to empty his arm and release his blood again. And if someone's incision is for purging and his strength is weak, let him release the blood little by little as much as possible in consecutive days.
And if someone wants to relax his arm and release his blood again, and his body is strong, let him do so after the first incision on the seventh or ninth hour. And if he wants to draw the blood from his body towards the opposite side it has bent towards, then let him do so on the second or third day.
And as for one who has excess blood in his body, it has boiled and become hot and caused fever, then it is necessary to let out the blood all at once and to remove a great deal of it, and to widen the opening until the membrane is exposed after all the conditions of venesection have been fulfilled. And place your hand on his pulse while letting out the blood so that death does not occur instead of the membrane; for it often happens like that if the one venesectioning is unaware and neglectful. And do not intend to release the arm again and let out more blood.
And if the armpit has closed up and it is difficult to let out the blood, then strike him forcefully or twist with great strength; for that is very beneficial. Either leave it until it opens up again, or use a lancet to cut open what has clotted in the armpit.
Or put something of salt, which is dissolved in water, or some Farouq's powder or Shikhzaniya on him and press it gently until the blood comes out. If the armpit has swollen, leave it as it is.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity requires letting out blood again, then either open it above that spot or open another arm or armpit.
And as for bleeding the arm vein, it is replaced by letting out blood from the lacrimal gland and palatine vein if they are not found or are hidden because it is composed of them. And the manner of doing so is that the one performing venesection should put his hand in hot water until the cord becomes red and the armpit becomes clearly visible, then tie it above with a bandage somewhat tightly but moderately.
Then make the incision on the armpit slightly obliquely, neither too wide nor too long. And let the opening be wide and make your incision above the wrist joint slightly, if the blood does not come out, then put the arm back in the hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you reach your need, if you are in the summer days, you can dispense with washing the hand in hot water and even more so that it makes blood flow in hot water during winter, and this sweating is safer from all veins. Because there is no vein or nerve underneath, and as for the phlebotomy of the right hand, it is beneficial for the liver's ailments; how to do it: grasp the wrist of the hand with a bandage or your own hand after putting it in hot water until the sweat swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve underneath, and as for the phlebotomy of the right hand, it is beneficial for the liver's ailments; how to do it: grasp the wrist of the hand with a bandage or your own hand after putting it in hot water until the sweat swells. It becomes clear to the patient quickly, then you release it slightly and if you cut off all of it, that will not harm him; be careful not to insert your hand into the incision because underneath is a nerve of the fingers and the place is exempt from flesh, then you return the hand to hot water.
And let the blood flow in it because if you do not put it in hot water, the blood will congeal in the vein and refuse to flow; when you remove as much of the needed blood as possible, apply oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
And likewise, you should do this for every narrow vein; and as for the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments, and likewise do this in phlebotomy as you did in the second one, whether right or left; and as for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefits are for diseases below the body such as uterus ailments.
And persistent hemorrhoids and kidney ailments, and ulcers of the thighs and legs, chronic diseases and others; how to do it: his leg enters hot water and a poultice is placed on it until the veins swell, then grasp above the ankle joint with the company and the vein's position at the heel, outward towards the instep.
Many veins branch off from the man's face, so one should ligate the largest vein of them or at the ankle when it is gathered together; this is better and safer. If one has ligated it on the man's face, then he must take care not to damage the nerves that lie beneath the skin of the man's face.
Make the ligature by twisting as if you were to cut him off and let the surgeon be steady, if the bleeding does not cease, then make his foot wet with hot water and leave the blood to flow in it until it is exhausted, if the one ligating makes a mistake in the ligature on the first attempt.
Make the ligature above a little bit, for the place is safe and does not fear harm if you take care of the nerve as we said, and do the same with the saphenous vein on the other side of the man's leg, whether it be this or that. And as for the femoral vein, its place is as we said, at the groin on the wild side.
And the benefit of ligating it for a hip injury if that is due to hot blood, and how to ligate it: the patient should enter the bath and hurry and grasp his leg from the hip up to the ankle with four fingers wrapped in a thin long cloth; then it will only be apparent by doing so.
If it appears, then ligate it in whatever condition you find him, either by twisting or cutting off a piece or splitting it open; his place is safe, and this is so for most people; if you do not find it.
And if it does not appear at all, then ligate some of its branches, which are the ones that show on the back of the foot towards the heel and ankle, take care of the nerves and send out as much blood as you want.
Then remove the ligature and put a bandage on the site of the ligature, and tighten the place; for it will soon heal.
The Sixth Ninetieth Chapter.
In Hemostasis and the Method of Its Use.
The lancets may be of bronze, wood, iron and glass; the hemostasis is twofold: one type being with a constriction and the extraction of blood, and the other without a constriction.
And this hemostasis which is without a constriction is two-faced.
The lancets of the armpits, which are on both sides of the neck from all directions, and the lancets of the jugular vein, which is under the lower jawbone of the mouth, and the lancets of the shoulders, and the lancets of the hamstrings at the back of the thigh, and the lancets of the forearms, and the lancets of the shins.
The hemostasis is what draws the blood from the visible arteries that are embedded in the flesh; and for this reason, the strength does not fall like a phlebotomy nor should the hemostasis be used with fire or without fire in any of the diseases that are due to congestion until the body has been relieved.
If necessity demands hemostasis due to a disease or as a habit, we have used it at all times in the first, middle and last of the month and at any time.
And that is because some people, when blood accumulates in them to the extent that they need to be bled with hemostasis, find heaviness and headache in their head; and some of them find congestion and redness on their face, head, and neck; and some of them find itching and pimples on their face and navel, and darkness and drowsiness in their eyes; and some of them have numbness at the place of their hemostasis.
Some of them laugh a lot, and some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth, and their gums tremble and they spit out blood. Some of them sleep a lot, and some of them see in their sleep blood, redness, and cuts, and what is similar to that, so whenever we see something like that.
And particularly if it occurs in the middle of the month, we are ordered to perform cupping after two or three hours have passed from midday. As for the benefit of cupping on the neck, it benefits the weighty head and brings water to the eyes.
But it is necessary that this be done after the entire body has been purged and this cupping can serve as a substitute for purging bile. One should beware of using it if someone has cold-headed blood or has an attack, because it will harm them greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold-headed illnesses should not use it, nor should someone who is addicted to it because it will cause forgetfulness in them.
Therefore, the cupper should be ordered to lower his hand slightly towards the bottom of the vein in fear of causing forgetfulness, and as for cupping on the calf, it is a substitute for purging the black bile and purging the pleura.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma and shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, spitting up phlegm, and fullness. And one should lift the cupping on the calf slightly because if it is directed towards the bottom, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
And as for cupping on the ears, it benefits from headaches occurring in the head and face, neck, and throat, and toothache. It is a substitute for purging the pleura, and one should order the cupper not to deepen his hand in the fold so that he does not cut any veins and cause bleeding.
What concerns bloodletting under the tongue is effective for removing tumors in the mouth and decay of the gums, and similar diseases that occur in the mouth. It can also take the place of cupping on the cheeks. As for bloodletting on the shoulders, it is beneficial for hyperventilation caused by overeating and heat.
And as for bloodletting on the lower abdomen, it is beneficial from what benefits cupping on the three prominent veins, namely the basilic, cephalic, and saphenous, because it draws blood from all those hidden veins in the flesh and draws those hidden veins from thicker ones until it reaches the three thick veins.
It is necessary for the bloodletter not to pierce deeply in the area, because it is exposed flesh with nerves and veins underneath. As for a single cupping on the anus, it is beneficial for haemorrhoids and wounds in the lower part.
It is necessary for the bloodletter to make the cup large and from copper, because the area needs a strong suction and perhaps the glass cup will break and cause many punctures. As for cupping on the legs, it reduces swelling in a clear manner.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder, and relieves menstruation and is beneficial for boils and carbuncles, and takes the place of cupping on the sides and ankles except that it exhausts the body greatly and causes dizziness in most people. Cupping on the ankles is almost as beneficial as bloodletting on the legs.
The manner of placing the cups is that you first place an empty cup and then apply a moderate suction without prolonging its placement, but rather quickly applying and removing it in order to allow the pus to come forth evenly and not yet stopping until you see the area has turned red and opened.
Blood appeared, so then he tightens and redoes the bandage gradually, then looks at the state of the bodies, so if someone from among the people has soft flesh and is porous in pores, it is necessary that he tightens only one bandage, lest the place becomes disarranged.
The barber is ordered to widen the bandage and deepen it slightly, and to adjust the cloth gently and softly. If there is thick blood, he should bind twice: in the first instance, he should open a path for the flow of blood and its moisture; and in the second instance, he should strive to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is extremely bitter, he should rebind once more to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a little blood, one bandage suffices; but if we want to remove much blood, we bind with multiple bandages, and if it is thick blood.
It is necessary to bind a deep bandage and the moderate depth in the bandage only reaches the skin, as for what should be used from ointments when dressing wounds and water, and what the patient should avoid. However, if his skin is hard, rigid, and coarse, with narrow pores.
It is necessary to anoint the places of wounds with open, mild, and resolving ointments. However, if it is in the time of summer, then like anointing with sweet almond oil or violet oil or honeyed walnut oil or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in the winter, then like anointing with lavender oil or valerian oil or balm or hyacinth and so on. However, if the flesh is thick and cold, then let the ointment be mustard oil or camphor oil or panax oil or sassafras and so on.
If the patient has open pores and looseness of the flesh, it is necessary that he abstain from ointment. And these ones should wash their wounds after bloodletting with rose water or cold water or mulberry juice or pumpkin seed juice or grape juice and so on. And if his blood is very moist.
Washes his legs with kohl or water of the asab, samgh, and similar substances. If his swelling is severe, he washes his legs with old wine or water of murkhoosh, tharija, or bapungh, and it is necessary to beware of bloodletting in the bathhouse and after the bathhouse.
It is necessary that it be used after leaving the bathhouse for an hour or two, and it is not allowed for anyone to sleep after bloodletting. What is necessary is that the patient and the one who is having the bloodletting prepare themselves before the bloodletting and afterwards.
It is necessary to look first; if the patient or the one having bloodletting has a sanguine temperament and his blood is sharp and inflamed, then it is necessary for him to take cooling substances such as pomegranate, henbane with kohl, thyme, and scents like jasmine, and to make his food fatty foods, tender goat meat, and sweetmeats, and the like.
And if he has a cold temperament, it is necessary for him to drink honey wine and date juice or sweet scented skunk's horn, and to consume moderate perfumed wine that is between the old and the new. He should be ordered to eat little food and make his food fatty foods, green stalks, and white pigeon food, and it is necessary for the drink on the day of bloodletting and cupping to be more than the food.
And it is necessary for some people in certain times to drink the antitoxin, musk medicine, or Shilta before bloodletting and cupping, or after it, in order to strengthen the main organs and purify the blood, and it is not allowed for the abstainers.
And as for the bloodlettings that are unconditional, they are the ones that are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, belly, and back of the thigh because these organs do not tolerate it. Rather, its purpose is to attract the blood from one organ to another.
We place the compress on the breasts in case of a cough or we use it to remove cold air from the part. If it is placed on the abdomen and loins, then it relaxes the part, warms it up, and removes the pain by dispersing it.
And it is placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone, so that its power may be used to draw out the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place. Similarly, it does this if placed on the liver and spleen when there is a chill in them. This compress can also be used empty with vinegar only.
And it is used with fire and also filled with lukewarm water in the case of swelling. This compress is filled with hot water alone or with water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for that purpose.
Then it is placed filled on the location, held, removed, and repeated as needed. And this is an image of the compress that is used with fire:.
Its mouth is two fingers open as we have depicted, and its depth is half a finger's width. On the side of it, about half of that distance away, there is a small hole just large enough for a needle made from Chinese copper or yellow copper with thickened edges.
Smooth and flat, so that it does not hurt the part when placed on it. And in its center there is a recessed space made of copper or iron where the candle with fire is placed. This compress can be made larger or smaller according to the diseases.
The manner of using this compress with fire on the part is that you take a wick from a tightly rolled cloth or a small candle and place it in the middle of the compress, which has been prepared as described.
The flames will ascend upwards towards the lower part of the wound so that the patient's body is not burned. Then, the dressing will be placed on the member and the finger will be placed on the hole we mentioned until we secure the dressing as needed, remove the finger.
The steam emerged from that hole and the dressing dissolved at its place. Then, the thread was pulled on the skin and returned to its original state if it was needed again. As for the dressing used in treating scrofula with water, there is no inserted rod or hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the member only, and this is its form:.
And this dressing, whenever it was large enough to hold a lot of water, was better.
The 97th Chapter.
In the treatment of dropsy.
The dropsy is used most of the time in the organs that cannot be wrapped with a dressing, either because they are small like the lip and palate and similar ones, or because the organ is exposed from flesh, like the finger and nose and similar ones.
And as for the manner of its use, take the dropsy that is in pure fresh water from the sources, then leave it a day and night in the fresh water until it is drained and there is nothing left inside. Then the body will be purged first by vomiting or bleeding, then the affected member will be cleaned.
Until it turns red, then a dressing will be placed on it. If the swelling subsides, it fell; and if possible, bandage the place with a dressing, otherwise wash the area with vinegar, then with much water, massage, and squeeze; and if bleeding continues after the dropsy has subsided, take a linen cloth wet in cold water.
And place it above until the hemorrhaging ceases; if the bleeding is heavy, sprinkle powdered alum or sycamore on it, or something similar from the astringent substances, until the bleeding stops or apply half a cup of bounded agaric to the area.
Leave it until the ligament sticks in place, then the blood stops, and what is needed is to reattach the ligament. Do not attach that ligament if another can be found. If the ligament refuses to stick, clean the site with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the site until something emerges from the blood, then put it down. If it feels something of the blood, it will stick to the place. And if you want it to come off, sprinkle some salt or sand on it, and it will fall onto the place.
The Third Chapter.
In Setting [or Bandaging].
This chapter also contains what is needed in the art of medicine, namely setting fractures and treating broken bones that occur in the bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter may be claimed by ignorant physicians and common people who have not consulted a book on the subject nor read a single line of it.
And because of this reason, this art of medicine has been non-existent in our country, and I have never seen a single good one in it. And I have only gained from it what I have gained through the length of my reading of the books of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them until I extracted the science from them, then I devoted myself to experimentation and apprenticeship throughout my life.
And I have described for you everything that is contained in my knowledge in this chapter. And I have applied my experience to it after having presented it to you and simplified it from the excessive length, shortened it as much as possible, clarified it as much as clarification can be, and illustrated for you in it many forms of the devices that are used in it.
As is the case with excessive explanation, as I have done in the preceding chapters, and there is no strength except by Allah the Exalted, the Great.
The First Chapter.
In this chapter and sections of what pertains to the breaking of bones, it is necessary to present them and before we start mentioning each broken or disjointed limb separately, it is necessary to mention here at the beginning of this book general principles and chapters. You are compelled first to understand it and stand on the truth of it, for you alone among those who are eager to learn this noble craft are not you.
I say that whenever one of the bones is broken or dislocated or splintered or falls, it is necessary to hasten first to treat it or reduce it or all together. Unless prevented by an obstacle such as weakness of power or what has happened to him being a child or elderly, or the time being extremely hot or extremely cold indeed.
Then he should limit his food to cold legumes and bird meat and fish, and abstain from drinking and fatty meats and indulging in food, and every food that fills the veins with blood until if the swelling subsides and does not expect an accumulation of matter to the place.
Then the patient should return to his initial routine, and if the broken bone is in need of setting, it is necessary for the patient to eat nourishing foods that are abundant, thick, and tender, such as barley, rice, heads, and mutton, and cow's hooves. And eggs, cooked fish, and thick drink, and the like. For by this regimen, the setting of the fracture is faster and better, and know that broken bones in old men and elderly people cannot reunite and heal to their natural state at all.
The bones of the elderly are stiff and brittle, and may reunite and heal in some cases, just as the bones of young children do. But nature forms on the broken bone from all sides something like a kind of gruel that thickens and adheres to it until some parts stick together with others.
Some of them bind together until they reach the utmost strength and security as they were at first, so that nothing hinders their actions.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide the patient with nourishment that contains strength, moisture, and thickness as we said. And know that fractures differ in kind according to the difference in organs, for a fracture of the tibia is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the back.
And so are all the other organs, each one different from the others. And we will mention each type of fracture separately in its own chapter, and the type of bone fracture may also differ within itself.
Because it may be a compression fracture without splinters, or it may be a longitudinal fracture with splinters and loose fragments, some of which are free and others not. And the fracture may occur with a wound and tear in the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
And each type has its own special trick in setting it, as will be mentioned separately in its place. And what is known about a bone fracture is its deformation and deviation from the normal position, and its appearance to the sense of touch and sensation when you touch it with your hand.
So when there is no apparent deformation, no sensation or feeling when you touch the bone with your hand, and the patient does not experience much pain, it is not a fracture, but rather a bruise, a slight crack or a minor break, and it should not be manipulated at all.
But rather, apply to it the medicines that will be mentioned later when it suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if a bone is crushed and separated into two pieces without splinters, except that each piece has become detached from its owner.
You should begin by adjusting and straightening it before a hot abscess occurs to it, if a hot abscess occurs to it then leave it for some days until the hot abscess subsides, then smooth it as you are able with gentle touch and skill.
Know that setting and straightening it is easier than the bone in which fragments have occurred, then tie up what will be mentioned later. If the bone has fragments, then you must lengthen the broken limb on both sides by hand or foot.
Either by your hand if the limb is small, or by two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let your setting be such that you place the limb in its natural position until the broken bone extends, then return those fragments to their places as you are able with skill and gentle touch.
And strive to avoid causing pain or distress to the patient through your action. Strive to bring together one of the bones with its fellow in the best possible position, and at that time touch and feel them with your hand. If you see something contrary to nature, correct it as far as your ability permits.
And beware of excessive stretching and strong pressure, as many practitioners do, and often cause a hot abscess or inflammation in the limb, as I have observed them doing repeatedly.
Then bind the limb after setting, precision and stretching, so that it remains at rest and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it during his wakefulness, sleep, or when changing position, or during his urination and all his movements, until it is completely healed.
And that is because whenever the patient feels pain or discomfort in his usual position, he should transfer him to another position where he does not feel pain, and strive for that position to be straight and steady.
If the member is not splinted, then it will become distorted. As for the manner of splinting a broken member, I will describe it to you as I see fit. Know that broken members differ in their smallness and largeness and thickness, so what is smaller among them like the arm and finger and shin and similar parts.
It is necessary for the bandages of the splint to be soft and gentle, whereas what is rougher among them like the thigh and back and chest should be firm and rigid because the wide bandage is required for the large member and tightens it from all sides with equal pressure without any defect.
Then you start by applying the dressing corresponding to that. On the swollen part of the break then start wrapping the bandage on the same spot three or four turns according to what the member deserves, and hold tight with your hand on the bandage, then go up to the upper part of the break.
By holding it slightly less tightly than the break, then you move away from the break a little with the wrapping and loosen the hold a little bit until you take something from the correct position, then take another binding and wrap it also on the broken place.
Wraps, then go down with the wrapping to the lower part of the break. And be your action in tightening and loosening the wrap as we mentioned in the first upper wrap, then put between the wraps some swelling or bruise that matches the distortion of the break.
If there is distortion, then do not leave anything in it; then wrap another binding on top of it and smooth out these tight folds with your hand if there is no puffing or heat swelling in the member.
If there is puffing or heat swelling, then apply to it what calms that swelling and goes away with the puffing and leave it for a few days; then wrap tight on it when that time has passed. The wraps should be from coarse papyrus strips cut straight or should be wraps from willow wood splints.
That which is made from cypress wood or palm fronds or juniper or sycamore and similar things that are available, and let the size of each splint be as described in this shape exactly.
Except that the splint put on the fracture itself should be thicker and a little wider than the other splints, as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is suitable for the broken member, large or small.
Then it is bound with another bandage to the splints, according to your first tightening exactly, and then it is secured from above with the tightened threads as we mentioned, that being that your tightening should be more on the site of the fracture. And every time you are away from the fracture, the tightening should be less.
And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and firmness, and they should be made of wet cotton in particular, for if the threads are thick like what I have seen some ignorant people do, using unfolded cotton strips, which is a very great mistake.
Because the tightening with it goes beyond moderation, and the firm threads are also not suitable because you do not achieve what you want to tighten, and it is not right that there should be less than a finger's width between the splint and the other splints.
If the patient complains of the edges of the splints after being tightened in the correct places, then place under them a layer of flax or untangled wool until it no longer causes him any discomfort. And if the fracture is accompanied by an injury and there has been a tear in the skin, we will deal with that separately.
And know that not every broken bone should be tightened with splints from the first day, for if the member is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it except after five or seven or more days according to your judgment about the risk of developing inflammation.
This is the description of the dressings that the ancients used to apply to fractures, dislocations, and sprains. This is a general and simple dressing that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women because it does not cause heat or cold.
And it is that one takes from the dust of the millstone, which clings to its edges when the grinder is in motion. He kneads it as it is, without mixing it with egg white, and makes it neither thick nor thin, then uses it.
The description of the dressing that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is taken from ten drams each of opium, vetch, henbane, hellebore, and poppy, and five drams each of mercuric salt, myrrh, and Armenian or Roman clay. All of these are pounded and mixed with myrrh water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then this dressing is used; it is a good composition that sets broken bones quickly and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.
The description of another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and sprains. It is taken from ten drams each of myrrh, opium, white henbane, mercuric salt five drams, vetch six drams, Armenian clay twenty drams. All of these are pounded finely and mixed with water or egg white and used.
The description of a dressing for dislocated joints and bones that have gone out of their places, to alleviate the pain that accompanies them, and to calm the shock caused by the fracture. It is taken from old wool that is soaked in vinegar and cooked oil, and placed on the spot; this dressing does not have the power to set bones.
But it is excellent in cooling the inflamed swelling and driving away pains, in particular. The description of another dressing that sets broken bones: one takes the bark of the persimmon tree and the prickly leaf, pounds all together, and applies them moistly. The description of another simple dressing used when a bone is freshly broken.
And you want to analyze the remainder of the tumor, take from each one a small part of the onion, celandine, and gentian root, all together, and mix them with indigo if the member is not inflamed; but if it is inflamed, mix them with water or vinegar and use it.
Formula for a poultice stronger than the first one, used when a hard tumor occurs in the bone, takes from the origin of onion, tamarind, and sage, as well as mallow, crown flower, and rue, each one part.
Mix all of them together and mix with vinegar or sweet water or indigo, all that according to the warmth of the member and its quiescence; but as for Galen, he did not mention in his book putting it on a broken bone when setting it.
Except for the binding agent made from beeswax and oil, without anything else; and Galen described it to be of medium consistency between thickness and softness. As for Galen, he thought that on setting a broken bone, one should use things containing gelatinous substance with something warm like myrrh, saffron, and resin, and so forth as mentioned.
Formula for a poultice that is beneficial for weakness and pain, takes from the following: safflower, gallnut, human hair or bird down, onion, and salt. All of these are crushed and sifted together and mixed with water, then applied as needed; and as for how long the bandage should be left on.
Then dissolve it, but only if you have observed that the pain and swelling have subsided, the bone has not shifted from its place, and there is no inflammation; otherwise, do not dissolve it for many days, lest severe inflammation or anxiety occurs.
Then dissolve it at the right time and do not delay; and remove the poultice from it. Then take a clean linen cloth or sponge, damp but not wet, and immerse it in warm water, and wash the area until the inflammation subsides and the pain subsides, then leave the member to rest for a moment.
Then wrap him with the polluted wool, soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, and tie it on him until the warm tumor subsides and the member's inflammation goes away and its pain departs. Then return him to gentle compression and slight binding, but do not bind him as tightly as your first binding.
And nurse him until he recovers, if you see that the tumor, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have gone away and you relied on compression and binding, then treat him as you did at first, whether or not anything happens to the member mentioned.
Do not remove the wrapping except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days, each according to what appears to you from the condition of the member as we said, until if the fracture becomes necessary and the flesh begins to form over it.
Also add at that time to the binding more than your first binding, and also increase the thickening of the patient's food as mentioned earlier. If you see that the site of the fracture has dried up and is not receiving what it should receive, know that the nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
If you see that the patient has been wrapped in cold water at every wrapping, and this is done every three days, and reduce the binding slightly, for by doing so, nourishment reaches the member quickly and it recovers soon. As for what the foolish ones do to those who have broken their members once more.
For if it does not heal as it should and heals with a twist, that is the mistake of their actions and a great calamity, even though it may be correct as mentioned in their early books and practiced by them, and I have seen no one among them having any effect in that. And the truth is, do not practice it.
The Second Section.
On the fractures in the head.
Types of fractures in the head are many and varied, and their causes are diverse. Some fractures may occur due to a sword blow, and they can either split the bone entirely until it reaches the membrane that is beneath the bone. Like splitting wood.
And therefore, this type of fracture is called a "qudumi" and sometimes the sword may cut some of the bone and split its surface only without penetrating to the end, which is called a "complete excision". And the wound of these two fractures can be either great or small.
And there are fractures that are flaky or cracked and their cause is a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone, or something similar. This fracture can be either superficially reaching the membrane beneath the bone or it can be on the surface of the bone.
And the wound of these two fractures can also be either great or small. And there are fractures that are hidden in the bone, in the thick hair, which is a slight indentation.
And therefore, this type of fracture is called "sharri", and from it there can be a fracture that occurs due to a fall or a stone being dropped, and the like, which enters into the bone's surface and becomes hollowed out like copper that has been struck and has a part enter inside.
And that is more likely to happen in the moist skull of young men. And there can be fragments, both loose and not loose, among all these types of fractures, and we will discuss their treatment at its place, and we will recognize all these types of fractures by examining them.
And inspecting them with scales and removing the putrid flesh from them. And as for the type of fracture known as "sharri", it is recognized by exposing the bone, wiping and smearing it with a liquid, because the fracture appears black. And as for the treatment of the fracture, one looks first to the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in his symptoms what indicates a clear indication of fear, such as diarrhea, extension, loss of consciousness, cessation of voice, fainting, high fever, change in the eyes and redness, and similar symptoms, do not approach him nor treat him because death is inevitable with these symptoms in most cases.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then take him into treatment, and this is because if the wounded person comes to you at first when he was injured and it was during the winter days.
You should exert yourself in removing the bone before the fourteenth day, under all circumstances, and if it is during summer days, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, so that what is beneath the bone does not decay and expose those symptoms which we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by swelling and inflammation, then you should cut off the deformed part of the injured person's skull as I have described to you, which is that you should shave the head of the wounded person.
And you should expose the bone in whatever way it is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what lies beneath the patient, if an exposure reveals bleeding or warm swelling, then face that with what is necessary.
And this is that you should pack the place with a moistened cloth soaked in wine, rose water and vinegar, then grease the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding ceases, then take up the work of straightening the bone and removing it, which will be done by one of two methods.
One of these two methods is that you should cut the bone with a thin and narrow chisel, and this is its shape:.
Then you should use another chisel after this chisel, which is slightly wider than it, and this is its shape:.
Then you will also use another cutting, wider than the second and it is necessary that you have several cuttings different from each other, some being wider than others and some being shorter than others, and they should be in a great state of sharpness, made of Indian steel or good iron.
And use a hammer in hitting the cutting, lest the head becomes dislocated and injured; if the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to pierce around it before using the cuttings with the chisels which we called non-penetrating chisels.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, in order that the chisel has a rounded corner on what is below its sharp head, resembling a belt or small circle that prevents it from piercing and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to take many of these chisels, each one suitable for the thickness of that bone, until you are prepared for every skull with a chisel for the sharp edge on its length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull, and this is an image of three kinds. From large chisels to medium-sized ones to small ones:.
And as for the way of piercing around a broken bone, it is that you place the chisel on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has given way, then move the chisel to another position and make after each piercing a thickness of about the width of a reed or similar.
Then cut with the cuttings between each piercing and do that with great care as we said, until you loosen the bone either by hand or by something else from one of the instruments I prepared for that.
Like the saw and fine rasps, and it is necessary to beware all care that the chisel or cutting should touch anything from the membrane, for if you loosen the bone and remove it from the membrane, if it was attached to it and extracted, then you must cleanse.
Smoothen what remains of the bone with another tool that resembles a scraper, except that it should be finer and softer than all other scrapers. If there are any small fragments or shavings of bone remaining, take them gently with whatever tools you have.
Then treat the wound with lint and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other side of the work, it is a very easy passage far from pitfalls, as Galen has said and praised greatly, and this is his statement. You should first start by removing a part of the bone from the location where it is more broken and prominent, until you have removed that part and exposed what lies underneath, as shown in this diagram:.
The flat part of it is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is on its sides in a direction parallel to the length as you see. It should stand up against the membrane, and the edge of the scraper is then struck from one side only.
With a small hammer until it cuts all the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane, no frightening incident occurring there, even if the surgeon is inexperienced or busy, or falls asleep.
If there is anything remaining of the membrane attached to some parts of the bone, scrape it away from the bone with the same flat part of the scraper itself and release it gently, for it will release it without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane and what is broken off from the bone remains, with roughness and shavings remaining inside, you should remove that roughness and extract those shavings with a scraper made of different materials in various proportions, so that you can use it wherever needed and tailor it to the requirements of the work.
The broken bone and its shape, and it is necessary that you use in your case the thickest of these ligaments at first, then use afterwards one thinner than it and continue to do so until you reach the finest and most delicate ones.
And as for the other small hairline fractures and slight breaks, it is necessary that you treat each one according to what leads to its healing, which is something not hidden from anyone who has any experience in this craft and stands on what we wrote and demonstrated in large breaks.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, it is necessary that you take a piece of cotton cloth according to the size of the wound, soak it in rose water, and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another piece, triangular or trapezoidal. And soak it in wine and rose water, and place it on the first cloth, and do that with the least amount you can manage so as not to burden the integument, then use it above a broad bandage and don't tighten it except as much as it takes to hold the wound only.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the swelling subsides, then release it and use afterwards the medicines that are with it, such as roots of sown thyme and fine coriander and Khandariq and Zarnaud and similar ones, and do not make them into pills.
And apply it to the wound as it is, and in general, use a medicine that can clean without inflaming, and exert your utmost effort when treating the wound to make it clean, not containing any fat or grime, nor allowing pus to accumulate there at all.
Because pus, if it accumulates on the membrane of the brain, corrupts and spoils it; and an affliction of great severity occurs to the patient because of that, and even more so if the skull is exposed when the bone is uncovered.
Swollen on its surface, look at it; if it is exposed to the manifestations we mentioned earlier, then know that it is doomed, and even if the swelling only occurred due to medication applied to it and was in the power of that medicine to do so.
You should take a part from honey and three parts from rose ointment, then mix them well together and spread the mixture on a cloth, then place it on the abscess and treat it with all the treatment methods necessary until it heals.
The third chapter.
Broken nose.
Know that the nose does not break except its upper part entirely or one of them, because they are two prominent bones; the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but rather becomes deformed, bent, or crushed.
If one of its parts breaks, then you should insert your small finger into the nostril and gently push that fracture from inside with your index and middle fingers from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; do this carefully and check that your action does not cause harm or pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then you should use a stick with a slightly thickened end to set it; if the fracture is on both sides, do the same thing; and begin to apply treatment on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, and if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the swelling has subsided, then insert a thread of linen cloth into the nostril; if the fracture is in one side, use one thread, and if it is on both sides, use two threads.
Let the thread be as thick as it can fill the nostril, and some of the earlier splint makers said that you should grease the thread with fat and change it every day; but I do not see this being necessary, rather let the thread be soaked in white egg mixed with saffron powder.
Then leave the splint until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens, and sometimes in the nose's place where the splint is, put reeds from a goose after wrapping them with linen so that it prevents breaking of the nose lest the patient be unable to breathe.
And this is not a necessary thing if you wish to make it and if you wish to make the splints, for in case of nasal exposure during your work or boil with vinegar or cloth moistened with wine or something from the Deiankhilun ointment.
And if there is no boil, then it is necessary to apply a thin layer of sesame oil and calamus powder that we have mixed with egg whites, then place a linen strip on top without binding the nose in any way; if the bones of the nose are broken into small pieces.
Or if it breaks apart, then you must cut through it and bring it out with the instrument that is suitable for it, then sew the incision and treat it with whatever medication is appropriate for that; and if there is an injury inside the nose, then treat it with a splint and use lead pipes. until it heals.
The Fourth Chapter.
Repair of the lower jawbone if it breaks.
If the lower jawbone breaks and it is not accompanied by an injury, then if it breaks from outside only and does not break in two and crack open to the inside, then knowing it will facilitate treatment.
Then if the break is on the right side, you should insert your left thumb into the patient's mouth and if it is on the left side, you should insert your right thumb and lift up the bone fragment from inside to outside with care.
And your other hand from outside the bone should control it, so if the jawbone has broken into two pieces you should use a retractor on both sides to straighten it until it can be set, and if there is trauma to the teeth.
To separate what has united from it, and to make sure it stays attached with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place the splint on the broken bone, then place a compress on it and put a large secure bandage or a piece of leather shoe-shaped as long as the bone. Then bind it from above as seems fitting to you, and adjust the wrapping until it is secure, so that it does not come undone. Order the patient to rest and calmness, and make his food a soft diet. If you think that something has changed in its shape in any direction, then attend to it on the third day.
Then bind it from above as seems fitting to you, and adjust the wrapping until it is secure, so that it does not come undone. Order the patient to rest and calmness, and make his food a soft diet. If you think that something has changed in its shape in any direction, then attend to it on the third day. Then smooth what you have applied with powder of frankincense, along with white of egg or fine breadcrumbs, after removing the splint from it. Place a poultice on the swelling, so long as that swelling clings to the bone and does not change its condition; then leave it be.
Do not remove it until the fracture has mended and strengthened. Often this fracture takes three weeks to strengthen, if a hot abscess appears during that time, then use what we mentioned repeatedly to subdue it until that abscess goes away.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then if there is a fragment or fragments of bone that have protruded, gently remove those fragments with what corresponds to your removal from the tool. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a file according to your need.
Then if you have removed those fragments and nothing remains, outline the mouth of the wound if it is wide, or else apply one of the remedies suitable for that. And close the wound until it heals.
The Fifth Chapter.
In Repairing a Fractured Clavicle.
The collarbone is more likely to fracture in front of the shoulder blade than at its end, and it usually breaks in one of three ways: either it fractures and separates into two parts without producing fragments; this is the easiest to repair.
And if the fracture produces fragments, which is more difficult to treat, or if it occurs with a wound, then the procedure would be as follows: if the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, have two attendants, one grasping the fractured vertebra and the other stretching the neck towards the opposite side.
Then you will shape the fracture with your fingers until it takes on its natural form and is free of notch or roughness. If needed, you should place a ball of linen or wool under the patient's armpit.
And the bone will be in the position you need, and then stretch and lift the vertebra and press the ball with your hand until the fracture takes on its natural form. If you are unable to pull one end of the vertebra outside due to it having sunk deep, then the patient should lie on their back.
And a pillow of medium thickness is placed under the patient's neckbone in the bone, and the attendant presses the neckbone down until the vertebra that was deep rises up above. Then the fracture is set and shaped with your fingers.
And if you feel that a fragment of the vertebra has cracked and is moving, then you should make an incision on it and carefully remove that fragment. If the fragment is lodged in the bone, then prepare one of the cutting instruments I have prepared for this purpose to cut it out. After that, place under the vertebra the instrument which holds back theomentum and this is an instrument made of wood or iron, as follows:.
It resembles a spoon with no roughness, and its width should be according to the size of the bone that you need, whether large or small. As for its length, it should also be according to what is possible for you to do, and it should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower as you see.
If the incision wound that you made when removing the bone fragment is wide and you fear the hot abscess, then close the edges of the wound with sutures. If the incision is small or you fear the hot abscess, then deepen the wound by cutting and tearing it to the extent of the incision.
If a warm tumor appears, then break the papyrus in rosewater and vinegar or drink, and place it on it. And if the bone is tightened without injury or splitting, it is that you place on the bone the poultice made from wheat bran with white eggshell. And you put a splint on it, and then you put a ball under his arm if needed, then take a long bandage that is one or two fingers wide, then wrap a compress made from a thin board. It should be three fingers wide and in length as well, then insert it into a cloth, then insert that cloth with the compress into the place on the bandage where the fracture is located, then tighten the bandage over the fracture like a spiral. And wrap it around his neck and under the sound arm and the affected arm, and wrap it several times on every side as you see fit, and how the tightening fixes the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And remember that the compress should not be removed from the fractured bone. And therefore the patient should be inspected every day, whenever the bandage has relaxed and you see that the compress has moved, then adjust it and tighten the bandage, then let the patient sleep on his back and put a small pillow under his arm at night.
So that his arm may rise with it and the fracture of the clavicle rises with the elevation of the shoulder or bind his arm to his neck, and do not remove the bandage unless a case occurs from a blister or swelling for twelve days.
Then renew the poultice if you see any signs of that. And wrap it tight and leave it until it heals and the fracture of the clavicle sets, and strengthens and grows stronger over twenty-eight days. It may be present in some people to a lesser extent.
The sixth chapter.
In repairing a collarbone fracture. It rarely happens that the collarbone breaks in its broad place, but rather it is the ends of it that break off; accordingly, whenever it does break in a certain spot or in the middle and this is known by touch, then according to what shape the fracture is in, form should be given to the repair.
To set it right and return it to its natural shape with all the skill you can, then apply to the place a poultice of wheat flour with egg white and linen thread and from above a broad plaster made of cloth.
Thin on the measure of the entire collarbone or slightly wider, if there is a swelling under the plaster in one of the places of the collarbone, then straighten that swelling with linen thread until the plaster lies flat, then pull from above with a long cloth.
Pull it tightly and secure the plaster so that it does not move from its place, and tighten the bandage every day; whenever the bandage relaxes, pull it tight again and adjust the plaster if it has moved from its place, and let the patient lie on their healthy side, and the collarbone will heal in twenty.
Or twenty-five days, and if this period has been completed, then release the bandage and you are safe; for it is one of the bones that do not fear breaking or collapse, but if a splinter of bone protrudes and was previously hidden under the skin, cut into it and remove it. And do what I mentioned in regard to a fractured wrist from reducing the inflamed swelling, if anything of that happens.
The seventh chapter.
In repairing a broken rib.
The chest may break in the middle and somewhat expose that, but its edges are more likely to break off and split apart; one of its symptoms if it breaks in the middle is that it will incline downwards and expose him to severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps the patient's blood pressure may increase and it becomes clear that the bone is fractured and not hidden from perception, and it is necessary for the patient to lie down on his back and a mattress is placed between his shoulders then his arms are bent and his ribs are brought together by his hands from both sides and he is laid flat as much as possible.
And wait until the shape of the bone returns as it should, then apply a dressing to it and wrap him with bandages and place a splint made from fir or sedge and similar materials on top of him in a sling after wrapping it in a cloth. Then wrap it tightly around the fractured bone so that it does not shift, and tie the bandage firmly onto his back several times, then check the bandage every time, and whenever it relaxes, tighten it.
And if necessity requires it, to remove it at the time of eating if there is exposure in that place or pain or swelling, then remove the dressing and treat what has appeared in a way that is suitable for its treatment, then apply the dressing again as needed. And so, and ensure it is tightened until he recovers.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of ribs if they are fractured, know that the fracture occurs in the hard areas below the back and its edges from the front, and it is exposed to view because they are dense and it is not hidden from perception when examined with the fingers.
And treat it by straightening the fracture with the fingers on the capable side until the shape becomes as it should, then dress and splint the broken bone if necessary. If the rib is fractured towards the inside, it exposes the patient to severe pain.
And it is like the bunch of thorns that exposes what has been done to those who have suffered from it, because the bone tears through the membrane and also exposes him to difficulty in breathing and coughing and profuse bleeding, and this is a difficult treatment, and the early physicians have employed many remedies in its treatment.
Some of them said that one should feed the patient what produces belching and flatulence so that the abdomen becomes inflated and expanded, and the fracture moves outside. And we dislike this lest it become a cause for the formation of a boil. If it did not happen, then if it has happened, it only increases in it and confirms it.
And some of them said that a compress should be applied to the place, then wrung out with force. It is similar to measuring, except that it is feared that the compress might draw moisture into the place due to its weakness. And some of them said that the place should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil.
And it becomes swollen in the area between the ribs until it is full, and the bandage is even then if it is wrapped around evenly. Then the patient is treated with treatment for spondylosis from food and medicine. If the patient is exhausted with something very severe that cannot be endured. And the bone presses against the membrane, pressing it in a deadly manner, and we fear for the patient. Therefore, we must incise the area, expose the broken rib, then lay beneath it the instrument which preserves the sac that was mentioned earlier. And we will cut the bone gently and extract it.
Then we will sew the edges of the wound if it is large, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If an abscess appears during that time, then we must be quick to apply a poultice of rose oil on the area and treat the patient with what calms the abscess from inside as well.
And he lies on the side that is most comfortable for him until he heals.
The Ninth Section.
In Repairing Fractures of the Back and Neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs and it is rare that this happens and more common that it becomes inflamed, similarly with the vertebrae of the back. If this happens to someone and you want to know whether it will heal or not. If you look, and you see that his hands are shriveled up and numb, and he is unable to move them or straighten them or bend them, and if you try to flex them or relax them with a needle without him feeling it or experiencing pain in them, then know that in most cases he will not recover; he is lost.
And if he can move them and feels flexibility and relaxation, know that the spinal cord is intact and the patient will recover with treatment. If a back arrow (presumably a reference to a specific injury or condition) occurs in this manner, and you want to know whether it will also recover or not.
So look at his legs, if you see that they are shriveled up and have happened to them what has happened to the hands, then when he lies on his back the wind and stool come out without volition, and when he lies on his stomach the urine comes out without volition. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate but is unable to do so, know that he is lost and do not worry about treating him. But if none of this occurs, then the matter is less severe, and treatment for what has occurred is to apply cold compression to the boil.
By applying rose oil alone or with roasted egg whites to the affected area, apply it three times a day until the boil subsides. Then, place one of the strengthened and moistened dressings on the spot, tie it securely, and order him to remain still and quiet.
He should not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain, until he recovers. If a bone fragment or something has broken off from the bone at the point of the boil, it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then, if the wound is large, you should stitch its edges together with thread. Then, treat it with ointments and creams until he recovers. If the last bone of the coccyx has been broken, it is necessary to insert the fingers of the left hand into the anus.
The broken bone is set with the other hand as much as possible, then the setting is stabilized and wrapped in cloth or bandage if needed.
If you find a shattered fragment in the wound, split it open and remove it, and treat the wound with treatment as mentioned until it heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
In Setting a Hip Fracture.
The vertebrae of the back do not easily break, but if they do, their breaking is that it becomes splintered at its edges and splits in length and tilts towards the inside and exposes itself to pain, numbness, and paralysis of the leg on its side.
And set it by passing your hand over it until you feel the shape of the break, and if the break is only in its edges, then set that break according to what presents itself to you from the setting until it resembles its natural shape.
If the break is in length or has tilted towards the inside, then prop the patient's body against his stomach until you can set that break. Then, after setting it, wrap it with a bandage and place a splint made of wood or leather over it, binding it tightly.
Do not fear for the break to move or the splint to fail, and set the unevenness of the wounds as much as it fills, until the binding takes on an even state. Order the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side, if a warm swelling presents itself.
Leave off applying the dressing and set him until the warm swelling subsides, then apply what soothes it according to what was mentioned before. Then return to setting him and bind him as is fitting, if something breaks off from his vertebrae or anything splits off from its edges; it should not be taken out.
And do not touch, but set him from the outside as we said, and leave his binding until he heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Fractures of the Upper Arm.
The upper arm is what lies between the shoulder and the top of the shoulder blade. If it breaks, treat it on one of two sides. One way is to take a straight, smooth stick of medium thickness in this shape:.
And bind it with two straps at its ends, then hang it from a high place and have the patient sit on a chair. Then, let them put their broken arm on the stick until their elbow is stuck in the middle of the bend of the stick, then hang something heavy above it.
Or have a servant hold it downwards, then the doctor will set the fracture with his hands together until the break returns to its proper place, and the other way is for the patient to lie on their back and have their hand tied to their neck with a strap.
Then command two servants to hold one above the break with their hands, and the other below it. Have each of them stretch in their direction. And if you want the traction to be stronger, tie a strap underneath the break and another on top, and have both servants pull in their directions.
If the break is near the shoulder blade, then it is necessary to have one strap under the armpit and the other under the break towards the elbow. And similarly if the break is near the elbow, then it is necessary to have a strap at that location and on the arm itself.
Then set the break gently without violence until the break is properly aligned and united with good consolidation, then splint it. If there is no inflammation, do not remove the splint for seven days, but apply a moistened cloth soaked in salt and rub with rose oil.
Until the inflammation subsides, then splint it. The method of splinting is to apply a compress on the break, then wrap a new cloth around the compress, and finally bring the arm together with itself and place the hand open on the shoulder blade.
Carry the stretch and tension on the shoulder and arm so that the arm stands in place of the splint, unless something prevents you from doing so or the broken bone changes its position. If it is likely to change its position, use the splint.
And it is that you place a splint on the break itself, which is wider and stronger than any other splints, and make three fingers' width between each splint, and the length of the splints according to the break, increasing by three fingers from all sides.
Then you tighten the tension on the splints as I mentioned earlier.
And it is that your tension should be stronger at the site of the break.
And whenever after the break the tension is less, if you see that the splints and tension are as we said when you immobilized the limb at the time of setting it, then do so.
And if you fear inflammation, leave the tension and splints alone. As we said, until the seventh day, then inspect the bandage every three days lest an abscess or swelling occur in the place, or nutrition be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tension, so that everything is as we mentioned.
And if you are confident that nothing of that will occur, do not remove the bandage except after many days, and the patient should lie on their back with their hand on their stomach, and a padded splint made from wool placed under the shoulder, moderate in thickness.
And inspect at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the broken limb be distorted or the bandage loosen, and make sure that everything is as you said by making an effort, and make the patient's food gentle at first until the bone has strengthened.
And it is necessary to strengthen his food, for it is customary for the shoulder and leg to heal in forty days, so when that time has passed, you should remove the bandage and use a warm bath, treating with lotions that are suitable for that, unless the break was severe and not consolidated.
Do not loosen the bandage for fifty days or two months.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Repair of a Broken Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones and it is called the humeri, one being small, which is next to the shoulder, and the other being large, which is situated below the small one from underneath. Therefore, sometimes only the largest humerus may be broken or only the smallest one may be broken, or they may be broken together.
When the upper small humerus is broken, its repair is easier and recovery is faster. When the lower large humerus is broken, its fracture is more severe and recovery is more difficult. If both humeri are broken together, then if the broken one is the upper small humerus.
It is necessary for the doctor when repairing it to make the splint gentle and easy until he straightens it. If the large humerus is the one that is broken, then he should make the splint stronger. If both humeri are broken, then he should make the splint even stronger.
And it is necessary to shape the hand when repairing and stretch the splint on a pillow, with the shoulder of the hand above all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the index finger resting upon itself.
And let the pillow be beneath it in elevation so that the index finger does not experience difficulty.
Then a servant stretches the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage, and another servant stretches it from above in like manner. Then the doctor straightens the bone until he puts it back to its best shape possible. If there are fragments of bone in the fracture, then he will reduce them.
Set each fragment in its place with effort. If a fragment appears to be exposed and is attached to the skin, and you have no hope of repairing it, then cut it off on the manner that we mentioned earlier. If there is a fracture with an open wound, then open up a pathway for him.
Treatment of that is taken from there, if an abscess appears in the first swelling and heat comes out; then smear a cloth with kohl mixed with henna and white beeswax, making it medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth tightly until the swelling subsides.
If you remove the kohl, put the prepared dressing on the dusty road with white egg whites, then carry the bandages and make the one that is placed on the break slightly wider and stronger, and know that the number of bandages for the arm is six in most cases.
The break was in one bone or in two bones together, then make your bandage tighter and stronger on the location of the break, and whenever you turn it up or down, make the bandage slightly looser as mentioned earlier in the first chapter.
And make the cloth that wraps around the break a soft, wet linen, not too hard, and let the thread that binds it be made of special cotton, medium between thin and thick as we described, and inspect the limb and bandage after days.
If something needs to be corrected, like a swelling appears in the limb, then wrap the limb with warm water until that swelling subsides, and leave the limb unbound at night until it rests, then resume binding.
If the binding has relaxed and the bone is displaced or almost so, then correct all that effort, and also look, if the food cannot reach the limb due to excessive binding, then loosen it a little and leave it for days until food reaches it, then bind again.
If nothing from what we mentioned appears, then it should not be resolved until after twenty days or so, then attach the patient's hand to their neck, and let their arm be moderate, and preserve his effort from irregular movements and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two, and possibly in twenty-eight days, all depending on the temperament and strength.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In Repairing Fractures of the Hand and Fingers.
Indeed, the palm of the hand and the tips of the fingers are rarely exposed to fractures, but rather they are frequently exposed to bruises, so when they are exposed to a fracture or bruise.
Then it is necessary for the patient to sit upright and in front of him a chair on level.
Then he places his hand on it stretched out, then the servant of the broken bones straightens them and the doctor sets them in good alignment. When this is done, it is necessary to apply a cast and padding if there is no hot swelling, then a splint is placed above as needed.
And I have wrapped it in a linen cloth. If the fracture is towards the bottom towards the palm of the hand, make a semi-spherical shape from the cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand then tie it with a long cloth.
And the cast should be made of skin, soft and pliable, so that it follows the curvature of the entire hand and is tied as needed. If the fracture is on the outside, it is necessary to make a cast above and another below in the hand, so that the hand remains open and standing.
Then the splint should be carried as the hand turns and is tied between the fingers with a bandage. If the fracture is in one of the finger tips, if it is the thumb then set it straight as needed, and then tie it with the hand, and if you wish to make a small standing cast to support the fracture.
And it should not be moved. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, such as the middle or ring finger, or pinky, then set it straight and tie it to the adjacent healthy finger, or tie all of them together with a bandage, for this is better; or place a small standing cast on top.
As we said in the ambiguity and were puzzled when you approached and departed from the hot tumor, then you would meet it as it should be whenever anything of that kind occurred as previously described.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
On Setting Fractures of the Thigh.
The thigh bone is often broken and appears to the touch because it moves forward and backward, and its setting will be by binding a band above the break and another below it, with the patient lying on his face.
Then each band is stretched by an attendant in its direction, according to this balance, if the break is in the middle of the bone; and if it is near the hip, it is necessary to bind a soft band either with wool or something similar.
At the hip to towards the groin, so that the stretch is above and the other band below the break; similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the band should be near the knee, so that the stretch is downwards. Then the doctor will straighten the bone with both his hands until it returns to its natural shape.
And the bone is straightened with a good union; then it is necessary to apply a dressing and compression, unless a hot tumor occurs in the member, in which case leave it for some days until the hot tumor subsides, then return to its treatment.
And as for compressing it, you should roll a thick and wide bandage around the break two or three times, leaving some of it over, then bend the leg until the ankle is at the origin of the fibula; and insert a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee from below and make the ends of the thread appear above on both sides.
Then turn the bandage around the leg and thigh as much as is left, then put poultices on the thigh in the same place as the break itself, and make one splint from it on the shin bone; and fill the gap between the thigh and leg with a soft cloth to level out the compression.
Then start by pulling the strong tendons from the middle to the break site three times or four, and each time you pull, make your pull weaker, softer, and gentler.
Then proceed to the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie on what follows from above. Then pass by the ends of the thread to the bottom until it reaches the ankle bone, and pull on both sides also.
So that the bandage does not come undone from its place, then leave the pull on it as long as the member does not become numb or swollen or inflamed or anything like that. If something like that happens, attend to it and correct what has happened in all of that as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a fragment of bone that protrudes, it is necessary to smooth it out if you can, and if not, split it open and remove it, and then treat the wound as we have mentioned earlier until it heals. This fracture may be pulled from the thigh without applying bandages to the leg.
As we mentioned in the arm and shoulder, except that this kind of splint does not cause a permanent disability if it is applied alone without including the leg, but the owner will always be lame.
And know that the thigh may take fifty days or a little more or less to heal, all of which is according to differences in temperament and other circumstances.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the fracture of the patella.
For the patella is rarely exposed to fracture and is often exposed to sprain, so if it does fracture, either it will split or break into its parts, and that may be with an injury or without.
And rely on all of that by sense, and splint it so that you smooth out what has separated into its parts with your fingers until it comes together and is reunited according to what you are able to smooth out and show compassion and skill. Then apply the dressing and place a splint on top if needed.
And it is pulled from above, corresponding to that; then it settles all the conditions we described in other fractures like hot tumors and so on, so that each opponent meets what is suitable for it until it heals.
The 16th chapter.
On setting the fracture of the leg.
Indeed, the leg has two bones: one thick and called the femur of the leg, and another thin and called the tibia, and it is exposed to various types of fractures that can occur in both arm bones. Therefore, setting it is like setting the arm bone, whether it is a single or double fracture; if both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions, and if the thinner bone is broken, the leg will turn forward, but if the thicker bone is broken and this occurs from below, that is something that should not be hidden from you.
So use the traction and alignment, and bind the splints according to that, whether or not; but if it is a severe leg fracture with many fragments, then the traction should be less and more gentle, and you must take great care in setting it.
And in the leg, there is something additional to what is found in the arm, which is that when you have set the splints and finished all your work, take two spruce saplings of about the size that are used to level out the grooves between the planks or made from palm fronds or similar.
And choose one of them that has a slightly thicker diameter and is not from the reeds, let its length be equal to the length of the leg from the knee to the foot, then wrap around each one a strip of cloth wrapped twice along its length, and place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
And let it be from the knee to the foot, then tie the two saplings in three places on both sides and the middle; for with this binding, the leg will not incline to the right or left and will be firmly set, and a wooden splint can also be used along the length of the leg.
He should place it to preserve him from movement and as much as is necessary when the fracture has a special wound, then he must inspect the leg every day with great care about the swelling or inflammation or any other such thing. If anything of that happens, he should treat it as is necessary for it to heal, and the bone of the leg will be consolidated in thirty days or so.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In fractures of the bones of the leg and fingers.
As for the ankle, it is not exposed to fracture at all, and as for the bones of the leg, they are sometimes exposed to fracture, and also the fingers, but very rarely, and in most cases, it is more susceptible to bruising.
If the leg bones are fractured and I have seen those bones come together, he should put the patient's foot on the ground standing upright like a mule, then you put your foot on what is raised of those bones and reduce it and straighten it.
until it returns to its place, then take the padding and gauze from above and put it under the sole of the foot as a small plate with two flat surfaces, then bind it tightly with the foot after wrapping it with cloth and all that is needed.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage, for you will find that the bones are set whether they were broken or not, and do as you see fit, but if some of the fingers have been fractured, then splint them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger, as long as the finger is and slightly thicker than it, then place this plate underneath the foot as I described to you and bind it tightly. If two or three or more bones have been fractured.
Then put a splint on each finger, as much as is needed, wrapped in a soft cloth and bind the plate to the sole of the foot, so that each end of the plate is outside the sole of the foot to hold it firmly.
You must not forget to treat all the fractures we mentioned, along with every injury that was mentioned, and respond to each condition as it requires.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
In the fracture of the woman's thigh bone and the shinbone of the man.
When the woman's pelvis is broken, place her on a stretcher then gently tilt her towards her back little by little and hold from behind, then fill the cleft in her pelvis with flax until it fills it and becomes like a ball in her pelvis.
Then the woman is shaken and her pelvis is lifted little by little, for that flax comes out until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the pelvis and returns the bone fracture, then she puts a pad on her back; whenever she wants to urinate, she removes the flax gently until she does.
And then return it to its original state or so, and then go back to her first pad; she does that for seven days or thereabouts, because it heals. And if you want to use a catheter, tie a tube around her mouth and insert the entire catheter into her pelvis.
Then blow into the tube with force until the catheter inflates inside the pelvis, and the fracture is restored. Then fill it with flax and keep it as we described for several days until it heals. And if a man's or woman's shinbone is broken, use this method to treat it.
And treat it as we described for the hip bone, and it will not be hidden from you what is correct in these unusual fractures that rarely occur, especially those who have some experience and understand this book well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
On the path of truth in treating it and setting it straight, understand this. And if a man's leg is broken at the thigh, with a swelling like an owl's wing, then insert the penis into it and place a cloth around it and bind it and leave it for three days or thereabouts until it heals.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In setting fractures of bones when accompanied by a wound.
It is necessary for one who presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large like the femur or humerus or similar to it, that you begin to expose it as soon as possible with the conditions of exposure as we have mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding blood, then it is necessary that you begin to apply a compress of powdered white bean to it if something else is not available. Then take up the reduction of the fracture on that very day itself and do not delay.
If there is no inflammation, then do not touch the fracture. But if there is inflammation, leave the reduction until the ninth day until the inflammation subsides; do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, because it will be accompanied by bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is exposed and protruding on the skin, it is necessary that you try to reduce and align it with your hand gently and a little bit. And if it does not come under your hand to reduce and align it, use this instrument which is made of iron, its length being about seven or eight fingers. And apply it according to the size of the wound.
And therefore it is necessary for the doctor to take four or five of them according to what he needs in each type of fracture, and they should be rounded so that they will not bend when pressed upon during work.
And it should be sharp on one side, with a curve at the end of that side, and its top thicker, while its middle part much thinner, and this is its shape:.
And it is called by the Greeks Perim, which means a small clamp, so it should be made with its sharp edge curved to fit onto the protruding end of the bone and pushed forward until the bone returns and settles slightly; then use this clamp to align the ends of the fracture against each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not take hold of it well, then one should cut off that bone until the instrument can grasp it. If one cannot manage to reposition the bone as we have described, then shorten it according to its natural fissures which we mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the rasps as best you can, then remove what remains on the bone from the roughness and fibrous scales. If after setting the bone you find that it is accompanied by a very severe and painful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can set it to its natural position, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the injured person. After completing your setting of the bone, dip a compress in a strong black gum and especially if you are in summer; do not place anything on the wound that is greasy or oily.
So that putrefaction and corruption do not occur; then use the lint when you are finished with setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, except to apply a layer of gauze on top of the folds as much as the size of the wound.
And beware with great caution not to suture the wound with the fracture, for many incompetent doctors have done so and caused their patients either death or gangrene or suppuration; and let your suturing be gentle and contrary to that of other fractures.
If the wound is old or large and some bad symptoms described by us appear on it, and he finds pain in the place which alarms him, then do not put lint on it; instead, make folds of hard linen in the place of the lint and suture him with it.
If after a day or two you see that the wound has begun to discharge pus, then remove from it the linen you placed on it with the ointment; then use the poultice and lotions which are our customary treatment for wounds like quadruple ointment and others. And you should untie the bandage.
The wound should be inspected daily morning and evening until it heals and closes, and it is necessary to elevate the part not allowing pus to flow from it easily. If the wound has passed many days and the pus has not ceased flowing from it, know that there are small fragments of bone remaining.
It is necessary to inspect the wound with a probe, and if any of those fragments are exposed, remove them and take them out. And if none of them are exposed but are causing the part to be tight and producing pain, then cut them off and extract them in whatever way you can do that.
If an abscess or ulcer or another kind of corruption and foulness appears on the wound, then it is necessary to treat each one according to its nature with the treatment that is described in its place.
And what you should bear in mind and prepare yourself for, is if a large bone breaks and a piece of it falls onto the member like the femur or vertebrae or similar major organs, do not touch it or try to remove it. For many times death results from that, so leave it alone until it becomes detached, for perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place where treatment is possible, otherwise leave it alone.
The Twentieth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Complications that Appear after Some Fractures.
This complication often appears after the healing of a fracture, especially when it is near a joint, and it can deform the member and perhaps prevent the member from performing its natural function.
Look, if the complication is soft and swollen, use medicines that constrict like saponin, myrrh, and aloe, or similar substances by taking some of them or all of them and mixing them with a constricting drink or egg white or vinegar.
She will wrap it in a cloth, and stretch it well and tie it tightly. Then she should leave the binding for many days before untying it again. She should repeat this process until the swelling goes away if Allah wills it, or apply a lead sheet to it firmly.
If the lead has a special property that removes all congestion in the organs, then if the swelling becomes hardened and intensified and necessity urges its removal, cut it from above and remove the fatty tissue that forms or divide it with some forceps until it disappears and treat the wound until it heals.
The Twenty-First Section.
In the treatment of a fracture, if it has healed and the member remains soft and pliable after that on account of its original nature.
If a bone fracture has healed and the member afterwards remains soft and weak, it is due to many reasons. One of the reasons is either excessive loosening of the bandages and binding it in a way that is not proper, or excessively tightening the bandages until nutrition cannot reach the member, or excessive manipulation, or excessive movements at the wrong time, or lack of blood in the patient's body and weakness.
And the treatment for that is to nourish the patient and strengthen his body until blood circulation increases in it, and to use warm baths, and to bring joy and happiness upon him, and so on. Then apply linseed oil to the member to attract it to receive much nutrition or to continue its manipulation with lukewarm water. until food flows into it and returns to its natural shape.
The Twentieth Section.
In the treatment of broken bones that have healed but are distorted and prevented from functioning as they should.
So when a member that has healed shows distortion or bending of the broken bone or swelling and is prevented from taking its natural shape. Unless the member has refused to perform its natural function, it is not proper that someone should claim to break the member from its head. And many of the ignorant doctors and operators have done so in our country.
And this deed is greatly reprehensible, leading to a great and unbearable harm. However, if the twist and complexity are acute, it should be treated with hot water in which the herbs like mullein leaves, its root, and king's crown, and similar things have been steeped.
And it should be treated with poultices of the steeped herbs, like tightly-made diachylon or taking the mullein root and striking it with chicken fat and cypress tree resin, then applying it. Or, taking the sweet date and pounding it with dove's droppings and similar medicines which are called "breakers" of inflammation.
And the complexity should be treated with continuous gentle massage using one's hands, and moving the member in all directions at all times. If the deformation has developed and worsened, and stiffness and pain have occurred, and necessity requires treating it with iron.
So it is necessary to make an incision above and release the connection of the bone, cut off what remains of the complexity or bone with fine cuts, and use gentle care in doing so. Then, treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The Twenty-Third Section.
The jaw is the displacement of a joint from its place, preventing movement and making the member ugly. It causes great pain and suffering to the sufferer. Therefore, whenever someone experiences jaw displacement, it is necessary that he act promptly to correct it.
He should not delay in the slightest, for if he delays, the place will become inflamed and it will be harder to correct the jaw. Therefore, he should not delay or procrastinate, but rather act promptly when it becomes inflamed, because many times it causes intense suffering and painful convulsions.
However, if that appears, it is necessary to advance to evacuate the abscess then leave until the tumor subsides slightly then wrap the member with hot water and fat then return gently and treat each member as mentioned in its place.
And I have arranged the chapters of the jaw according to what has been mentioned earlier in the fracture, from top to bottom of the body.
The 24th chapter.
In the treatment of the lower jawbone.
The maxillae rarely dislocate except in rare cases, and when they are removed, it will be on one of two faces; either they will slightly displace from their place and relax a little, or they will completely dislocate until they relax. Until it flows into the chest so that the patient's saliva drips and he is unable to hold onto it nor can he articulate his words by speaking, for if the dislocation is slight, it often returns of its own accord with minimal effort.
And if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its return with speed and not delay in the least, while having a servant hold the patient's head and the doctor inserting his single finger into the root of the jaw inside the mouth if the jaw is on one side.
Or he inserts all his fingers if the jaw is on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from outside manipulate it and orders the patient to open his mouth and let go so that it can move in each direction and the doctor manipulates the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to return and especially if both jawbones are involved, one should use the poultice with hot water and fat until it becomes easy to return, and not delay its return at all as we have said. If they return and settle and the patient's mouth fits together without relaxation, then apply to them a poultice of linen cloth that has been made from wax and fat and oil.
Then he binds him next to a slack band, and the patient's sleep will be on his back with his head slightly raised between two pillows so that nothing moves him to the right or left nor does he chew anything but makes his food easy.
Until the pain goes away and the jaw is set, he should eat what he wants, and use that bandage loosely without tensing up when eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is set and relaxed.
If the jaw becomes difficult to dislodge when it is stuck at some point and does not return to its place, many problems often occur from that, such as headaches and perpetual dizziness, or perhaps the patient's belly will run and they may vomit repeatedly, so if you see this, know that he is damaged.
And many people often die from that condition within ten days.
The 25th chapter.
In the setting of the jawbone and the corner of the neck.
As for the trapezius, it does not dislocate from the internal side due to its connection with the chest and can dislocate outwardly, and that will be evident by touch; and binding it requires the patient to lie on his back and stretch out his arms.
Then you should press the place with your hand firmly until it returns, then put on a compress and bandage and tie it, as for its side that is connected to the neck, it does not dislocate except in rare cases; if it were to dislocate one day, you should set it back and adjust it according to what we have mentioned and as seems best to you.
Then you should put on a compress and bandage and tie it, and order the patient to maintain gentle movement and calmness until he is relaxed, and with this very treatment, you can set right the corner of the neck if it has also strayed from its place.
The Sixth and Twentieth Chapter.
In the breaking of the neck vertebra.
Know that the neck vertebra breaks in three ways: one is that it breaks towards the armpit downwards, and the second is that it breaks towards the chest; and perhaps it may break above the neck vertebra, which is rare.
It does not break towards the back at the shoulder joint nor does it break forward at the point of the nerve, and more often it breaks and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have a thin build because it comes out quickly in them and enters quickly.
And as for those who have a thick build, it is the opposite, namely that it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty; and perhaps some people may suffer a blow or fall so that the neck vertebra becomes swollen and warm, and one may think it has broken, therefore one should investigate that until its soundness is confirmed.
Then one proceeds with its treatment, and identifies the break if it is towards the armpit downwards; if there is a gap between the broken neck vertebra and the healthy one, you will find a clear difference between them; you will also find that the head of the neck vertebra is damaged and under the armpit, when touched, the head of the neck vertebra is like an egg.
And the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or move it in all movements, and similarly if it has broken towards the chest or above, you will find that evident upon touch, not hidden.
And this break can be eased if it is fresh or the patient is young, and one should have a servant lift his hand up then place your fingers of your hand under his armpit and lift the joint with force upwards to its place and the servant should lift his hand and extend it upwards.
Then he should wrap it around the bottom, for it will return quickly. If it does not return as mentioned and the fracture has existed for several days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use the poultice that relaxes and softens like cooking the tops of cloves, hyssop, and royal crown in water and use it.
Then the patient lies on his back and places a wool ball under his armpit, moderate between relaxation and tension. Then the doctor places his leg on the ball and takes hold of the patient's hand with his own and stretches it down.
And pushes the ball with his leg, for it returns to its place. If you wish, he can be returned in this way: by having a taller man assist from the side and entering under the patient's armpit and lifting their arm up until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand down to their belly. If the patient is light, it is necessary to attach something else to hold them up, for then the fracture returns to its original state, and sometimes it also returns in another way.
And that is by concentrating on a long wooden beam with a rounded head like a plowshare, neither too thick nor too thin. Then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a linen cloth over the top of the beam and the patient stands along its length.
Then he stretches his hand down to the other side and also stretches his body on that side with force, for then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return it by all that has been mentioned, use this treatment: take a beam about two arm lengths in length. And make it four finger widths wide and two finger widths thick, with a rounded head to make it easy to enter the depth of the armpit in this shape.
Then he binds on the rounded head of the splint, a length of linen so that it will not cause harm to the injured limb. Then he places it under the armpit and stretches out his entire hand and arm down onto the splint, and binds the splint to the shoulder, elbow, and side of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a bar. The shoulder is raised and the hand is stretched down, leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side, for the joint enters from its socket. If it can be done in any way, then a moderate-sized ball made of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared poultice is carried from the mortar with gum and egg white, all over the shoulder, as it turns above. Then the ball is pulled tight under the armpit tightly, and his hand is tied to his neck with a bandage.
And he is left not to move his hand for seven days, and it is necessary that the injured person's sustenance be a little limited until the limb becomes strong, as it is easier to heal. Then after seven or five days, he will be exercised by movement, and if it holds up and does not stiffen, then he has recovered.
If the joint keeps on dislocating many times due to moisture or another cause, then it is necessary to use three Sufafids as mentioned in the book of Sufafids. If this is done and the bandage is released after seven days but the joint does not hold.
The poultice was reapplied and tightened on him many times, but it did not hold and fell off, and he became limp and could not be lifted up again. Then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed or stretched out or become limp. Then know at that moment that the joint will never stay in its place again.
What is to be cut that is towards the chest and breast and behind it, is done by pushing and applying with the hand until it returns, using all of the pulling and treatment until it heals. If an obstacle appears in the member and slows down its movement.
Let the healer apply the poultice repeatedly many times until that member becomes soft and returns to its natural state.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In the treatment of the arm fracture.
The arm joint becomes dislocated quickly and also returns quickly, and it dislocates in all directions, especially in front or behind, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is under the sight and under the touch to any shape of dislocation.
And if you compare the dislocated arm with the correct one, it will be clear to you by a visible explanation of the joint's position and it cannot bend its shoulder or lean on it, and it is necessary that you act quickly and return the dislocation to its place before a hot inflammation appears.
And if a hot inflammation appears, it is difficult to return it and may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is behind, for then it becomes worse than any kind of dislocation and more severe and painful, and many times death follows with it.
And if it is possible to return it, have a servant stretch out both his hands and arm, with the doctor's hand above the arm and below it, and he pushes the joint with all his fingers or with the tip of his thumb until it returns to its place.
And as for if the dislocation is in front, it can return by bending one's hand once until it hits the tip of the thumb that is adjacent to it. If the dislocation does not return, use strong forceful pressure, which is to have servants stretch out the arm.
The surgeon takes assistants also, lest it be lost at the wrist. Then the arm is straightened in every direction after it has been wrapped with a cloth or a broad bandage. If the doctor begins to manipulate the joint, he should anoint his hands with ointment so that it will be easy to dislocate the joint.
Then the joint is pushed with a strong push until it returns. And after its return, it should be dressed with a bandage that contains grip and drying with egg white, tightened firmly, and the arm should be tied to the surgeon's neck and left for some days.
Then it is undone. If the joint remains in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and leave it alone. And if you see that the joint has not become stable, redo the dressing and bandage and leave it alone for some days until it becomes stable, then undo it. If a swelling occurs after the joint's return and release.
And if the movement is difficult, let him use moistening in the bath and gentle rubbing and stroking until it becomes soft or put a fat goat's tail on the joint then tie it and leave it there for a day and night then remove it and enter the bath. If sweat occurs, make the joint sweat moderately.
Then apply it to him three times, with bath, until it becomes soft. And if you wish to put boiled cow's fat on him, greasy and smeared with fat, do that several times for he will become soft and return to its original state.
The 28th Chapter.
Treatment of Wrist Dislocation.
The wrist of the hand is often dislocated and its reduction is facilitated except for other joints. However, it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the moment it dislocates before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms.
Set the affected arm on a board and have a servant support it. The doctor should place his hand on the joint and press until it returns, except that he must look to see if the fracture has gone into the depth of the hand.
Let the patient place his outer hand on the board during extension and flexion. If the fracture protrudes to the surface of the hand, let him put his inner hand on the board so that the doctor's hand is on the same joint. Then he should be able to return it in time; otherwise, bind it with a compressive dressing for swelling.
Leave it alone, for it cannot be restored and will not tolerate being returned after some days have passed; except that the joint will remain in its dislocated state and the patient will suffer nothing, unless the hand becomes inflamed and is unable to grasp anything.
Then you will learn that the nerve has been cut or crushed, and there is no remedy for it except to bind with a ligature; perhaps it will be beneficial, and perhaps it will not. If the arm is returned, then wrap it with the dressing we described, and bind and leave it for five days.
Then loosen it and exercise the hand. If its movement is stubborn and there is something rigid in it, soak it with warm water and massage several times until it becomes supple.
The 29th Chapter.
In the treatment of finger fractures.
The fingers may dislocate in every direction. When a finger dislocates to the surface of the palm or its back, extend the finger and press the dislocation with your thumb until it returns, then bind the tip of the finger and fasten it towards the direction it dislocated to.
Leave it for two days then release it and extend it until it becomes straight by day. If during the night you bind it as described, do not loosen it during the day but exercise it with movement and bind it at night; do that for several days until it hardens.
And you will do the same thing with it if it detaches to the inside of the hand, tying it to the same direction and doing with it what you did first until it is healed, and you will do the same thing with it whenever it detaches to any other directions.
The thirtieth chapter.
In the treatment of a broken vertebra.
When a vertebra or the neck vertebra is broken, or it is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are separated from their places, then there is no treatment for it because death will quickly reach the sufferer.
And a sign of that is that the sufferer's stool comes out without his will and he cannot retain it, and often some of his members become paralyzed, either his legs or his arms or one of them, and if one vertebra becomes detached from its place then many do.
And its dislocation will be to four directions, and the one that is detached to the back is called a haddah, and as for its treatment, it is that you should look at it; if the haddah has occurred from old age then there is no treatment for it whatsoever, but if it occurred from a fall or a blow or something like that.
I mentioned them previously with a lengthy treatment by which most of it does not lead to benefit, and I summarized what was needed from the majority in my approach, explained it, and corrected the device contrary to what they showed and explained.
I say that the haddah which occurs in front of the chest has no cure and cannot be healed, and likewise those on both sides also, but only the one which occurs in the back is treated as I described it, and that is by having the sufferer lie down on his face.
On a brick bed that is level and close to the wall, spread a wet cloth underneath and put a pillow for him so his chest does not get hurt, then place a wooden beam standing upright in a hole in the ground at the head end of the bed, and another beam at the foot end.
And a servant holds the board, and it should not be secure in the pit, and another servant holds the other on that form then wraps it around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft and tight bandage and stretches the end of the bandage to the board that is at his head and ties him in.
Then it wraps with another bandage above his shins, and above his knees, and at his ankles then gathers all the bandages together and ties them in the other board that is at his feet then each servant stretches to their side of the board with the bandage and the two boards do not move from their fixed positions.
Unless they are not secure as we said, and the doctor puts his hands on the splint with force until it returns or puts a board on it then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return by this treatment, he takes a board that is about three arm-lengths long.
And he digs in the wall which we said should be near the patient's place, and enters the end of the board into it then puts the middle of the board on the notch and the doctor's feet are at the other end and tightens it tightly until the splint is compressed.
And it returns to its place, and if you want to make it with the screw which is twisted by hand, he inserts it into the ground near the patient's head at the end of the trench, two wooden boards being a forearm long, and also at his feet at the end of the trench.
And it is so that after every two boards, a span of space is left, and in each board there is a hole made for the screw to go through, and all the wood is secured in the ground firmly so that it does not move at all and enters an iron rod slowly which is the screw that tightens the bandage in the holes of the two boards.
On its side, a hole has been drilled where a stick of a span long is inserted which bends and in the other two pieces like that. Then the bandages are tightened on the patient's chest in the loop that is at his head and the bandages that were tightened on his legs in the loop that is at his feet.
Then he stands at each loop, a servant unfolding his hand with the instrument that bends the loop, and the doctor adjusts the notch as we have mentioned, and this is the picture of the loop, the splint, and the patient.
Then, after the swelling subsides and the position is evened out, it is necessary to place a dressing of dried lint on top of the bandage, then the poultice, and put a splint from a flat piece that is three fingers wide or so, and its length should be as long as takes up the notch's position.
And on some of the correct beads, then it is bound with a bandage that needs to be used, and the patient should eat soft food until they recover. If there remains some swelling in the position at the end of the recovery period, it is necessary to use medicines that soften and loosen with the use of the splint we described for a long time.
And sometimes a lead sheet is used for that, and if there remains some swelling at the end of the back's vertebrae, it may be thought to be a dislocation and this can be an excessive bone that has protruded, so do not approach it with this treatment, as death may result.
The 30th Chapter.
In the Treatment of a Paralyzed Thigh.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the loin are only exposed to the flexion, but they are not exposed to what other joints are exposed to, such as slight rotation and sinking, and the joint of the hip is bent on four sides.
Therefore, it is dissected to the inside and outside and forward and backward, and more so to the inside and less so to the front or back. And the sign of its dissection to the inside is that if you join the healthy limb with the injured one, it will be longer.
And the knee will be bent more than the healthy one, and the injured person cannot flex their leg when walking; and the position that follows walking will become clear to us before the top of the thigh has reached there.
And the sign that exposes it to outside is contrary to these symptoms; and the sign that exposes it to forward is that he straightens his leg to its full extent, unless there is pain in the knee, but if he intends to walk, he will not be able to do so forward.
And he holds his breath and trembles his thigh, and when walking, his step falls on the heel; and the sign that exposes it to back is that he does not straighten the knee nor can he flex it before flexing the thigh, and his leg will also be shorter than the other.
And the thigh is relaxed, and the top of the femur is at the level of the pubic bone clear; and as for the return of this wound, it is that you look: if the wound is old and has become chronic with its owner and has not been attempted to be reversed and has remained in its state, then there is no cure whatsoever.
So it is not suitable to expose it; and as for the one whose wound is new, regardless of what type it was from the four sides of the wound, then hasten to manipulate the joint, stretch it inside and outside, and move it left and right, so that maybe.
He returns and does not need any other treatment; if he does not return like this, then it is necessary to prepare a servant with a strong arm, one to stretch his leg from the bottom either by his hands or by a rope that binds above the knee, and another servant to support him from above.
That the operator should enter his hand from underneath his armpit, then tie a thin cord around the origin of the thigh and grasp the end of the cord with a servant's hand, the extent of which may be either in front from the direction of the scapula to the direction of the popliteal fossa or else behind towards the direction of the back.
And all of them should be in one extent until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of extent is common to the four types; if the jaw returns as we mentioned or else, it will be necessary for each type that I have mentioned to have its own specific treatment.
However, if the jaw returns to its original position, then the patient should lie on his correct side and a cord should be placed around the origin of the thigh between the head of the femur and the location underneath the scapula.
Then the bandage should be extended upwards from the direction of the scapula to the top of the body towards the popliteal fossa, and another servant should grasp with his strong arms and hold the thick part of the upper thigh and extend it outside with great force, for it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than all the other types of treatment that involve returning this member to its place; if it is difficult for you and does not allow you to enter into this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary to bind the patient's legs altogether with a strong cord, thin on the ankles and knees.
And it will be after each of them, the amount of four fingers, and the upper leg will be extended more than the other one by two fingers, then the patient will be suspended on a beam in the house, being two arms' length above the ground.
Then order a strong servant to grasp the head of the femur and another servant to suspend the patient, and push with all his might the servant who is grasping the femur, for the joint returns to its place quickly; as for returning it to its original position if the jaw is outside.
The patient should be laid down on the operating table as we described in "The Owner of the Wound". The bandage should be tightened on his injured leg, especially, and on his chest. Then two sticks are placed one at his feet and the other at his head. An additional stick is placed in the middle of the operating table firmly.
A moist cloth is wrapped around it so that the patient does not get hurt. So that the stick is between his thighs, lest he slide down when he leans forward. Then each servant approaches his side and the doctor adjusts the ankle with his hands, if possible.
Unless that, a board is placed on him and it is secured as we mentioned in "The Owner of the Wound", regardless. However, it is necessary for the patient to be laid down on his healthy side, and if the wound is towards the front, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this position on the operating table.
And the doctor places his right hand on the upper edge of the wound, then presses it with the other hand, yet keeps the pressure extended downward to the knee level. If the wound is at the back, it is not necessary for the patient to lean down.
And he is raised above the ground but it is necessary for him to be placed on something solid, just as his foot should be bent outward according to what we mentioned from his position on the operating table and he is facing down with the bandages tightened.
As we mentioned earlier, it is necessary to use the clamp on the board also at the location where the joint has come out. If the ankle joint has returned to its proper position as it should be and there is no sign of its return, which is that the patient's leg extends.
If you see them staying in place and the patient is flexing his leg without any difficulty, then know that the joint has returned to its proper position. At that time, bind the thighs together and apply the bandage with a knot that does not allow the ankle to move in any direction.
It is necessary for the surgeon. The rest is three or four days, then loosen the bandage and poultice and split the leg with another one, if you see them equal in size, know that the break has healed, so release the patient to walk, and if you see something of relaxation.
Go back and reattach it, and tie it as you did at first, and leave it also for three days, then loosen it. And gradually increase her walking on it until she is well, if Allah wills.
The second and thirtieth sections.
In the treatment of a fractured knee.
The knee fracture is on three sides, it fractures inward and outward and downward, meaning backward, but does not fracture forward at all. And the sign of its fracture is that the surgeon should bind his leg to his thigh.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is fractured. And if all its fracture faces are united, then have the surgeon sit down with his legs outstretched as much as he can manage and have a servant sit behind him to hold his middle and tie it slightly back, then you sit on his thighs.
And lean your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them between your fingers on his knee. Then tie his knee with force on both sides with your hands, and another servant will extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the thigh in a smooth, natural way without being forced. Then bind it and stick the leg to the thigh, then tie them altogether with three or four bandages. Then release them, and he should not use anything except for light walking until she gets strong.
If it is difficult for you to make her return as we described, and otherwise use the strong stretching with bandages that I mentioned in the treatment of a fracture until she returns.
The Chapter Thirty-Third.
In the treatment of a broken ankle.
The ankle may become dislocated by a slight degree or entirely, and the dislocation may be either inwardly or outwardly. A sign of dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
And as for the treatment of a slight dislocation, it is easy to reduce and involves gently stretching his arms out and aligning him until he returns to normal. And if it has become entirely dislocated, then the patient should sit down and be held by a strong servant or attendant from behind his back in the middle.
Then grasp his right hand with your right hand from above and his left foot from below at the ankle joint, then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand towards the shin without force.
You should do that twice as we described, then push the front of the foot towards the shin in the third time while pulling on the ankle joint. If it returns to its normal shape in one or two attempts and you see the foot is straight, but if not, then repeat the process until it does return.
And if it does not return as we described, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground and grasp his thighs securely to prevent him from falling between them, having wrapped a cloth around them so that he is not hurt, then the attendant should hold his thigh.
Then another attendant should hold the patient's leg, either by his hands or with a strap tied around his ankle, then each attendant should pull in the opposite direction of the other, and the splint should be held between the patient's thighs to prevent his body from moving downwards during the process, then the physician should straighten the joint with his hands.
And the servant grasps the healthy leg down below, then the jawbone returns quickly. If the jawbone returns and you see its correctness, then carry the poultice and gauze and bind it with strong ties, and secure the foot with a tie down below. One must beware of the nerve that is above the ankle from behind.
So that the tie is not too tight and hurts him, then leave it for two or three days. If the swelling subsides, bind it again and then release it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he walks before this period, it is not guaranteed that the jawbone will not be damaged and spoiled, nor will it accept treatment after that. If a hot abscess appears, one should use what we described earlier to treat it in any other place of the wound until it passes.
The 34th Chapter.
Treatment of the Finger Bones of the Hand.
It is necessary to straighten what has become bent with a slight extension without force, which is not difficult but easy. If the finger bone is in some of the joints of the foot, then it is necessary for the patient to place his foot on a level surface from the ground.
Or on a board, and he is standing like a horse. Then get up and put your foot in what remains of those joints, and then press it with your foot with strength until it returns and you see that it has straightened and does not show any defect in the place.
Then put a board under the arch of his foot, and it will take all the toes, making two rows. Then bind it tightly and securely for three days, then release it and keep him away from walking for many days until it strengthens and is guaranteed to return if God wills.
The 49th Chapter.
Types of jawbone that occur with a wound or fracture or both.
When something of that sort occurs and the swelling is treated and sutured, it often results in death.
Therefore, it is not permissible to attempt treatment of that sort unless one is experienced in the craft, having spent many years learning and practicing with patience and compassion, not being reckless or hasty, and initially using medicines that calm hot swellings only, and then allowing the patient to recover.
Praise be to God except for what I have hoped for in the patient's recovery from the injury, with a slight improvement in their condition and some hope evident in their face, so that you may cure them at the first opportunity before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to its normal condition, use the treatment that calms hot swellings and treat the wound with ointments suitable for it. If the jawbone is fractured and there are detached fragments of bone, remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned regarding simple diseases and their treatment in their places.
And strive with all your might and cleanse yourself of entering the path of evil as we have instructed you, for that will be to your benefit and salvation if God wills.
