On the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh that has grown in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes, in certain people's eyes, a reddish flesh grows or accumulates until it covers the pupil or approaches, or presses upon the eyelids, and it may even turn the eyelids outward; and it resembles the pomegranate flower.
And the procedure for this is also for the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or fingers.
Then cut into the flesh at first, until it is fully removed with the scalpel.
And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and make your incision, either with the spatumili, as we described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors, with which asebel is gathered, as will be explained in the following chapter.
When your incision is complete and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or sprinkle it with red powder, or similar corrosive medicines; and place a cotton pad over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot swelling.
If anything remains of the alguardenici, and warm blood overpowers you, and you fear a hot swelling, then leave the eye, and treat it with what calms the swelling.
Then repeat the procedure on it until it is healed.
And do likewise with any additional flesh that grows in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treatment of any weak eye by natural or incidental means when operating with a blade: and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part is able to withstand that procedure.
