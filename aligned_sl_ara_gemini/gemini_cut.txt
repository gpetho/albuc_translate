The author of this book said: When I completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, because practical work and its practitioners are completely nonexistent in our country and in our time, so that its knowledge almost disappeared and its impact vanished.
Only minor traces of it remained in the books of the predecessors, which have been distorted by hands and affected by errors and confusion, so that its meanings became obscure and its benefit distant, so I decided to revive it and compose this treatise in the way of explanation, clarification, and brevity, and to provide images of cautery irons and other surgical instruments, as this is an addition to the explanation and among the most important things needed.
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the study of medicine is long, and its student should be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy described by Galen, until he understands the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, separations, knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and exits, and the pulsating and static veins, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that doctors are many in name but few in practice, especially in surgery.
We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book, because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people with it, as I have seen many of those who imagined themselves knowledgeable in this science and claimed it without knowledge or skill.
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor who incised a scrofulous swelling in a woman's neck, so he pierced some of the arteries of the neck, and the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another doctor who proceeded to extract a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder, and the stone was large, so he rushed and extracted it with a piece of the bladder, so the man died after about three days.
I was called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I estimated about it.
And I saw another doctor who was earning a living with some of the leaders of our country through medicine, and a black boy who had a fracture in his leg near the heel with a wound happened to be with him, so the doctor hastened in his ignorance and tightly bandaged the fracture over the wound with pads and splints, and he did not leave any breathing space for the wound, then he left him to his desires, then he left him for days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death, so I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage, so he felt relief and recovered from his pains, except that the infection had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not stop it, so the infection continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another doctor who cauterized a cancerous tumor, so it ulcerated after days until his affliction worsened, and this is because if cancer is purely of melancholic humor, then it should not be exposed to iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can be completely amputated.
Therefore, my son, you should know that surgery is divided into two parts: a safe procedure and a procedure that is harmful in most cases. I have warned in every place that comes from this book about the procedure that has risks and dangers, so you should beware of it and reject it so that the ignorant does not find a way to speak and criticize. Take for yourselves firmness and precaution, and for your patients, gentleness and certainty, and use the best way that leads to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to diagnose, and purify yourselves from what you fear will bring you suspicion in your religion and your world, for it is more lasting for your prestige and higher in this world and the hereafter for your status.
Galen said in some of his advice: Do not treat a bad disease, so you are called bad doctors.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, organized and arranged from head to toe, with images of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for surgery.
The second chapter is about incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and so on, all organized and arranged with images of instruments.
The third chapter is about bone setting, dislocations, treatment of tendons, and so on, organized and arranged from head to toe with images of instruments.
The first chapter on cauterization.
And before we mention the procedure with it, it is necessary that we mention the nature of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
So I say that the discussion about the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a group of sages have spoken about it and differed about it.
And I have summarized from their words the little, for fear of prolixity.
So I say that cautery is generally useful for every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they have differed about it, so some of them said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite of that, that cautery is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is impossible to be cured from a hot dry disease with a hot dry remedy.
And the one who says the opposite of that said that cautery with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in people's bodies, because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say according to his saying because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that it is not appropriate for anyone to imagine about that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the field of cautery with extensive training and has observed the difference in people's temperaments and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
And as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially the cold, moist diseases, for all the physicians have agreed on them and have not differed about the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cautery with fire, and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, because fire is a simple substance whose action does not exceed the organ that is cauterized, and it does not harm another organ connected to it except with slight harm.
And cautery with burning medicine, its action may extend to what is beyond the organs, and perhaps it causes in the organ a disease whose treatment is difficult, and perhaps it kills.
And fire, due to its nobility and the generosity of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
And that has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service and care for the craft and observing the realities of the matter, and for this reason I have dispensed with lengthy speech.
And were it not that it is not appropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you regarding fire a mysterious secret and the nature of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative words that are too subtle for your understanding.
And know, my sons, that they have differed about the time in which cautery is suitable, and they have considered the best time to be the time of spring.
And I say that cautery may be suitable in every time, because the harm that occurs from the time is absorbed in the benefit that is brought about by cautery, especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay, because it is feared that they will be followed by a calamity that is greater than the slight harm that comes from the time.
And do not let it occur to your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cautery that cures from a certain disease will never return, and you consider it blameworthy.
And the matter is not as you thought, because cautery is just like the medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures that are the cause of the occurrence of pains, except that cautery is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease will return at some point in time, depending on the temperament of the patient, the establishment of his disease, its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and such causes.
However, unless the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in an organ with few superfluities and moistures, such as cauterizing the tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that the pain will not return in it, and that is in the minority of cases.
And as for the saying of the common people also that cautery is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not in what they mean, because they believe that no treatment is beneficial with medicine or otherwise after cautery occurs, and the matter is contrary to that, but rather the meaning that cautery is the last of medicine is that when we use various types of treatment for a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use the last thing, cautery, and it works, so from here it happens that cautery is the last of medicine, not in the sense that the common people and many of the ignorant physicians mean.
And the ancients have mentioned that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they only said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the place of cautery does not suppurate, and that is not absolute, because I have tried that and found it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cautery with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire from gold, it will not be clear to you when it heats to the extent that you want, due to the redness of gold, and because coldness quickly affects it, and if you increase the heating on it, it melts in the fire and flows, so the craftsman falls into trouble because of that, so therefore cautery with iron is faster for us and closer to correctness for the procedure, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections that I have organized from head to toe, to facilitate for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
The first chapter on cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness on the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent catarrh from the head towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, throat aches, and in general, for every disease that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, muteness, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habit. Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then sit him cross-legged between your hands, having placed his hands on his chest. Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is like this:
Expose from the bone the size of a toothpick head or the size of a cherry pit, then lift your hand. Otherwise, repeat with the same iron or another one if it has cooled down, until you see the bone as I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak cotton in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the burn from the fire disappears. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until he recovers, God willing.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open and suppurates, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then the burned part of the bone is scraped, and then treated.
Others have said that the cauterization should be exaggerated until it has a strong effect on the bone, so that something like a carat or a small disk falls off the bone. They claimed that it vents the vapors of the head from that place, and the wound is left open for a long time, then treated until it heals.
I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people, and by way of risk, and leaving it is better in my opinion. And safety, if it exists, is because the head weakens when its natural connection is severed, as we have seen in other organs, especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so work with it, and you will be safe, God willing.
The second chapter on cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic headache occurs and it lasts for the patient, and he has used eardrops, sternutatories, nasal instillations, ointments, and bandages, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we described, and none of that benefited him, then consider: If the patient's head is naturally strong in constitution, and he is not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize him with another cautery slightly above that one. ثمّ اكوه على كلّ قرن من رأسه كيّة حتّى يذهب ثخن الجلد وينكشف من العظم القدر الذى وصفنا
And I will mention this cautery in its place.
It is appropriate that the cautery iron used to cauterize the horns of the head and its back be gentler than the cautery iron used to cauterize the middle of the head.
The third chapter on cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in the fissure of the head along with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then induce vomiting in the patient with medicines that purify the head, and employ all the other treatments that I mentioned in the classification of diseases. فإن لم ينجع ذلك فالكىّ فيها على وجهين
As for cauterization with a burning medication, it is that you take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. ثمّ شقّ موضع الوجع من الصدغ بمبضع عريض حتّى يصير فيه موضعا تحت الجلد يسع فيه السنّ فيدخل فيه تحت الجلد حتّى يغيب
Then tighten it with a bandage, tightly, and leave it for about fifteen hours. ثمّ حلّه وأخرج الثوم واترك الجرح يومين او ثلثة
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications that I provided in the eighteenth article on burning medications.
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is in this manner: you heat the cautery iron, which is of this form:
And it is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, with some curvature and a small protrusion in its middle.
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be like half of it, and you lift your hand so as not to burn the artery that is underneath, causing bleeding.
Then you soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days, then you load the cotton with ghee, then you treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like edge coming from the cautery, and be careful of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if it's not chronic.
Chapter four on cauterizing chronic migraine.
If you treat migraine with the aforementioned advanced treatment and what we mentioned in the classification of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see that the ailment is not resolved by what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to heat the knife-shaped cautery iron until it becomes white after marking the painful area with a line half a finger long or so, and you withdraw your hand at once while pulling it tight until you cut the artery and reach the bone, except that you should be careful of contacting the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
Be careful and vigilant about bleeding from the artery that you cut, as there is danger in cutting it, especially for those who are ignorant of what they are doing and have not been trained and experienced, and it is better to leave the procedure.
The management of accidental bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing.
If you find that the ailment is not resolved by this cauterization and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on dissecting the artery with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
The fifth chapter on cauterizing earaches.
If there occurs in the ear pain from cold. وعولج بالمسهلات وسائر العلاج الذى ذكرنا فى التقسيم ولم يذهب الوجع.
Then you apply drops with it, after heating it, around the entire ear as you go around, or around both of them if the pain is in both. وتبعد بالكىّ من أصل الأذن قليلا بعد أن تعلّم الموضع بالمداد
And the cautery should be the size of ten dots in each ear, or about that.
Then you treat the places until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six on Cauterizing the Jaw Muscle.
The facial paralysis that is treated with cautery is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of facial paralysis with errhines, sternutatories, and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: one at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because the relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
And the method of cautery is to cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb. تنزل بالكّى يدك حتّى تحرق قدر نصف ثخن الجلد،
And this is the image of the cautery instrument, and it is a type of scalpel-like instrument whose image has been presented, except that it is a little gentler, as you see.
And the knife should have a little extra thickness.
Then treat the area with what was mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.
The seventh chapter on cauterizing chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment has not been successful, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations, one on each side of his head. وكيّة فى وسط الرأس كما ذكرنا
And the description of the cauteries is as previously mentioned.
And he may also be cauterized at the pit of the stomach, which would be more effective.
Then treat with what has been previously mentioned.
The eighth chapter on cauterizing forgetfulness that is caused by phlegm.
The patient should first be given to drink from the major electuaries and brain-purifying pills.
Then his entire head should be shaved. وتحمل على مؤخّره ضماد الخردل المكتوب فى مقالة الاضمدة
Apply it several times, for it is a kind of cautery. وافعل ذلك على الرتبة بعينها التى ذكرتها هنالك
If he is cured by that, then fine, otherwise cauterize him with three cauterizations on the back of his head, aligned from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck. واجعل بين كلّ كيّة وكيّة غلظ اصبع
Then treat the cautery with what was mentioned previously.
If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization. فإن اردت الزيادة فاكوه على القرنين
Then treat him until he recovers.
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form that was described before.
Chapter nine on cauterizing paralysis and the relaxation of the entire body.
It is necessary to proceed in purifying the head with the irriagations and what we have mentioned.
Then shave the head of the sick person. ثمّ اكوه كيّة فى وسط الرأس وكيّة على كلّ قرن من الرأس وكيّة على مؤخّره وثلاثا على فقارات العنق
If you need more than that in the illness of relaxation of the body and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and entrenched. فاكوه أربع كيّات على فقارات ظهره
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.
The tenth chapter on cauterizing epilepsy.
Only cauterize the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
It is necessary to first purify his brain with major purges and with all the treatments that we mentioned in the section if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medications.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate the medications, then he should use gargles and masticatories that purify the brain for many days before that, along with improving his nutrition, then shave his head, then cauterize him with a single cauterization in the middle of the head as described previously, and another cauterization on his posterior, and a cauterization on each side of his head.
If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauterizations that were mentioned for the one with paralysis and body relaxation on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped according to the description that was presented earlier.
If the patient is a child, then make the cautery iron gentle in this way:
Chapter eleven on cauterizing melancholia
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize him with the cauterizations that we mentioned for the stroke patient.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclining towards black bile, and the patient's body is moist, give him to drink what purifies his brain as mentioned previously in the classification. ثمّ احلق رأس العليل
Then make a well-sealed ring-like cake of linen. ثمّ أنزلها فى وسط رأسه والعليل قاعد متربّعا يمسك من كلّ جهة
Then take one pound of old sheep fat. ثمّ سخّنه على النار سخونة معتدلة قدر ما يحتمل الاصبع اذا أدخل فيه
Do this to the patient once every week, along with all his other good management, until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted cauterizations, without holding your hand on the cautery iron, but rather with a quick touch.
For this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton soaked in the fat or in chicken fat.
The twelfth chapter on cauterizing the water descending into the eye.
If the beginning of the descending water in the eye is clear to you by the signs that were mentioned in the classification, then hasten to give the sick person what purifies his head, and protect him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath on an empty stomach for days.
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head. ثمّ اكوه كيّتين على الصدغين إن كان ابتداء نزول الماء فى العينين جميعا او من الجانب الواحد إن كان فى العين الواحدة.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cauteries be long across the width of the temples, and beware of bleeding, so if you see any of it, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will come to the wisdom in stripping the arteries and cutting them and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized on the nape of the neck under the two bones with two deep cauteries.
The thirteenth chapter on cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and permanent, and they are due to the veins and arteries that are on the surface of the head, from outside the head وتيقّنت أنّ ذلك من فضول باردة غليظة بلغمانيّة
The fourteenth chapter on cauterizing the stinking nose.
If you treat him with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not successful, then quickly give the sick person nutmeg for three nights. ثمّ احلق رأسه
And be careful of the artery, do not cut it.
And this is the image of the nail-shaped one:
Chapter fifteen on cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid becomes flaccid due to illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize him slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep away from the temples. ويكون طول كلّ كيّة على طول الحاجب
And do not overdo your hand with the cautery, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burned.
And the shape of the cautery iron should be according to this description.
Chapter sixteen on cauterizing the eyelid if its lashes turn inwards and prick the eye.
So cauterization in it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by a burning medication.
As for cauterizing it with fire, you order the patient, before that, to leave his eyelashes, if he is among those who pluck them, until they grow long and even. فإن نخسته عند نباتها فتشدّ عينيه بعصابة لئلّا تتحرّك حتّى تنبت
When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap. ثمّ تعلّم على جفن العين بالمداد علامة على شكل ورقة آس
Then you place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium seed mucilage.
Then you heat a cautery iron, this is its image:
Then cauterize on the shape that you marked, little by little, in many times until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned, especially its surface.
And the sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye, so lift your hand then and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with ghee on it until the eschar falls off, then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.
If any of the hair returns after a while and the eyelid relaxes, repeat the cauterization on that place as you did first.
If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye.
As for cauterization with the burning medication, it is that you order the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and even, then you make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf, then take from the usual soap and from the quicklime, not slaked, of each one the weight of a dirham or so, and you grind them both well, and you do that quickly lest it dry, then you spread it on the paper that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes, and you place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap, and you place your index finger over the medication and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medication, because he feels a sting like fire, so as long as he feels the sting, leave the medication and move it with your finger, and when the sting subsides, remove the medication and wash the eye with water and look. If you see the eyelid has risen as it rises when curling with fire or cutting, otherwise, reapply some of the medication on the area where the medication did not affect and did not blacken until you complete your work and the eye curls up, then place cotton with ghee on it until the burning scab falls off, then treat it with the palm ointment or another until it heals.
And it is necessary for you, when working, to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye.
If the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear something from the hair in the eye, reapply the medication on that area of the eyelid that relaxed, specifically as you did first, then treat it until it heals.
And this is a picture of a myrtle leaf:
And know that people's eyes may differ in smallness and largeness. فعلى حسب ذلك فليكن تشميرك
And the correct way is not hidden from one who has practice in this profession.
The seventeenth chapter on cauterizing the fistula that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treated the fistula with what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases and your treatment was not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You order the patient to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head between your hands, holding it firmly so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium mucilage on his eyes.
Then you heat the cautery iron, which is of this shape:
It should be hollow, like the quill of an eagle's feather, from the one end which will be cauterized.
And if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end. وإن شئت كانت مصمتة كالمرود
But this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove the pus and dry it. او كان غير مفتوح فتفتحه وتستخرج قيحه
Then apply the cautery, which is very hot. فتمسك بها يدك حتّى تصل الى العظم
And move your hand a little during cauterization from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand err or the patient fidget, and the cautery falls into the eyelid and damages it.
If it reaches the bone with the first cauterization, وإلّا فأعد المكواة مرّة ثانية إن احتجت الى ذلك
And leave it for three days. ثمّ احمل عليه قطنة بالسمن وعالجه بالمرهم المجفّف حتّى يبرأ،
If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed. واجرده على ما سيأتى ذكره فى بابه إن شاء الله،
And another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients, تعمد الى موضع الناصور تشقّه ثم تضع فى نفس الشقّ قمعا رقيقا هذه صورته:
And it is advisable that you place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead cauterizes the fistula's location and heals it wonderfully.
If the fistula is healed by what we have mentioned of cauterization and treatment, then good; otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage as will come in its specific place.
Chapter Eighteen on Cauterizing Cleft Lip
Often there occurs a fissure in the lip called the hair. ولا سيّما فى شفاه الصبيان فإنّه كثيرا ما يحدث.
If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery in this way:
Its depth should be as thin as a knife.
Then you place it hot, quickly, in the same fissure. حتّى يصل الكىّ الى عمق الشقاق
Then you treat it with cerate until it heals, God willing.
Chapter nineteen on cauterizing fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears in the gums' origin or in the palate or in the roots of the molars. ثمّ قاح وانفجر وصار من جرى القيح ناصور
And do that once or twice.
Then treat it afterward with what we mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops, and it heals. وإلّا فلا بدّ من الكشف على المكان وينزع العظم الفاسد على حسب ما سيأتى فى بابه إن شاء اللّه
Chapter twenty on cauterizing the molars and the relaxed gums.
If the gums are loose due to moisture and the molars are loose, and you have treated them with medicines and they have not been effective, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you place the tube on the tooth and insert the hot cautery iron into it quickly and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. ثّم ترفع يدك
Then repeat the cautery as many times as you want.
Then the patient fills his mouth with salt water and holds it for an hour and then spits it out.
For the loose tooth will be fixed, and the loose gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter twenty-one on cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with ghee or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with ghee is done by taking cow ghee and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the tip of a probe, then dipping it in the boiling ghee and placing it quickly on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools, and repeating this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold ghee and place it on the aching tooth and place the heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a copper or iron tube that is somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then, heat the cauterizing iron, the image of which is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand steady until the iron cools. Repeat this several times and the pain will go away, either that same day or the next.
After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good ghee, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.
And this is the image of the cauterizing iron:
Cauterize with whichever end you wish and according to what is possible.
And this is a picture of the tube:
Chapter twenty-two on cauterizing pigs.
If the swellings are due to phlegm and cold humors, ولم تكن تنقاد للنضج بالأدوية
Perforated at both ends so that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization.
Place it, protected, on the tumor itself once or twice if needed, until you reach the depth of the tumor.
If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton dipped in fat on it until what was burned by the fire disappears.
Then treat it with the ointment and wicks until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three on cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If moistures prevail over the trachea, especially if that is with a cold temperament, then the sick person should first vomit using laxative medications.
Then cauterize him with a cautery in the pit of the jugular vein at the base of the larynx in the low place, but be careful not to reach the larynx with the cautery, and do not burn more than half of the skin.
Then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the last vertebra of it, intensely, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four on cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the breasts, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped in the form that has been previously described.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be by spotting with the cautery iron that is called "the point," and its form has been previously described in the spotting for earache, and the spots should be from thirty spots to about that number.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he recovers.
And a cautery iron with three prongs may be made in this form, and cauterization is hastened with it because you cauterize three cauterizations with it at once.
Chapter Twenty-Five on Cauterizing the Armpit
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when it is reduced from its dislocation until it becomes habitual for it to be reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement, as we have witnessed it, فينبغى أن يردّ الفكّ اوّلا
Then heat the cautery with two skewers, whose image is this:
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side. ويأتى شكل الكىّ أربع كيّات.
And it may be cauterized with a cautery iron having three blades, so the shape of the cauterization then will be six cauterizations.
And the blades should be of the thinness of a file.
And this is a picture of the cautery iron with three blades:
And one may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight.
Then the crushed colocynth is applied to the cauterization with salt. ثمّ تلزم العليل الدعة ولا يحرّك العضو زمانا حتّى يقوى
And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cauterization or many cauterizations by dripping/dotting.
For the joint will strengthen, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.
Chapter twenty-six on cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and many humors until it puts it out of its temperament, and the fluxes to it increase, and it is treated with various kinds of treatment, but it is not effective فينبغى أن يستلقى العليل على ظهره ويمدّ ساقيه ويديه
and let the depth of the cauterization be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
and let the shape of the cauterizations be according to this image and according to this amount, without any addition
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach in this manner:
And the cautery iron with which this single cauterization is performed will be in the shape of a circle in this form:
And the stomach may be cauterized by spotting, for those who are afraid of this cauterization.
And it is that you mark spots on the stomach in the amount you want, with ink. ثمّ تكويه بمكواة نقطيّة
Then you treat it with the treatment mentioned previously, until he recovers.
Chapter twenty-seven on cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain arises in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from intense wind, to the point that it departs excessively from its natural temperament, وعولج العليل بما ذكرنا فى التقسيم فلم ينجع ذلك
On the liver, below the ribs, where the human elbow ends, it should be after each cauterization, with the distance between cauterizations being the thickness of a finger. ويكون الكىّ على طول البدن مستقيما.
And do not clench your hand with the cautery iron, gently.
And let the amount you burn of the skin's thickness be half of it, no more. ويكون العليل قائما على قدميه.
But if he is not standing, then he should be lying down, having extended his legs and raised his arms.
And this is the image of the cautery iron:
And you can cauterize these cauterizations with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft.
And be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning all the skin, so that you burn the abdomen and reach the intestines. فإنّ الجلد هناك رقيق فاعلمه،
Chapter twenty-eight on treating liver swelling with cauterization.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you want to know whether that swelling is in the liver's parenchyma or in its membrane, then if it is in the parenchyma, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there will be intense sharpness with the pain. ورأيت أنّه قد أعيا الأطبّاء علاجه فينبغى أن يستلقى العليل على قفاه
And I have seen that its treatment has baffled physicians, so the patient should lie on his back. ثمّ تعلّم على الموضع الوارم بالمداد
Then heat the cautery iron in the fire, and it is the cautery iron that resembles the probe, and this is its image: وتكويه بها كيّة واحدة حتّى تحرق الجلد كلّه.
Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by someone who has long training in the art of medicine and has treated these diseases with experience repeatedly.
Only then should he undertake such a procedure.
And leaving it (untreated) in my opinion is better.
Chapter twenty-nine on cauterizing hemorrhoids.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with birthwort roots for cold quinsy in this manner. وهوأن تأخذ من أصول الزراوند اليابس الطويل أصلا واحدا أطول ما تجد منه ويكون كغلظ الأصبع ثمّ تغمسه فى الزيت وتقده فى النار ثمّ تكويه كيّة واحدة فيما بين اتّصال الترقوة بالعنق.
And two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs. وكيّتين ايضا فيما بين الضلع الخامس والسادس مائلة الى خلف قليلا.
And it is not appropriate to deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burning.
And some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, like a probe, and heat it up, and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself, and extract the pus as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors.
And in this recklessness with cautery is a great risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that has no cure.
Chapter Thirty on Cauterizing the Spleen
If you treat a disease of the spleen with the treatment we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterizing it has three aspects, all of which are correct, one of which is to cauterize it three or four cauterizations aligned along the length of the spleen, in the form of liver cauterizations, whose form we presented previously, and the space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger or slightly more, and the character of the cautery iron is the same character that we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, and do not deepen your hand with the cautery, and the image of the sick person is lying on his back.
And the other aspect is in the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the elbow of the sick person ends, the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the left elbow of the sick person ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body, then you insert the two skewers, very protected, until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then you remove the cautery iron, so the cauterizations are four.
And if you wish to cauterize with the other cautery iron, which has three skewers, then treat the cauterized area after you leave it to drain pus for many days, then it is more effective than all of what preceded from the treatment.
Chapter thirty-one on cauterizing ascites.
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascites due to an obstruction.
If you treat the patient with ascites with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel, one cauterization on the stomach, another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one facing his chest and the other facing his stomach. ويكون قدر عمق الكىّ قريبا من ثخن الجلد،
Then you leave the cauterization open, letting the pus flow for a long time.
And do not neglect treating the patient after the cauterization with what is appropriate to combine for him the two meanings, so that healing will quickly come to him.
And the shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its image was presented previously, and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two on cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in ascites and are filled with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger. وأقم يدك بالمكواة ولا تعوّجها
Then lift your hand and do not return it at all. فإنّه يرشح الماء الأصفر
And the cautery iron should be of this form:
Then cauterize on the legs, two spots, two spots on each leg. ويكون الكىّ بالطرف السكّينّى من المكواة.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that water seeps from it.
Then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter thirty-three on cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and humors, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments, but has not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cautery and having sufficient strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as mentioned previously in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cautery on the coccyx above the buttocks, or two cauteries.
If you see that the humors are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubis and a cautery on each flank, and perhaps you may add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four on cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many or one chronic hemorrhoid in the anus, and it is from thick cold humors or corrupt moistures, and it was treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment did not work فاكو العليل ثلاث كيّات على أسفل خرز الظهر تحت المائدة قليلا مثلّثة
And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see his face swollen فاكوه على المعدة كيّة كبيرة على ما تقدّم
and leave the cauterization open for a while ثمّ عالجه حتّى يبرأ إن شاء الله
Chapter thirty-five on cauterizing warts after cutting them.
If you cut the wart, heat the cautery iron that resembles the probe. ثمّ أدخلها حامية فى نفس الثؤلول المقطوع
Do this once or twice.
If the warts are many, cauterize each one as we have described. ثمّ عالجها بما يوافقها من المراهم حتّى تبرأ
And if you cauterize it also with a large cauterization on cotton, it would be more effective in benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Six on Cauterizing the Fistula that Occurs in the Anus and its Surroundings
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, then perhaps he will recover with cauterization.
So if a fistula occurs in someone and becomes chronic, pus and corrupted fluids flow from it, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe. ثمّ اعرف قدر غوره بالمسبار
Then heat the cauterizing iron that resembles the probe. ثم أدخلها حامية فى نفس الناصور على استقامة غور الناصور والقدر الذى دخل فيه المسبار
And repeat the cauterization until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once or twice or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein.
And if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And you only do that if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you estimate that it is not perforated.
Then treat the area until it heals.
If the area seals and the discharge stops from it and remains so for a while, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the discharge does not stop from it, then know that it is perforated or there is a corrupted bone in its depth, or something similar to that, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter thirty-seven on cauterizing the kidneys.
If there occurs in the kidneys pain from cold or thick wind, and because of that the sick person's intercourse diminishes فينبغى أن تكويه على المتنين على نفس الكلى كيّة على كلّ كلية بالمكواة المسماريّة التى تقدّم ذكرها
And perhaps we cauterize him a third time at the same sitting, resulting in three cauterizations lined up, so it is more effective in benefit.
Chapter thirty-eight on cauterizing the bladder.
If there occurs in the bladder weakness and laxity from cold and humors, so that the sick person cannot hold their urine فاكوه كيّة فى أسفل السرّة على المثانة حيث يبتدئ شعر العانة
and cauterize him with a cautery in the lower back or two cauteries if there is need for that
and let the cautery instrument be nail-shaped, as mentioned previously.
Chapter thirty-nine on cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance of coldness and humidities occurs in the uterus, it thereby prevents pregnancy. وفسد طثمها وتعذّر دروره
And the cautery iron should be nail-shaped.
Chapter forty on cauterizing hip dislocation.
Erroneous/Harmful humors may flow to the hip joint, causing it to be dislocated.
And its sign is that one leg becomes longer than the other when you compare them to each other. وتجد موضع الخلع فيه فراغ.
It is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cautery after marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle.
And use the cautery whose image is presented in stomach cauterization.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it three times with the large olive-shaped cautery.
And make the depth of the cauterization equal to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter forty-one on cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and humidity, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment was not successful, and this becomes chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with habb al-muntin (asafoetida) or habb al-sabari (aloe vera) and the like. ثمّ اكوه
And the method of cauterization in it is of two types. إمّا كىّ بالأدوية المحرقة وإمّا كىّ بالنار
And cauterization with fire is of many types.
One of them is that you cauterize on the hip joint itself three triangular cauterizations in this manner: وتصير لها عمقا صالحا ويكون بعد ما بين كلّ كيّة وكيّة على قدر غلظ الأصبع وتكون المكواة زيتونيّة
A cauterization may also be performed in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circle that was previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation, a single cauterization, so that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin.
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize it with two cauterizations on the thigh, on the location where the patient indicates the pain, and one cauterization above the ankle by four fingers, slightly to the lateral side, and the cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize it where he indicates, with the point cautery, three or four times, or more if needed.
And if he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with a single knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach the point of burning a nerve or a major artery, thus causing the patient a serious injury or chronic illness.
I have seen one and another of those who were cauterized above the ankle, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became infected until the infection reached the foot, and it became perforated entirely, and the entire leg was ruined, then diarrhea occurred, and death followed.
If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in this same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization for the hip, whose description is as follows: A cup-like object is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it is about the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup is another cup, and a third cup, and the distance between each two cups is about the length of a thumb joint, and the cups are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two thumb joints, and a handle of iron is made for them, firmly attached to the cups, and this is its image:
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks. ثمّ توضع على حقّ الورك والعليل متّكئ على الجانب الصحيح
Then leave him for three days and dress it with ghee. وتترك الجرح مفتوحا أيّاما كثيرة
The author of this book said: This type of cauterization we rarely use because of its ugliness and the dreadfulness of its appearance.
And because of the scarcity of those we find who can bear it, except that it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and its proper place is affected.
As for cauterization with burning medications, it is that you make two cups, similar to the rings into which the bolt of the door descends, of copper or iron.
Let there be on their edge a height of about two knuckles or so. ويكون بعد ما بينهما قدر غلظ الأصبع
Then you apply it directly to the hip, with the patient lying on his unaffected side, and you clench your hand well. Then you pour between the two circles some of the corrosive water, which has been slightly warmed by the fire, and you hold it there for the duration of an hourglass. The patient should endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire until the stinging subsides. Then you lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the corrosive water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then you leave it for three days and apply ghee to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. And you leave it for some days while pus flows from it, for this is most effective for the benefit. Then you treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, you make a mold for it to hold the water, just as you did with the hip.
And this is the description of the corrosive water, which I have already recorded in the treatise on the Rectification of Medicines. تأخذ من ملح القلى ومن الجير غير مطفأ من كلّ واحد جزءا فتسحقهما وتضعهما فى قدر جديدة قد ثقبت أسفلها ثقبة واحدة صغيرة على قدر ما يدخلها المرود وتضع تحت قاع القدر قدرا أخرى مزجّجة وتلقى على القلى والجير من الماء العذب ما يغمرهما بأصبع بعد أن تزمّهما بيدك زمّا جيّدا وتترك القدر حتّى ينزل الماء الحادّ فى أسفل القدر المزحّجة ثمّ تجمع ذلك الماء كلّه ثمّ تلقيه على جير آخر وقلى آخر مجدّدين ايضا فإنّه يكون حينئذ قوىّ الحدّة جدّا يتصرّف فى كثير من أعمال الطبّ وفى كىّ سائر الأعضاء لأنّه يفعل فعل النار بعينها،
Among the medications that can also be used to cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of jujube, and lime with soap, ground together.
Galen related a story from an ancient man about a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and he greatly praised it, claiming that no other treatment was needed and that it heals in one go. He even said that sometimes the person entered the bath carried and came out cured. The treatment is that green spurge is taken, and if green is not available, then recently dried spurge is taken. It is finely ground with some fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh. It is bandaged and left for about three hours, or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside. Then he is taken to the bath, and when his body sweats, he is put in the basin. The pain will go away, and he will be cured, God willing.
If he is not cured, then repeat the poultice after ten days, and he will be cured, God willing.
Know that cauterization with these medicines should not be used except after purging the body.
Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if used for cauterization of sciatica, is beneficial for it, and the cauterization is done in the following manner.
Wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung and ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember. Then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then take another piece. You continue doing this until the sensation reaches the hip through the upper arm, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.
The forty-second chapter on cauterizing back pain.
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, or the like.
And it happens from the outpouring of a cold, moist humor.
And cauterization is only applied in this category alone, which results from the outpouring of a cold humor.
Therefore, it is necessary, after the patient vomits with حبّ المنتن (habb al-muntin) or similar, to cauterize his back where the pain is, in three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the place with ink, in each row five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
And the cauterization should be with a point cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize him three or four cauterizations with a medium nail-shaped cautery, in this manner:
The thirty-third chapter on cauterizing the beginning of humpbackedness.
This ailment frequently affects young children.
And the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and moving. وتجد فى آخِر فقارات ظهره خرزة قد برزت تنتو على سائر الخرزات
So if you see that and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery iron that is circular in this way: لتأخذ الكيّة على كلّ جهة من الفقارة باستواء
And if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with the point cautery, two or three rows. ولتكن النقط قريبة بعضها من بعض
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
And be careful to use the cautery in the hump that results from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter forty-four on cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors flowing to any part of the body فإذا حدثت الأوجاع فى الرجلين فمن عادة الأطبّاء أن يسمّوا ذلك نقرسا خاصّة
So if cold-caused gout is treated with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.
And that is to cauterize it after emptying (purgation) around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations.
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized in this way:
And if you need to cauterize the face of the man, do it with the cautery iron for spotting. فإن صعدت الأوجاع الى الركبتين او الى سائر المفاصل وكثيرا ما يعرض ذلك فاكوه على كلّ ركبة ثلاث كيّات او اربعا من كلّ جهة بهذه المكواة الزيتونيّة بعينها
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize him, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If the pains rise to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you go around two rows.
If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them on each knuckle a spot and on the back of the hand.
If the pains rise after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize them on each side.
And the sick person should not be without good management and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and vomits the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five on cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and omentum descend to the testicle, and this is recent and new, فينبغى أن تأمر العليل بترك الأكل يومه وأن يستعمل من المليّنات ما يحدر به البراز عن جوفه
Then he should lie down on his back in front of you and you order him to hold his breath until the omentum or intestines protrude. ثم تردّه بأصبعك
Then you mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat a cautery, its shape being this:
Until it becomes white and emits sparks. ثمّ تردّ المعاء او الثرب الى جوفه
And the patient's legs have been spread apart, and a pillow has been placed under him. وخادم آخر يعقد على ساقيه وآخر على صدره يمسك يديه
Then apply the cautery iron to the mark itself. ويدك بالمكواة واقفة مستقيمة وتمسكها حتّى تبلغ بها العظم
And be very careful of the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, so that you do not burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great affliction.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.
And the cautery iron for children should be gentle, according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with ghee until the char of the fire disappears.
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to make his food, for the duration of his treatment, something that softens his stomach so that the intestine does not protrude during straining and defecation.
Then, if he wants to get up after the forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.
And reduce exertion, and fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if he follows this regimen in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing.
And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.
As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you want it not to increase, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size. وليكن ما تحرق من الجلد مثل ثلثيه
And some of the predecessors have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this manner:
After you have marked the hernia with ink, وتصير الخطّ الذى بالعرض فى الجانب الأعلى من الفتق والخطّ الآخر الى اسفل
and the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six on cauterizing the uvula.
If pain occurs in some organs due to a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts for a long time, and treatment with medications is not effective
then it should be cauterized with a point cautery, and the cauterization of each organ should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, strength, and the severity and chronicity of the pain.
If it heals from the first cauterization, then fine, otherwise, repeat the cauterization because it is the nature of these pains to move from the organ to what is near it. فينبغى أن تتبعها بالكّى حتّى يبرأ العليل
Chapter forty-seven on cauterizing leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially a certain type. الجذام الذى يكون من قبل تعفّن البلغم والسوداء
So if you want to cauterize it, examine it; if the leprosy is in its early stages, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the section on classification, and it has not worsened or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's entire temperament, then cauterize him on the head with five burns: one in the customary center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one from behind on the hollow of the nape of the neck. Press your hand firmly with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly, and scales come off it, to facilitate the exhalation of the thick vapors from it. And also cauterize him on the spleen itself, as mentioned before.
But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has manifested clearly, then it is advisable to cauterize him with these burns that we mentioned on the head, a burn on the tip of the nose, two burns on the cheeks, two burns on the cervical vertebrae, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, another above it on the same area, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the nipples of the chest. And cauterize him on every joint of the fingers of his hands and feet with a burn, and on each heel of his feet and ulna of his hands, and be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.
He may also be cauterized with a burn on the pubic bone, another on the cardia of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you cauterize, the more beneficial and effective it is.
And know that the sick person does not feel pain from cauterization as a healthy person does, because his body is numb.
The cauteries should be of a size appropriate for the organs and joints, according to the descriptions of the irons that have been given.
Then treat the cauterization with powdered chickpea flour mixed with honey and other treatments until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight on cauterizing numbness.
When a limb is numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal فاكو نفس العضو المنخدر بكيّات على حسب ما يستحقّ عظم العضو او صغره
And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin. ثمّ تعالجه بالمرهم حتّى يبرأ
And some numbness that affects the hand and foot may be cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, so the numbness goes away.
And no one should undertake this except someone who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine on cauterizing vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical remedy works for it فأكو عليه كيّا فيه عمق قليلا على قدر ثخن الجلد
then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, plantain leaves, and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each ويخلط الجميع ويطلى على خرقة ويلزم الموضع حتّى يبرأ
Chapter fifty on cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around it as it rotates.
Some physicians have mentioned that it should be cauterized with a deep cautery in its center, but I do not see that because I expect it to ulcerate. وقد شاهدت ذلك مرّات
So the correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one on cauterizing the furuncle.
If a furuncle occurs in someone and it is slow to ripen, either because of the agent causing it, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and has little blood, or because of the time, وأردت أن تسرع فى نضج الدبيلة فاكو حواليها بكيّات صغار كثيرة تنقيطا
If you want to treat it with cauterization, then heat the iron which has this shape:
And insert it in the middle of the furuncle until it penetrates the skin.
And let the cautery be from what is below so that the flow of pus is facilitated.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two on cauterizing the corroding ulcer.
The corroding ulcer is but a corruption that spreads in the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see the corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [it is fine]; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
The corroding ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication, as it acts as a quicker substitute for fire.
I have mentioned its treatment with the potent medication in the classification, so take it from there whenever you need it.
Chapter fifty-three on cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This ailment frequently occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man.
Cauterization for it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is that you heat the hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail on all sides, and it has a thin edge, then you place it hot on the nail, then you rotate your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail, and you leave it for three days while it suppurates, then you dress it with wild mallow pounded with salt, and you leave the dressing on it for a night, then it will be uprooted, then you treat the site of the wound with the ointment that generates flesh until it heals.
If the nails are not inverted, and they frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should take a tube of copper or of iron or of eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then you pour into the tube a small amount of strong water, and you hold your hand while rotating it with a slight pinch of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the strong water finds a way to penetrate to the base of the nail, and the patient bears the sting of the strong water for a short time, then you leave it, then the nail will be uprooted.
Thus, you do to them one by one until you have treated all of them in the body, then you treat their places after they are uprooted with what generates flesh from ointments.
Chapter fifty-four on cauterizing tremors.
If someone experiences tremors due to coldness in the nerves or from quartan fever or other causes فينبغى أن تكويه أربع كيّات او خمسا على خرز الظهر بين كلّ خرزة كيّة
for the tremors will cease and it accelerates the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter fifty-five on cauterizing pustules occurring on the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, arising from cold, thick, and corrupt humors.
Therefore, upon their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with an aloeswood stick, the tip of which has been ignited by fire, or with the root of long birthwort, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
Carbuncles may also be cauterized in the same manner upon their first appearance, so that they do not increase, and the causative excess dissipates, and the patient recovers.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has been evacuated by bloodletting.
Chapter fifty-six on cauterizing bleeding occurring when an artery is severed.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing an organ, and so on, making it difficult to stop.
So if this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the opening of the artery and press firmly until the blood is trapped beneath your finger and nothing comes out.
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and apply the cautery to the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops, taking care not to burn a nerve that might be there, thus causing the patient further harm.
Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we have said, or by severing it if it has not already been severed, for if it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop, or by tying it tightly with threads, or by applying medications that stop bleeding and applying tight bandages.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage, or by tightening it with rags, or by applying burning substances, and so on, it will not stop at all by that, except rarely.
If this happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine present, he should immediately place his index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described, and press very firmly until the blood is contained and comes out from above the wound, and he should continually apply very cold water to the artery and finger, without removing it, until the blood clots, thickens, and stops flowing.
Meanwhile, consider what cauterization or medication he needs.
The second chapter on incision, lancing, phlebotomy, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicine, its causes and reasons, its instruments, and forms of cauteries, and I have made that into chapters from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same path to make it easy for the student to obtain what he seeks.
And before I begin with that, it is necessary for you to know, my sons, that this chapter contains more danger than the first chapter on cauterization, and for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the work in this chapter often involves the discharge of blood, by which life is sustained, when opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar things, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful for you, for various types of people may come to you in this profession with various kinds of illnesses, and among them are those who have become weary of their illness, and death has become insignificant to them due to the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and the illness has reached a stage that indicates death.
And among them are those who offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for health, but their illness is fatal, so it is not appropriate for you to help anyone who comes to you with such a condition at all, and let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that until after certain knowledge is established with you regarding the good outcome it will lead to.
And use in all the treatment of your patients the precedence of knowledge and warning about what the safety will lead to, for in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks.
May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success. Indeed, that is in His hand, there is no god but Him.
And I have arranged this chapter into sections, as presented in the chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, to make it easier for you to obtain what you want from it, God willing.
The first chapter on the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs to boys at birth if the midwife squeezes the boy's head without gentleness.
It may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than boys. وجميع من رأيت منهم أسرع اليه الموت
And I have certainly seen among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until the boy could not sit up on his own due to the size of his head. والرطوبة تتزايد حتّى هلك
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the periosteum.
And the treatment for that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, it is necessary to make one horizontal incision in the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two knuckles so that the moisture flows out.
And this is a picture of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make it two intersecting incisions in this way:
And if the moisture is under the bone وعلامته أن ترى خياطات الرأس مفتوحة من كلّ جهة
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out. ثمّ تشدّ الشقوق بالخرق والرفائد
Then the bandage is loosened, and the wound is treated with bandages and ointments.
And do not neglect to tighten the head moderately. وتغذّى العليل بكلّ غذاء جافّ قليل الرطوبة الى أن يقوى العضو ويبرأ
Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appear.
Because it may be more in the back of the head or in the front of it, or on the right or on the left.
So you aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appeared to you. فتشقّه على ما يمكنك
And be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient dies from that bleeding with the discharge of moisture.
The second chapter on cutting the two arteries that are behind the ears, known as the throbbing arteries.
When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or chest, and this becomes chronic, and medication does not work, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, if you intend to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the excess of his garment, then look where the vein pulsates, and their locations are the two lowered places behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people, then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, you can insert the scalpel from under the artery and lift it upwards while cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers, because when the vein is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward in successive spurts.
If the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you should measure from the ear a distance of about three fingers, then mark it with ink and incise down to the bone.
It is advisable to let out six ounces of blood on average, and sometimes you may let out more or less, all depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries as it appears to you.
Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that a hot swelling does not occur, then tie the wound with a wick of linen cloth, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
The third chapter on the consumption/inflammation of the two arteries which are in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraine or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and is treated with various medical treatments, but that does not work فقد جرّبنا فى هذه الأمراض سلّ الشريانات من الأصداغ او كيّها كما وصفنا
And the way to incise them is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the temples وتقصد الشريان الظاهر فى الصدغ فإنّه يتبيّن لك من نبضه
If it is hidden from you, then let the patient tighten his neck with the extra part of his garment. ثمّ تحكّ أنت الموضع بخرقة او تكمّد الموضع بماء حارّ حتّى يظهر الشريان ظهورا بيّنا واضحا
If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. ثمّ تقطع منه جزءا على قدر ما يتباعد طرفاه وتنقبض ولا تحدث نزفا
Then let out blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread. وليكن الخيط إمّا من ابريسم وإما من أوتار العود لئلّا يسرع اليه العفن قبل التحام الجرح فيحدث النزف
Then cut the excess between the two ligatures. تفعل ذلك فى تلك الساعة او بعد وقت آخر
And if you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are severed, which will serve the same purpose, or better, as we have said.
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization helps to destroy moisture, so it is more effective in benefit.
It is necessary after severing the arteries to stuff the place with worn cotton and place tight bandages on it.
And after the resolution, treat it with dry medicines that grow flesh and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, immediately cut it either by cauterization وإمّا أن تملأ الموضع بالزاج وتشدّ يدك حتّى ينقطع الدم
And what is lighter and easier than severing the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink and applying it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vessel is cut in two places so that the space between its ends widens. فإنّه لا يلتحم بهذا الكىّ البتّة
And this is the image of the cautery:
The sharpness of the two knives resembles the two small intestines, except that they are much less sharp than the knife, because if they were as sharp as the knife, the cold would reach them faster and the meat would not be cut quickly.
So if there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will be retained in them, and they will cut the meat quickly.
And this method is better than any other method, lighter, and easier.
And let the distance between the two knives be the thickness of a finger.
The fourth chapter on the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins that are on the skull from the outside, and there is no benefit from any medical treatment with medicines ورأيت وجه العليل قد احمّر ويحسّ فى جبينه دبيبا كدبيب النمل وعيناه مهزولتان رطبتان قد تأكّلت اشفارهما وتشبّطت اجفانهما من حدّة الدموع
which is that you order the patient to shave the hair that is on his forehead, then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers الشقّ الواحد موازيا لطول الأنف فى وسط الجبهة والثانى على البعد قليلا من حركة العضل الذى فى الصدغ والثالث من الجهة الأخرى
and beware of cutting the two arteries that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws ويكون بعد كلّ شقّ قدر ثلاث اصابع مضمومة
and let there be with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry rags with which you dry the blood
then you insert the double-edged scalpel, which is this image of it من الشقّ الذى يلى الصدغ الى الشقّ الأوسط وتسلخ به جميع الجلد الذى فيما بين الشقّين مع الصفاق الذى على العظم
And its sharp side is placed upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone. وتدفعها حتّى تنتهى الى الشقّ الأوسط وتقطع بها جميع الأوعية التى تنزل من الرأس الى العينين من غير أن يصل القطع الى ظاهر الجلد
Then you do the same in the middle incision to the other incision.
And after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the areas of the solidified blood clots.
Then you put a wick of cotton dipped in wine and oil or vinegar and oil in each incision. لئلّا يحدث ورم حارّ
And on the third day you loosen the bandage and use frequent washing with lukewarm water. ثمّ تعالجه بمرهم الباسليقون بدهن الورد وسائر ما تعالج به الجراحات الى أن يبرأ إن شاء الله
The fifth chapter on the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences numerous, severe, sharp, and persistent episodes of nasal discharge, and their eyes appear sunken and small, with weakened vision, ulcerated eyelids, and loss of eyelashes, accompanied by a sharp, painful headache deep within the head and continuous sneezing, فاعلم من هذه الأعراض أنّ تلك الموادّ والنزلات إنّما تجىء من عروق كثيرة عميقة وأفضل العلاج فيها هذا العلاج،
Order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly higher horizontally, starting the incision from the left temple to the right temple, reaching the bone. Keep your hand away from the temple muscles that move during chewing until the bone is exposed. Dry all the blood with a sponge, then separate the edges of the incision with worn cotton or a twisted piece of linen. Then bandage it from above with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent the formation of a hot swelling.
When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow. Then treat it with a drying remedy that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
The sixth chapter on the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone or something like stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas and kernels, and so on; or a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and so on; or an animal.
When a pebble or something like a pebble, which does not grow in the ear, falls into the ear, face the ear towards the sun. If you see the pebble, drop in it a bit of violet oil or candle wax, then try to remove it by moving the head or by sneezing with hellebore, blocking the nostrils when the sneeze comes, after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upwards; often it comes out with this treatment.
If it doesn't come out, then try to remove it with the gentle instrument which is pictured here:
If it comes out with the husk, fine, otherwise try to extract it with a smooth, blunt hook with little curvature.
If it doesn't come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube gently into the ear hole. وسدّ ما حوالى الأنبوبة بالقير المليّن بالدهن لئلّا يكون للريح طريق غير الأنبوبة
If it doesn't come out with what we described, then take a small amount of gum arabic or processed gum, which is used for catching birds. فضعه فى طرف المرود بعد أن تلفّ عليه قطنة محكمة
If it doesn't come out with all that we described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling occurs or it becomes tense.
The method of incision is to first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein and draw blood according to his strength. ثمّ تجلس العليل بين يديك وتقلب أذنه الى فوق وتشقّ شقّا صغيرا فى أصل الأذن عند شحمته فى الموضع المنخفض منها
Then stitch the incision immediately quickly and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that swell and expand, try to extract it with what we mentioned.
If it doesn't come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this: وحاول به قطع ذلك النوع من الحبوب الساقطة فى الأذن
And you only do that if you are certain that that grain has been moistened by the ear’s vapor until it becomes many small pieces.
Then you extract it with the blind hook, or with soft date fibers, or by sucking, as we mentioned. فإنّه يسهل إخراجها
As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore. وقد ملأ أذنه بشىء من القطن البالى وهو مضطجع على تلك الأذن التى فيها الماء
If it comes out with that, fine; otherwise, take many pebbles the length of fingers, thin and smooth. فتدفّئها بالنار قليلا
The water may also come out by taking one papyrus reed or feather. ويدخل طرفها الواحد فى الأذن
Or you can draw it out with the tube in the way that was described with the pebble.
As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, observe: if it is small-bodied like a flea or similar, treat it with what I mentioned in the section.
But if its body is large, perceptible to the senses, try to extract it with date fibers and hooks. وأمره أسهل من جميع ما ينشب فى الأذن
As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you treated it with what we mentioned in the section on ear drops and your treatment was not successful, فينبغى أن تنظر الى الأذن فى الشمس فإن ظهر اليك شىء من الدود فأخرجه بالجفت او بالصنانير اللطاف
If none appear to you, then take a tube; this is its form: ضيقة الأسفل واسعة الأعلى
If it doesn't come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If it doesn't come out with what we mentioned, use the ear drops that I mentioned. وقد جرّبتها الأوائل فى قتل الدود
And your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear will be with this instrument. وهده صورتها:
And if you wish, the nozzle that is inside the tube can be made of well-wrought copper. وإن شئت أخذت مرودا ولففت فى طرفه قطنة لفّا محكما ثمّ تلقى الدهن او العصارة او ما تريد من هذه الأدوية فى الأنبوبة وهى فى الأذن ثمّ تدخل المرود بالقطنة من فوق وتعصر به يدك عصرا معتدلا حتّى يندفع الدهن فى جوف السمع ويحسّ به العليل داخلا.
And let what you pour into the ear be slightly warmed by the fire. واحذر ن يكون الشىء الذى يقطّر فيها باردا جدّا او حارّا جدّا فإنّ الأذن لا تحتمل ذلك،
Chapter seven on the treatment of sudden blockage of the ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the pores of their ears not perforated.
Also, some people may experience a blockage in the ear canal due to an injury or flesh growing in it.
This blockage may be in the depth of the ear hole, imperceptible to sight. وقد يعرض الى خارج الثقب قليلا ويدركه البصر.
So the one that appears in the depth of the ear and is not perceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to see.
And the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look into it. فإن رأيت السدّ ظاهرا فافتحه بمبضع لطيف تكون هذه صورته:
Its tip should have some slight, limited width, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear.
If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with the patient's experience of hearing difficulty, rub it gently with the probe, being careful not to injure the eardrum. Then, place a wick in the ear, sized according to the width of the opening, having coated it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up.
Or, take a wick, moisten it in water, sprinkle powdered vitriol on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have coated in a cerate made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then continue treating it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding, as mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.
The eighth chapter on the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist and may be dry.
It is necessary to grasp them with tweezers or a hook and cut them with a scalpel from their roots. ثّم تحمل على الموضع زاجا مسحوقا،
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle lenticular cautery iron.
And cauterizing it is better after cutting. وكثيرا ما تعود اذا بقى من أصولها شىء.
Chapter nine on the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Often, something appears in the eyelids that resembles hail in its intensity and hardness, and therefore it is called hail.
It is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The procedure for it is that you look, and if the hailstone is prominent on the outer surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, then its treatment is easy.
Make a horizontal incision on it, then gently peel it from each side until it is freed, then hook it with a fishhook and cut it off.
And if you are unable to cut it off unless after piercing through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm the patient at all.
If the incision is large, then close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm in it for you, because the ointment will strengthen it and heal it.
If the hailstone is tilted towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and hook the hailstone with a fishhook without needing an incision, and cut it off from each side.
If it pierces through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm at all.
Then, after cutting off the hailstone, wash the eye with salt water and treat the area with something that heals until the patient recovers.
The tenth chapter on the treatment of sharanaq that appears in the eyelid.
A sharnaq is a small lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it occurs most often in children, making their eyes heavy and causing them to experience colds in the early mornings.
They are unable to look at sunlight because tears quickly come to their eyes, and so you see them constantly leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the protrusion of the sharnaq is visible. ومتى كبّست الموضع بأصابعك أحسست بالشرناق بينهما.
The procedure is to place the patient's head in your lap, then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the sharnaq from all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the sharnaq in the center of the circle, then make a horizontal incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made for bloodletting.
As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the sharnaq, and in most cases the sharnaq will protrude from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat, so pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers while turning your hand right and left until it is completely removed.
Beware of increasing the size of the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the sharnaq does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then you should increase the incision slightly and gently until the sharnaq appears, then pull it out as we mentioned.
Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it with a soft dressing.
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals.
If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter eleven on the types of twitching of the eye.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid in an unnatural way under the natural eyelashes and persist, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickness, until this becomes a cause of blindness.
Lifting the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. وإمّا أن يكون التشمير بالقطع والخياطة او بالقصب على ما أنا ذاكره
You should put the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns over, then fine, otherwise insert a needle with a thread from the bottom of the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself, and pull the thread up with the eyelid and turn it over with the probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid below the extra hair with the lancet, from the larger corner to the smaller corner, then remove the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid with ink a shape like a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be as much as you want to lift the eyelid, because people may differ in this; some need to cut from the eyelid a suitable amount according to how much the eyelid has relaxed, and some need to cut less; all of this depends on the degree of relaxation of the eyelid.
Then you make an incision with the scalpel on the two lines that you marked, and start from the larger corner to the smaller corner, and one incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the probe, then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off, then join the two edges by stitching with a needle and thin wool thread, and wipe the blood and stick the remaining threads on the eyebrows with some sticky substance if you want to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter.
Then leave the stitching and the threads for about three or four days, then treat it.
If you wish, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound closes and joins, and stitching is better.
This method of lifting was mentioned by the ancients, but it is a burden on the patient, although it is good work and there is no danger in it.
And another method of lifting is to mark a shape on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf as we described, then lift the eyelid with three hooks that are either separate or joined in this way.
Then you cut what remains of the eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately.
If you cannot restrain the quivering and it does not settle for you, take a needle with thread in it and insert it in the middle of the figure, insert another thread near the larger corner, and a third thread near the smaller corner, and gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then raise your hand with it moderately and lift the marked skin entirely as we have described.
Then bring the edges of the wound together by stitching and treat it until it heals; if a hot swelling appears at your cutting or incision, soothe that swelling with qayruti and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen to the lower eyelid that its lashes turn inward, so it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, stitching, cauterizing with fire and with a sharp medicine, and cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and stitching, and cutting and stitching are more effective.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this manner: you turn the eyelid and make the incision from the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a lancet, and notches are carved in their ends on both sides where the threads hold, then you bring them together gently over what remains of the eyelid and tighten the two reeds from both sides tightly and firmly and leave it for days, so the tightened skin dies, blackens, and rots until it falls off by itself, and if it is slow, cut it off with scissors, then treat it until it heals.
When it heals, the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will not prick the eye, and this is the picture of the two reeds, make it in this shape and this size in length and width precisely.
Chapter twelve on lifting the irritating hair from the eye with a needle.
If it is a hair or two, the procedure for that is to take a thin needle and insert in it a smooth, thin silk thread. ثمّ تجمع طرفيه وتعقدهما عقدة لطيفة جدّا
Then attach to the loop another thin thread, shorter than it. واعقد طرفيه إن شئت
Then have the patient place his head in your lap and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is delicate work.
Then insert the needle with the loop at the base of the extra hair and pass it quickly through the eyelid until you bring it out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the thread over the loop and insert that hair into the loop, whether it is one or two or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then put the hair back in it and pull them both. تفعل ذلك حتّى ترتفع فى الثقب الأعلى وتراها رأى العين
Then release the loop and the thread and remove them. وشدّ العين واتركها مشدودة يومين او ثلاثة حتّى تلزم الشعرة مكانها وينبت عليها اللحم
If the hair is short, then either add to it a long hair from the natural hair, so it will rise with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, then you can remove it.
Chapter thirteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The eye that is affected by this fissure is called "hare-eye".
And this fissure is either natural or accidental.
The accidental one results from the healing of a wound, a tear, a cauterization, or something similar.
The way to treat it is to incise that healed part and separate its edges and place between them a wick of linen and tie it until it heals.
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, because if you do that, the fissure will return worse than it was.
Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek and poultices with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been soaked, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear the wick with it and treat with it.
And the key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally.
And this treatment that we mentioned is only a partial repair of the fissure, not that the appearance of the place returns exactly as it was originally.
Chapter fourteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a fissure. وتكون طبيعيّة وتكون عرضيّة.
The accidental one results from a wound, a cut, cauterization, and the like.
The way to operate on it is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left corner to the right corner until the thread is at both edges of the flesh.
Then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to how it should be, then fine; otherwise, you take a small probe and place it on the location of the fissure and turn the eyelid with it, and you make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the two incisions starting from the corners of the cut you made until they meet, forming an angle so that when they join, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
And it is the letter lam in Greek.
Then you remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below what follows the eyelid. ثمّ تجمع الأجزاء المتفرّقة بخياطتين تخيطه بخيط صوف
Then you treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing medicines and twisting until it heals.
And if the eyelid split occurred from an incision or stitching or cauterization, then it is necessary to make a simple incision below the hair of the eyelashes also as mentioned before. ثمّ تفرّق بين الشفتين بفتل على ما ذكرنا
The summary of the treatment of the eyelid split, if it is from above or from below, is that you perform the work according to what is available to you from the form of the eyelid split. فإنّها قد تكون كثيرة الاختلاف فى الصورة
And the experienced craftsman manages the trick in any way possible until he restores the form to its natural state or close to it.
The disease itself will guide you to what is suitable for it in terms of work and instruments in most cases.
The fifteenth chapter is on the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient does not become anxious during the procedure and the scalpel slips and injures the eye with its sharpness.
And your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion, and wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the entire adhesion heals, then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with it, or instill in it a solution of vitriol suppositories dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick and place cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and after the third day use desiccating suppositories until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen on cutting the nail and the growth of flesh of the nail beds.
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, and it resembles a hard, thin membrane. وإمّا أن تكون غير عصبيّة تشبه رطوبة جامدة بيضاء اذا مسّها الحديد او رمت أخذها بالصنّارة تقطّعت ولم تثبت فيها صنّارة.
Both types begin from the greater canthus, and they slowly creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye.
The method of its removal is that the patient places his head in your lap, then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards. ثمّ تأخذ إبرة وتدخل فيها شعرة من شعر الخيل او البقر وخيط قوىّ وتثنى طرف الإبرة قليلا وتغرزها فى وسط الظفرة وتنفذها بالإبرة وتربط بالخيط الظفرة وتمدّها الى فوق.
Then you cut the remainder at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus, lest constant tearing result from its cutting.
And you may pull the pterygium with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then you peel with the smooth scalpel the edge which this is its picture:
And beware that the scalpel touches the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil swells.
Then, after the incision, put in the eye some powdered salt or some zinc sulfate suppositories and leave it until the next day, then treat it as needed until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you are unable to insert a needle in it, nor fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.
And if you want to excise it, open the patient's eye and take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this manner: واجرد الظفرة به من فوق جردا بلطف
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone. إلّا إن اعترضك فى العين ورم حارّ فاتركها وعالج الورم الحارّ حتّى يبرأ
Then repeat the scraping procedure on it until it heals.
As for a fleshy outgrowth of the conjunctiva, if the outgrowth harms the eye excessively, فعلّق ذلك النتو بالصنّارة واقطع منه بعضه
Then instill into the eyes red collyrium or copper sulfate collyrium until it heals.
Chapter seventeen on cutting the warding and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.
Red, overlapping flesh may grow in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or comes close to it, or overflows onto the eyelids. وربّما انقلبت الأجفان الى خارج ويشبه ورد الجلنار.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you pick up all of that red flesh with suitable small hooks, or grasp it with tweezers or forceps, then cut the flesh bit by bit until it is all gone by cutting, and be careful of the eye so as not to harm it during the procedure.
Your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors like those used to pluck hairs, as their image will appear in the chapter following this chapter.
Once your cutting is complete and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the eye from the outside to prevent hot swelling.
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with something that soothes the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals.
And likewise do the same with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type, except that you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments.
And do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate that procedure.
Chapter eighteen on dripping eye drops into the eye.
Cobwebs are red veins that are woven over the eye, preventing it from performing its function of sight.
And the eye weakens with the length of days, so it is necessary for you first to look; if the eye in which the cobwebs are is strong and there is no other disease in it other than the cobwebs, then the plucking is that you order the ill person to place his head in your lap, then hang those veins with one hook or two depending on your skill, and the hooks should be smooth in bending according to this picture:
Or it may be two double hooks in one body, in this form:
Then you gently pick up those veins with fine scissors and gently wipe away the blood from time to time until you see that those veins have disappeared from the eye and the blood has been drained.
And be careful with the eye, do not hurt it with the tips of the scissors.
And let your work be at midday, facing the sun. وتثبت فى عملك جدّا لئلّا تقطع غير تلك العروق.
When you are finished, instill in the eye the green or red suppository so that its sharpness consumes what remains of the diseased tissue.
If you cannot pick it all up at that time, then dress the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain and leave it for days until its pain subsides and you are safe from the hot swelling.
Then repeat the procedure on it in this same manner until it heals.
This is a picture of the scissors:
The basis of the procedure is that you open the eye with fixed or triangular openers, held by a skilled student, and the head of the patient is in the lap of the student, and another one dries the tears and verifies the gaze in the front of the eye and its back, and you have the choice to start the picking from the top of the eye or from its bottom.
And it's best to dry two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the corona and the other at its beginning, and hold them between the middle and index fingers.
Then hang hooks from below opposite them. ثم تمسكها بين الخنصر والبنصر
And lift your hand lightly until you see that all the strands have risen.
Cut from the smaller west, if you wish, with scissors, and if you wish, with a fine scalpel.
And insert the probe on a needle and clean all the strands until they rise over the conjunctiva.
And do not cut the dryness, because tears and blood will become difficult (liquify?) for you.
Then cut with scissors what is beyond the corona, from above and from below, so that nothing remains attached except in the cornea.
If you can lift it from the cornea by peeling with the probe, it is better.
Chapter nineteen on returning the feather to the nose.
Doctors call the fistula a fistula.
If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it except to incise the swelling when it ripens and extract all the moisture or pus in it until the bone is exposed.
So when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:
And it is called the rough-headed one, made from Indian iron, and its head is round like a button, engraved with the engraving of a file or scalpel, a fine engraving.
You place it on the site of the corruption in the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while clenching your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
And you do that repeatedly, then you dress the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If the place is sealed and flesh grows in it, and the pus flow stops and it remains for forty days, and it does not regenerate, nor fester, nor does anything happen to it, then know that it has healed, otherwise there is no solution except to return the fistula to the nose opening in this way, which is to expose the bone again with iron or with a sharp medicine. فإذا انكشف العظم فخذ مشعبا على هذه الصورة:
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, brought to a point, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself, and this should be near the suture, and keep your hand a little away from the eye. ثمّ أدر يدك بالمشعب حتّى ينفذ العظم ويحسّ به العليل بأن يجد الريح تخرج منه اذا أمسك يده على أنفه.
Then at this point, treat the area with astringent and drying medications, as I have taught you.
So when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter that was flowing outwards will return to the nose, and this will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty on Pushing Back Protrusions of the Eye
If the eye swells in its entirety, and no damage or impairment occurs in vision, then it is necessary to give the patient a laxative, then bleed him in the cephalic vein.
Then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without scarification and perform a gentle suction. ثمّ تضع على العين لطوخا صنع من أقاقيا وصبر ولبان وعنزروت
The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each rag into four folds, making many of them, then place them one on top of the other to the extent needed by the eye, then tie them firmly with a strong cloth.
And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, then it should be tightened well.
Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said.
If you see that the eye has returned to normal, then good, otherwise repeat the poultice, compresses, bandaging, and cupping until it returns to normal.
Chapter twenty-one on cutting the uvea.
If a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person's appearance. وأردت قطعها فالعمل فيها على ما أصف
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the grape-like swelling from bottom to top. ثمّ تدخل إبرة أخرى فيها خيط مثنىّ من ناحية المأق وتنفذها وتدع الإبرة الأولى على حالها
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread is folded and tie some of the swelling around the needle and tighten it well.
Then you remove the needle and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the swelling.
Then you treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
The swelling may also be tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth so that the swelling increases well.
Then it is lanced with a thin scalpel that reaches the depth of the eye, so that the watery fluid flows out and the swelling subsides and withers on the spot.
Then you tighten it until it heals.
Chapter twenty-two on the treatment of leukoderma.
This ailment, which is called 'kamana', is a duration that gathers in the eye, resembling dripping water, but it is not water.
And the way to treat this is that you sit the patient upright on a chair, then you take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the 'duration' move to the bottom of his eye, then it stabilizes and doesn't move, and the light is released, and the patient sees things as he used to see them.
And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water.
If the descent of the 'duration' is not possible by what we mentioned, then sit the patient between your hands, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the 'iklil' (limbus) until the substance comes out.  Once it comes out, instill in the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other treatments until he recovers.
Chapter twenty-three on cupping for the water that descends into the eye.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which one is suitable for the cupping glass, with detailed and explained words, so you take it from there correctly.
Then, you should sit the patient between your hands, squared facing the light near the sun, and tie his healthy eye, tightening it well.
Then you lift his eyelid with your left hand if the eye that has the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping glass near the iris, with the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, from the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping glass with force while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping glass that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent of the cupping glass's going into the depth is equal to the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the iris of the eye, for you see the copper in the eye of the observer himself, due to the clarity of the cornea.
Then you move the cupping glass upwards to the place where the water is, then you press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see whatever his sight opens upon immediately, with the cupping glass in his eye. Then he rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping glass.
And when it settles and doesn't rise, remove the cupping glass gently while twisting it with your hand little by little.
Then you dissolve in water a bit of pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then you place on the outside of the whole eye lint or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and you tie the healthy eye with it.
As for us and the people of our time, we put on it ground cumin with egg white.
If the cupping glass does not respond to you for entering the eye due to its hardness, because among people there are those whose eyes are very hard, then you should take the lancet that is called the 'barid,' which is this image:
So you pierce only the conjunctiva itself, and do not go deep in the piercing.
It is only that you tap a fine spot for the lancet, then insert the lancet as we mentioned.
And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and he refrains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food what softens his nature, and he does not move his head right or left at all, and the bandage remains as it is until the third day, then you loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision, and show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not appropriate that you do that at the time of treatment or after the lancing immediately, but it is appropriate that you avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, it is appropriate to unbind the eye before the seventh day and correct that with what calms the swelling, so that when it subsides, then you release his vision and place a veil over his face, training his vision from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then he leaves the room gradually and manages his affairs.
And know that in lancing, the learner cannot do without observation several times, then he proceeds to the work.
And it has reached me from some of the Iraqis that he mentioned that a perforated lancet is made in Iraq that sucks the water with it, and I have not seen anyone in our country do that, nor have I read it in a book of the early books, and it is possible that this is a recent innovation.
And this is a picture of types of lancets for those who are ignorant of them to understand:
It is made specifically of copper. ويكون طرفها بهذه الرقّة بعينها مثلّثة الطرف حادّة،
Chapter twenty-four on the treatment of nasal polyps.
Various excess flesh may grow in the nose, some of which resembles a scorpion with many legs.
And some of it is cancerous flesh, hardened and dark-colored.
And some of it is soft flesh, not dark-colored. So whatever of this flesh is soft, is not malignant or cancerous,
so you should sit the patient before you, facing the sun, and open his nostril, and cast the hook into that flesh, then pull it out, then cut what you reach of it with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side until you know that all the flesh is gone.
If any of it remains that you cannot cut, scrape it with one of the fine instruments gently until nothing of it remains. فإن غلبك الدم او عرض ورم حارّ فقابله بما ينبغى او كان من الأورام الخبيثة فبادر فاكوه حتّى ينقطع الدم وتذهب جميع اللحوم.
Then, after cutting, put vinegar and water or a drink into the nose. فإن انفتح الأنف وسلكت منه الرطوبة الى الحلق فاعلم أنّه قد برئ،
But if the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside him is growing flesh at the top of the spongy bones that the instrument did not reach by cutting.
At that time, it is necessary to take a somewhat thick linen thread and tie many knots in it, making the distance between each knot the length of a finger or less. ويتحيّل العليل يدسّ طرف الخيط الواحد فى أنفه بمرود او بما أمكنه بعد أن يصنعه مثل الزّر ويجذب ريحه حتّى يصل الى الخيشوم ويخرج على حلقه.
Boys in school often do such a thing, and it is easy for whoever wants to do it.
Then, bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose, then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread and, after wiping the blood, insert a wick into the nose that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh.
Then, lastly, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
If it needs a drying treatment, use that.
And this is a picture of the syringe with which oils and medicines are dripped into the nose:
He places something like a small lamp, open at its reservoir and channel, made of silver or copper.
Similarly, if you wish, you make the tube closed, like a reed, with a flat surface for the perfume oil.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil in it or what. شئت من العصارات او الأشياء السيّالة،
Chapter twenty-five on warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows on the edge of the nose, it grows and increases with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and completely uproot it, then apply to the area either cauterization or a burning medication that acts as cauterization.
If you miss cutting it until it grows, then look: if it is petrified, hard, dark in color, and has little feeling, do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor.
And I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer a great affliction as a result.
If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut it completely, then induce vomiting in the sick person, and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter twenty-six on suturing the nose, lip, and ear اذاتفرّق اتّصالها عن جرح او نحو ذلك
Know that whenever a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely succeeds except in some people.
So it is necessary, when something like this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with its blood, to bring the edges of the wound together by stitching, then treat it until it heals.
And if the separation of the connection has separated its lips and each side has become sound, it is necessary to excoriate each side with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds, then bring the two lips together by stitching and tighten them, and sprinkle on it ground costus and frankincense, and put over the powder a plaster of date palm ointment or other vulnerary ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it and change the medication, and leave it until the stitches fall out on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
The method of stitching is to bring together the separation of the connection either with needles as we described in stitching the abdomen, or with thread as I explained to you there.
Chapter twenty-seven on removing the nodules that appear on the lips.
Many people may experience small, hard tumors inside their lips. يشبه بعضها حبّ الكرسنّة وبعضها أصغر وأكبر.
It is necessary to turn the lip outward, make an incision on each nodule, catch it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then, after cutting, pack the area with powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops.
Then, rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter twenty-eight on cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call epulis (a type of gingival swelling).
It is necessary to hook it with a fishing hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base. وتترك المدّة تسيل او الدم
Then you apply powdered vitriol (hydrated ferrous sulfate) or one of the dried astringent peak substances to the area.
If that flesh returns after the treatment, it often does return. فاقطعه ثانية واكوه فإنّه لا يعود بعد الكىّ
Chapter twenty-nine on filing the teeth with iron.
Rough, ugly scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums. وقد تسودّ وتصفرّ وتخضرّ حتّى يصل من ذلك فساد الى اللثة وتقبح الأسنان لذلك.
So, you should sit the patient between your hands with his head in your lap and scrape the molar and the tooth in which the scales and the thing resembling sand have appeared to you until nothing of it remains. وكذلك تفعل بالسواد والخضرة والصفرة وغير ذلك حتّى تنقى.
If what is in it is gone from the first scraping, then fine, otherwise you repeat the scraping on it another day, and a second, and a third, until you reach the goal in what you want.
And know that the molar needs scrapers of various forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your work because the scraper with which the molar is scraped from the inside is different from the scraper with which it is scraped from the outside. والذى يجرد به بين الأضراس على صورة أخرى.
And these are several forms of scrapers that you should have, all prepared.
Chapter Thirty on the Extraction of Teeth
It is appropriate to treat the tooth for its pain with every possible remedy and to be hesitant about extracting it, for there is no replacement for it if it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, even if there is no alternative but to extract it.
So it is appropriate, if the ailing person is determined to extract it, that you ascertain and verify that the aching tooth is indeed the one, for often the pain deceives the ailing person, and he thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, and then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.
We have seen this from the actions of cuppers repeatedly.
So if you are certain about the aching tooth itself, then it is appropriate to incise around the tooth with a lancet that has some strength, until you loosen the gum from every side, then move it with your fingers or with the gentle forceps first, little by little, until you loosen it, then at that point secure it firmly with the large forceps while the ailing person's head is between your knees, firmly held so he doesn't move, then pull the tooth straight so you don't break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every direction gently, and keep moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or corroded, it is appropriate to fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin file so that it does not shatter when you pull on it with the forceps, and it is appropriate to be thorough in incising around the gum from every side carefully, and be careful with your effort so you don’t break it, and some of it remains, causing the ailing person a calamity greater than his first pain.
And beware of doing what the ignorant cuppers do in their haste and rushing into extracting it without using what we described, for they often inflict great calamities upon people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or some of its roots remain. أن يقلع ببعض عظام الفكّ كما شاهدناه مرارا،
Then after extracting it, he should rinse his mouth with wine or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs from the area, and this often happens, then crush some vitriol and pack the area with it, or otherwise cauterize it if the vitriol does not benefit you.
The shape of the gentle forceps with which you move the tooth first should be long-tipped, short-handled, and thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them.
And this is the shape of the large forceps:
It should be, as you see, thick in the handles so that when gripped it does not give way or bend, and short in the extremities.
And let it be made of Indian iron or of well-wrought, polished steel at the extremities. وفى طرفها أضراس يدخل بعضها فى بعض فتقبض قبضا محكما وثيقا
And the extremities may be made in the form of a file, and it will also be strong in gripping.
Chapter thirty-one on the extraction of the roots of the molars and the removal of the jaw bones.
The broken one, if upon extraction of the tooth a root remains that has broken, فينبغى أن تضع على الموضع قطنة بالسمن يوما او يومين حتّى يسترخى الموضع
It will have been made like a file from the inside or like a rasp.
If it does not respond to you to come out with these hooks, فينبغى أن تحفر على الأصل
Short at the end, slightly thick, and it should not be watered/polished, lest it break.
If the bone comes out with that, otherwise resort to these other instruments, whose image this is.
The first is triangular at the end, with some thickness in it.
Another nice triangular image/diagram:
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned previously in the filing of molars
And we may also use this instrument that resembles a large fishhook, which this is its image
Triangular, the curved end having some slight thickness so that it does not break, and it should be unpolished.
And know that the instruments for molars are numerous, and likewise the other instruments are almost innumerable, and the experienced and skilled craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves guide him to, because among diseases there are some for which the ancients did not mention instruments due to the difference in their types.
So if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then probe it in its place with what is suitable for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots, and we use a forceps, this is its form:
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone in place so it doesn't slip until the bone comes out.
And we treat the area with the appropriate medicines for that.
If the bone has some slight putrefaction, then scrape it from its putrefaction and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter thirty-two on the spreading of molars that grow on top of others.
If the molars grow in a way other than their natural course, they make the face ugly.
And especially if this happens in women and slaves, then you should look, and if the molar has grown behind another molar and it is not possible to spread it or file it, then extract it.
And if it is attached to another molar, then cut it with this instrument which is pictured here:
And it resembles a small beak. ولتكن من حديد هندىّ حادّة الطرف جدّا
And your cutting of it should be over many days, due to the hardness of the tooth. ولئلّا تزعزع غيرها من الأضراس
then file it with a file of Indian steel which has this form:
It should all be from India, and its point should be very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made.
File the tooth with it little by little over many days, gently, so that you do not shake the tooth and it falls out. ثمّ تملّسه آخرا وتجرده ببعض المجارد
And if a tooth has been broken and it bothers the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of the break disappears, and it becomes even and smooth, and does not harm the tongue, nor does it spoil speech.
Chapter thirty-three on joining loose molars with silver threads or with gold threads.
If the front molars become loose and move due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything edible lest they fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the treatment has not been successful
then the trick is to tie them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains in its state forever and is not affected by that.
The thread should be medium in thinness and thickness, as much as can fit between the molars.
And the method of tying is that you take the thread and insert its bend between the two healthy molars, then weave with the ends of the thread between the loose molars, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy molar on the other side, then you return the weaving to the side you started from.
And tighten your hand gently and wisely so that it does not move at all, and your tightening of the thread should be at the roots of the molars so that it does not escape.
Then cut the ends of the excess thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with the husk, and hide them between the healthy molar and the loose molar so that they do not hurt the tongue. ثمّ تترك هكذا مشدودة ما بقيت
If it becomes loose or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and they will enjoy it like this for the rest of their life.
This is a picture of the molars and the method of tying in two healthy molars and two loose molars, as you see.
And one or two teeth may return after falling out, to their places, and become fixed, as we have described, and remain.
And only a skilled and delicate craftsman does that.
And he may carve bone from the bones of cattle, and make from it the shape of a tooth and place it in the location from which the tooth has gone, and fasten it as we have said, and it remains and benefits from that.
The thirty-fourth chapter on cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This frenulum that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure for it is to open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that frenulum transversely until the tongue is released from its restriction.
If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knot is loosened.
Beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and cause bleeding.
Then he should rinse his mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water.
Then place a wick of linen under the tongue, which the patient holds every night so that it does not reattach.
If bleeding occurs, put powdered vitriol on the area. فإن غلبك الدم فاكو الموضع بمكواة عدسيّة تصلح لذلك ثمّ عالجه بسائر العلاج حتّى يبرأ
Chapter thirty-five on the extraction of the frog generated under the tongue.
A swelling may occur under the tongue, resembling a small frog, which prevents the tongue from its natural function. وربّما عظم حتّى يملأ الفم،
and the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the swelling. If you see it dark in color or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not touch it, for it is cancer.
But if it is tending towards white and has moisture in it, insert a hook into it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it from every side, فإن غلبك الدم فى حين عملك فضع عليه زاجا مسحوقا حتّى ينقطع الدم ثمّ عد الى عملك حتّى تخرجه بكماله
Then have him rinse his mouth with vinegar and salt, then treat him with all the other appropriate remedies until he recovers.
Chapter thirty-six on the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and what grows in the throat from other swellings.
Swellings resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils, may occur inside the throat.
If you treat them with what I mentioned in the chapter and they do not heal, then observe: if the swelling is hard, livid in color, and has little sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.
And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not touch it with an instrument either, for fear of bleeding. بل اتركه حتّى ينضج فإمّا أن تبطّه وإمّا أن يتفجّر من ذاته.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is the one that should be cut.
And the procedure for it is that you look before the operation, if its hot swelling has subsided completely or decreased somewhat, then you should sit the patient beside the sun with his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and take an assistant to stand in front of you to press his tongue down with an instrument like this image:
It is made of silver or copper, and it is thin like a knife.
So when you press the tongue with it, and the swelling becomes clear to you, and your sight falls upon it
then take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then you cut it with an instrument of this form: تشبه المقصّ الا أنّ طرفيها منعطفان
It is made from Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is not available وإلّا فاقطعها بمبضع
So after you cut one tonsil, you cut the other one in the same way,
Then after the cutting, the patient gargles with cold water or vinegar and water,
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops ثمّ تعالجه حتّى يبرأ،
And other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and you cut them in the same way as I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, tending towards numbness, with little sensation, which almost blocked the throat وكانت المرأة تتنفّس عن مجرى ضيّق
and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage وكان قد منعها الأكل وشرب الماء
and two branches had risen from the tumor until they came out of her nostrils
so I hurried and inserted a hook into one of them ثمّ جذبته فانجذب منه قطعة صالحة
then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril
then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril
then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue ثمّ أغرزت الصنّارة فى نفس الورم
so we continued to cut from that tumor repeatedly for a long time
and the tumor would replace what was cut حتّى طال بى وبها ذلك
So I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat from above فتوقّف عن الزيادة
then I traveled away from the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Chapter thirty-seven on the excision of the uvula tumor which is called grape.
If a catarrh descends to the uvula and swells and is white and oblong, then it is called 'amood'.
And if it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called 'inabah'.
If it is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided and it is thin, then it should be cut.
And what is of it gathered and round and does not have length and is bloody or the color of pus or black or has no sensation, then it should be avoided cutting it, for there is danger in it for the patient.
Then it is necessary, if you see it in the manner that I mentioned of its whiteness and length, that you seat the patient by the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument which was previously described. ثمّ تغرز الصنّارة فى العنبة وتجذبها الى أسفل وتقطعها بأحد الآلتين اللتين ذكرتهما فى قطع اللوزتين
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural order without addition, because if you cut more from it you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals.
If the patient is afraid of its cutting, then it is necessary that you use a trick in cauterizing it without fear or caution.
And the way of cauterizing it is only with the strong medicine, which is that you place the head of the patient in your lap, then you compress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. ثمّ تأخذ من الماء الحادّ الذى ذكرت فى باب الكىّ وتعجن به جيرا غير مطفأ وتجعله لا ثخينا ولا رقيقا وتملأ منه تقعير هذه الآلة وهذه صورتها:
Its end, in which you place the medication, has a concavity like the concavity of a cautery spoon.
And you place the instrument with the medication on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then you hold the medication with your hand and you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medication has subsided.
And if you wish, you can take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a cautery iron, and soak the cotton in the medication, and insert the cautery iron with the cotton in a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula; you do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then you leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to reapply the medication, you reapply it.
And after the cauterization, you wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee and dry the medication around it with it.
Then he gargles with cold water and is treated externally with poultices and internally with gargles until he recovers.
So, this type of treatment is safer than excision and further from fear.
And the uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and excision: it is treated with fumigation in this manner. يؤخذ فوذنج وزوفا وصعتر وسذاب وشيح وبابونج وقيصوم ونحوها من الحشائش فتجمعها كلّها او بعضها فى قدر وتغمر فى الخلّ وتغلى والقدر مطيّنة بطين الحكمة وتكون فى وسط الغطاء ثقبة تركّب عليها الآلة المجوّفة على هذه الصفة تصنع من فضّة او نحاس:
And you insert the end that contains the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well fumigated.
Then you repeat it several times until it withers.
And beware of doing this treatment at the first appearance of the swelling, because it often increases the swelling. وإنّما ينبغى أن تفعل ذلك عند انحطاط ورمها الحارّ
If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth does not burn, because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this is among the best treatments, along with its safety.
Chapter thirty-eight on the removal of thorns and what gets stuck in the throat other than that.
Often a bone, a fishbone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
It is necessary to remove from it what is visible to the eye after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the sunlight so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach. فربّما خرج الشىء الناشب بالقئ
Or the patient swallows a piece of turnip or the root of lettuce. او يتبلّع لقمة من خبز يابس
Do this several times. فكثيرا ما تلصق الشوكة او العظم فيها وتخرج
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than the sound, and at its end there is a curve that the patient inserts gently into his throat, while raising his head upwards. ويتحفّظ من مسّ حنجرته لئلّا يحدث به سعال.
And he pushes the bone or thorn with it, or the physician inserts it with his hand, and the patient's insertion of it is better because of his knowledge of the location of the embedded thing. ويدفع الى أسفل او يجذب يده بالآلة الى فوق كلّ ذلك على قدر ما يتهيّأ له حتّى يخرج،
Chapter thirty-nine on removing the leech stuck in the throat
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not succeed, then look at that time in the throat of the sick person in the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that was described to you, and if your sight falls on the leech, pull it with a small hook or with a smooth, tight piece of date fiber.
If you are not able to do it with it, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person near the leech, then insert into the inside of the tube a piece of iron heated by fire; you do this several times and the sick person abstains from water for his entire day, then he takes a bowl filled with cold water and opens his mouth in it and gargles with it and does not swallow a drop of it and moves the water from time to time with his hand, for the leech will fall on the spot when it senses the water.
If it does not come out with what we described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument that was described in the fumigation of the uvula, you do that several times, for it will fall.
And the way to work in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are embers heated by fire, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and you install in that hole the end of the instrument, then you throw in the incense, and the sick person puts his mouth at the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not come out until he knows that the smoke has reached his throat, for the leech will fall on the spot.
If it does not fall, then the fumigation is repeated several times and the sick person endures thirst and eats salty things and garlic and does not drink water, so it must come out with this procedure.
And this is a picture of an instrument with which you pull the leech from the throat if the sight falls on it, and it resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curvature that enters the throat, and its two ends resemble the mouth of a bird, in it is the roughness of a file; if it bites on something, it does not leave it.
And another instrument with which the tongue is depressed, and it is a wide ring of iron, as much as the mouth can accommodate above the tongue, enters the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will. ولا يستطيع أن يقلعها البتّة حتّى تنحيها:
(Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened according to this exact measurement)
The fortieth chapter: in it is made of the discussion about lancing tumors and incising them.
Tumors are of many various types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their lancing and incising in two aspects: one is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second aspect is the location in the body where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy area is different from a tumor occurring in a joint, each one having its own treatment rule.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be lanced while they are fresh and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to the joints, because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition prolongs until what is around it putrefies, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing chronicity of that limb, or the tumor may be near a major organ, so if you delay its lancing until it matures, you will harm that major organ, or it may be near the anus, so you lance it fresh.
It is necessary to lance the fresh, not fully matured tumor that is near the anus so that the depth does not putrefy and penetrate into the anus, becoming a fistula and becoming incurable.
You should know the time to lance tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other signs.
The lancing should be performed at the lowest point of the tumor if possible, so that it is easier for the fluid to flow downwards, or at the thinnest and most protruding point of the tumor.
The lancing should be lengthwise along the body if the tumors are in areas such as the hands and feet, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries, and in general in all flat areas without bending.
As for those that bend, the lancing should be done according to that area. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it until it is fully matured, as we have said, because if you lance it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
Some tumors may be lanced across the body when necessary or according to the needs of the limb.
You should use a single lancing for small tumors and a wide lancing or multiple incisions for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor.
Some tumors may require the skin to be scraped and cut if it has become like a rag and is dead, such as what occurs in many boils and abscesses.
Some are incised with a three-cornered incision, some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like inguinal tumors, and some use a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and so on.
Those that do not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, should only be lanced simply.
If the tumor is large and has accumulated a lot of fluid and you lance it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time, but rather remove some of it, then bandage the tumor until the next day, then remove some more pus, doing this gradually until you remove all of it, especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, because the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die without you realizing it, so be very careful about this.
After lancing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use linen or worn cotton thread. If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous, you should insert a wick into each incision until they reach each other.
If some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen lint without moisture and bandage it until the third day, then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding continues, you should use the management, treatment, and peaks that we have described in many places in this book and in the division.
If you are in the winter season and the location of the tumor is rich in nerves, you should moisten the pads with hot wine and oil and place them on the area.
If you are in the summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply pads soaked in cold water and oil or cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said, then you should untie the tumor, wipe it, and use similar treatment until it heals.
This is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one on incising the tumors that occur on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp. وهى من أنواع السلع تحويها صفاقات هى لها ظروف كأنّها حوصلة الدجاجة.
And its types are many, some of them are fatty. ومنها ما تحوى رطوبة تشبه الحمأة.
And there is no danger in incising them and extracting their contents, unless an artery obstructs you when you incise it.
The procedure for incising it is to first probe it with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called al-Midass (the probe), so that you know what it contains.
So if what it contains is moisture, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
And begin the incision from line B to line C. فإذا تفرّغت الرطوبة فاسلخ الكيس الذى كان يحوى تلك الرطوبة واقطعه جميعه ولا تترك منه شيئا البتّة فكثيرا ما يعود اذا بقى منه شىء
Then dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will consume what remains of the sac.
Then repeat the application of the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, if needed, until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains.
Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.
And if the swelling contains a fatty mass, incise it in this manner. شقّا مصلّبا والق الصنانير فى شفتى الجرح واسلخه من كلّ جهة.
If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you later, and do the same for the swelling if it is hardened from the incision, and the treatment is the same as I mentioned.
The incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture, and some of these swellings that are in the head in some people may have no moisture at all, and that is because I incised a swelling in the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like a hard, rough, white stone, I could not break it, and if someone threw it, it would injure him.
And what was of the other swellings occurring in the head other than this, such as the swellings that appear in the heads of children and at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make its bottom from its lower part to facilitate the flow of the material to the bottom, then treat it with what is appropriate for it of treatment.
The forty-second chapter on the incision on the scrofulas that appear in the neck.
These tumors frequently occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins, and they may occur throughout the body.
Those that occur in the neck can be single or multiple. ويتولّد بعضها من بعض.
And the types of these scrofulous tumors are many: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So, if I find one of them that feels good to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it is not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, and it is not deep, then it should be incised with a simple incision from top to bottom of the growth in this manner, from line C to line B.
And skin it from every side, and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or with two hooks, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding head tumors, and extract it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, lest your hand cuts more, or the patient moves, so you cut what you don't need to cut.
If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, then put in the wound crushed vitriol or some of the powders that stop the blood, and tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the tumor subsides, the wound relaxes and starts to suppurate, then the blood will stop then, so return to your work until you are finished.
Then search with your index finger, if other small tumors remained, then cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the tumor, then it is appropriate not to cut that tumor from its base, but it is appropriate to tie it with a doubled tight thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm, then fill the wound with worn cotton having dipped it in the Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the whole tumor, then it is appropriate to bring together the lips of the wound and sew it immediately after you know that no excess remains at all, but if you see that some excess remains due to the size of the tumor, then you should aim to cut it to its origin and base, and use stitching and what we mentioned.
And for tumors that contain fluids, poultice them with a simple poultice where their ripeness appears to you, and make the poultice from the lower part, as we said, then after the poultice, use the wick with the Egyptian ointment and the like to eat away what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter forty-three, on incising the larynx due to a swelling occurring inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the order of their words.
As for those with angina, they should avoid incising the larynx, as they will not benefit from it because all the vessels and the lungs are diseased.
But for those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, it is necessary to use the incision of the larynx to escape the damage that results from choking.
So, if we want to do that, we should incise the larynx below three or four rings of the trachea, a small horizontal incision between two rings, as much as the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for the incision because it is devoid of flesh and blood vessels are far from it.
If the practitioner is cowardly, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he avoids the blood vessels if he sees any of them, then he incises the membrane that we described.
The incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it with what is pierced and by the interruption of the voice, and you leave the wound open for a while, so when the time in which choking is feared is over, the lips of the skin wound are brought together and stitched alone without the cartilage, then the medicines that grow flesh are used until it heals.
The author of this book said, "The explanation of all these words that we have narrated is only if they see that the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these swellings that they mentioned, and the patient is near death, and his breathing is about to stop, they go to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe a little through the wound site and be saved from death.
And they were only ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the illness is over, and its course is three days or so, so then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
And what I witnessed myself is that a servant took a knife and put it to her throat and cut some of the trachea with it, so I was called to treat her, and I found her gurgling like a slaughtered animal, so I uncovered the wound and found the blood that came out of the wound was little, so I knew that she had not cut a vein or a jugular vein, and the air was coming out of the wound, so I proceeded and stitched the wound and treated it until it healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, nothing more, and she returned after a few days to her best condition, so from this we say that there is no danger in incising the larynx.
The forty-fourth chapter on incising the swelling that appears on the larynx from the outside. ويسمّى فيلة الحلقوم
This swelling, which is called "fīlat al-ḥalqūm" ("elephant of the larynx"), is a large swelling, the color of the flesh. وهو فى النساء كثير.
It is of two types: either it is natural or it is accidental.
As for the natural, there is no remedy for it.
And as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembles lipoma-like goods, and the other kind resembles the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it, so it is not appropriate to apply iron to it at all, except what is small of it. إن سبرتها وفتشّتها بالمدّس فألفيتها تشبه السلعة الشحميّة ولم تكن متعلّقة بشىء من العروق فشقّها كما تشقّ على السلع وتخرجها بما يحويها من الكيس إن كانت فى كيس وإلّا فاستقص جميعها.
Chapter forty-five, on fissuring in different kinds of goods/commodities.
Merchandise has many types, and I have mentioned all of its types in the classification.
And it is necessary that we explain here the difference between merchandise and abscess, as it is problematic.
So I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the excess subsides and the putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever and the acuteness subside.
With merchandise, there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it is contained in a peritoneal sac that is its special container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a duck, and bigger and smaller, and it is of two types, either fatty or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification.
So, when you come to treat merchandise, it is appropriate to probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, as its image comes in the chapter after this.
The method for examining all tumors and merchandise is that you take this instrument and insert it in the softest place you find in the tumor while you rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin, then press your hand according to the size of the tumor.
Then take out the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it may be, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in other tumors. And if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, so incise it with a hardened incision in this way, as I have taught you.
And hang it with hooks, and skin the skin from each side gently, and preserve the sac if you are able to remove it intact with the merchandise.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact, this happens often, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, because if something remains of it, little or much, the merchandise will mostly return.
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, cauterize the wound when you are finished with some sharp, corrosive peaks, and tighten the wound and place over it something that soothes the hot tumor, and treat it with other treatments until it heals.
If the merchandise is large, then stitch its lips and treat it with what heals.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the merchandise.
Chapter forty-six on the forms of instruments that are used in lancing and cupping.
Among them are forms of suppositories, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Form of a large suppository:
Picture of a pessary in the middle:
Image of a small mdass:
It is made of steel, square-shaped at the ends, well-made to facilitate entry into tumors.
And these are images of the probes, and they are called al-Bard (cold probes), and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. [This is an] image of a large probe:
Image of a medium probe:
Picture of a small probe:
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and hidden places, to see what is inside them, such as bones and other things.
It is made round, polished, and smooth, like probes, from Chinese copper or Spanish copper, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver, and the best of them are those made from Spanish copper.
Probes are also made from black lead. وتصلح ليسبر بها النواصير التى يكون فى غورها تعويج لتنعطف بلينها مع ذلك التعويج
It is also of three types, because some of them are long, some are medium, and some are short, according to the depth of each fistula.
And its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula.
Image of a probe made of large lead:
Image of a probe made of medium lead:
Image of a small lead probe:
Pictures of hooks, which are of many types, because among them are simple ones, I mean those that have one hook, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
And among them are the blind hooks, and they are of three types.
And among them are the hooks with two hooks, and they are of three types.
And among them are the curved hooks with two hooks, and they are of three types.
And among them are the hooks with three hooks, and they are of three types.
And all these types, each one of them is needed in its place; picture of a large simple hook:

And these are images of the scalpels with which goods and tumors are incised and excised, and they are of three types, because among them are large, and among them are medium, and among them are small,
Image of a large scalpel:
Image of a medium scalpel:
Picture of a small scalpel:
Its blades, with which it cuts, are limited, while the other ends are unlimited.
And they were made like this so that they could be used in skinning the merchandise when there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve. وليتآنس بها العليل ويجد الراحة قليلا من الحرقة التى يجدها عند سلخ الورم
And these are the forms of the scalpels, and they are of three types, because some of them are large, some are medium, and some are small. صورة مخدع كبير:
It is made of copper, similar to the collyrium stick used for applying kohl, and at one end is something like a wide spoon made of two layers, in the head of which is the blade of the lancet hidden within it, resembling a bird's tongue, moving in and out whenever you want, as you see.
Images of lancets that are concealed between the fingers when incising tumors, the patient does not feel them, and they are of three types, because among them are large, medium, and small.
Pictures of the cupping glasses with which bleeding is stopped, and they are of three types, because among them are large, medium, and small ones,
It is made of copper or Chinese porcelain, slightly rounded lengthwise as you see. وتكون الى الرقّة.
It is necessary to have these types of cupping vessels, both large and small, to cut off the blood quickly when necessary and when you do not have medicine.
But it is not used to cut off blood in every part of the body, but rather it is used in fleshy places such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy organs.
Other small instruments may be made from it, resembling pistachio shells, in this way:
It stops bleeding if it flows from the place of phlebotomy or when a vein or artery is cut.
And it may be made circular in this way:
Chapter forty-seven on the treatment of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts
The breast of some people may swell at puberty until it resembles a woman's breast, remaining swollen and unsightly.
So whoever dislikes this, it is appropriate to make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner from line B to line C. ثمّ اسلخ الشحم كلّه
Then, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. فإن مال الثدى الى أسفل واسترخى لعظمه كما يعرض للنساء فينبغى أن تشقّ فى جوانبه العليا بشقّين يشبهان شكلا هلاليّا يتّصل كلّ واحد منهما بالآخر عند نهايتهما حتّى يكون الخطّ الأكبر محيطا بالأصغر على هذه الصورة
If you are unable to completely cut what you should cut due to the patient's restlessness or because of bleeding, فينبغى أن تحشو الجرح بالقطن المغموس فى المرهم الأكّال
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig type, hard, contained in a sac.
When all the pus has been discharged from the swelling, wipe it with worn-out cotton. واتركه الى يوم آخر
Then remove the cotton and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
If the swelling is of the type of scrofula, then incise it as we mentioned in the incision on scrofula, similarly.
If the wound persists until it produces pus, then use cauterization on it as we mentioned previously.
Chapter forty-nine on incising the swelling that appears because of the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often occurs, and similarly, the vein may also experience inflation and swelling.
The signs by which it is known whether the swelling and inflation are from an artery or a vein are that if the swelling is from an artery, it is oblong, gathered in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you feel it as if it has a creaking sound, and if it is from a vein, the swelling is round, on the surface of the body.
Incision on these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body, and are very large, so you should avoid treating them with iron, and also those in the extremities or the head, so you should avoid [treating them].
So what is of them from the swelling of the mouth of the artery, make a lengthwise incision on the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then skin the artery and free it from the membranes until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I explained to you in the pulling of the two arteries that are in the temples, then prick with a lancet the place between the two ligatures until all the blood in it comes out and the swelling dissolves, then use the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from an incision of the vein, you should hold with your hand as much of the swelling as you can, along with the skin, then insert a needle below the place that you held with your hand, and pass it through, and in it a double thread, until you bring it out from the other side, then tie the swelling well with it, according to what I mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread.
If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle and tighten your threads in four places, then incise the swelling in its middle, so that when what is in it comes out, cut the excess skin and leave what was tied of it.
Then put on it a pad that you have dipped in wine and oil, then use the treatment that is with bandages and ointments until it heals.
Chapter fifty on the swelling that arises from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a swelling may occur in an artery or vein, so too may it occur in a nerve, whether due to a blow or from excessive fatigue or similar causes.
This occurs most frequently in the wrists and heel, and in every place where joints move. It is a protruding swelling, its color similar to the rest of the body, and it is most often painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
The swelling is not located deep within the body, but rather under the skin. It moves in every direction, yet doesn't go forward or backward.
So those that are in the joints, it is inadvisable to treat with iron instruments, for it may cause chronic pain.
And as for those that are on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.
If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the base. If it is large, hook it with a snare, peel it off, then extract it and close the wound with sutures, treating it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one on the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen
Warts, called fungal warts due to their resemblance to fungi, frequently appear on some people's stomachs and other parts of their bodies. Their base is thin, and their head is thick, with inverted lips. Some are small, while others become very large.
I have indeed seen a man with two warts on his stomach, resembling fungi exactly, white, with a thin base and inverted, cracked lips, constantly oozing moisture.
I cut them off, and I estimated the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
The procedure for removing them is to examine the patient; if the patient is of a moist constitution and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, then cut it with a wide scalpel, keeping cauterizing irons at hand in the fire, as often profuse bleeding occurs when cutting them, so be prompt. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it.
If you find the patient is cowardly and fears cutting with iron, take a tightly twisted lead thread and tie it around the wart with these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead. Continue tightening the lead whenever it affects the wart, until it cuts off and falls by itself without any effort.
If the wart is thick-based, cutting it involves some risk and danger, especially those located on the stomach. However, it is possible to cut off half or part of it and then cauterize it to prevent its recurrence.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, has little sensation, and has an unpleasant appearance, as it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter fifty-two on the treatment of umbilical hernia.
The protrusion of the navel happens for many reasons: either from a tear in the peritoneum over the abdomen, from which the omentum or the intestine emerges, as happens in all hernias, or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, as mentioned before, or from wind that accumulates in it.
If it is from a tear in the peritoneum and the exit of the omentum, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in different positions. If it is because of the exit of the intestine, then its state is, along with what we have described, more variable, and if you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then comes back, and perhaps it is accompanied by a gurgling, and it increases greatly when entering the bath and with intense fatigue.
If it is from moisture, then it is soft, does not disappear if you press it with your hand, and does not increase or decrease.
If it is from blood, then, along with these signs, the swelling appears dark.
If it is from growing flesh, then the swelling is hard, and remains at one size.
If it is from wind, then its touch is soft.
And the action in this is that you observe. If the protrusion of the navel is from the blood of the artery or the vein or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, as there is fear and danger in that, as I informed you in the chapter in which I mentioned the swellings that occur because of the artery and the vein.
If the protrusion of the navel is because of the intestine or the omentum, then you should order the patient to hold himself and stand upright and stretched out, then mark with ink around the entire navel, then order him to lie down between your hands on his back, then make an incision with a wide scalpel around the navel in the place that you marked with ink, then pull the center of the swelling upwards with a large hook, then tie the place of the incision with a strong thread or silk tendon with a firm tie, and the knot of the tie should be a loop, then open the center of the swelling that is pulled over the tie, and insert your index finger into it and search for the intestine. If you find that the tie has caught it, loosen the loop and push the intestine into the abdomen. If you find omentum, pull it with a hook and cut its excess.
If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off quickly and return to your work. Take two needles, insert two strong threads into them, and insert the two needles, hardened, into the incision you made around the swelling, having passed them through.
Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the pulled flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it heals.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh growing in it or from moisture, then it is necessary to scrape out the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will heal the place.
Chapter fifty-three on the treatment of cancer
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate.
And we mentioned the cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that whenever the cancer is in a place where it can be completely eradicated, such as the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is nascent and small.
But when it is advanced and large, it should not be approached, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me reach that.
And the procedure in it, if it is accessible as we said, is that you proceed to purge the patient with black bile several times, then bleed him if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you place in the cancer the hooks that are suitable for it, then you scrape it from every side with the skin thoroughly so that nothing of its roots remains. واترك الدم يجرى ولا تقطعه سريعا بل اعصر المواضع واسلت الدم الغليظ كلّه بيدك او بما أمكنك من الآلات،
If you encounter in the procedure a large bleeding from the cutting of an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four on the treatment of acne.
We have already explained in the section on classification the types of ascites, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medications.
And the one that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type,
and the drum-like type and the fleshy type should not be approached with iron at all, because that is deadly.
If you have treated this type of ascitic swelling with medications and your treatment has not been successful, فانظر فإن كان العليل قد بالغ فيه الضعف او كان به مرض آخر غير الحبن مثل أن يكون به سعال او إسهال ونحو ذلك فإيّاك أن تعالجه بالحديد فإنّه غرر
If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than the swelling alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, فوجه العمل فيه أن تقيم العليل واقفا بين يديك وخادم خلفه يعصر بطنه بيديه ويدفع الماء الى أسفل الى ناحية العانة
then take a pointed scalpel like this: محدود الجهتين طويلا محدّد الطرف كالمبضع إلّا أنّ فيه بعض الفطس قليلا لئلّا تجوز به عند العمل الى المعاء فتؤذيه
Then look, if the hernia originates from the intestines, it is appropriate to distance the incision from the navel by three fingers downwards, along it, above the pubis.
If the hernia originates from liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel.
If it originates from spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side, about three fingers.
It is also not appropriate for the incision to be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument. ثمّ تدخل الآلة فى ذلك الشقّ وترفع يدك بالمبضع بين الجلد والصفاق كأنّك تسلخه ويكون القدر الذى تسلخه قدر الظفر او نحوه
Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is the location of the fluid. ثمّ تخرجه وتدخل فى الثقب الآلة التى هذه صورتها
Its end may be sharpened like the point of a pen, in this form: فى طرفها الأعلى حلقة
For when the instrument reaches the water, it will descend from its reservoir onto the instrument, and it will discharge a moderate amount of water at that time.
Because if you discharge from it more than is necessary at the time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or he may experience fainting close to death.
But discharge from it according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you, from the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his color.
Then remove the instrument and stop the water.
This is because it stops from its reservoir due to the leather that covers the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that manner.
Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient can tolerate it, and also extract a small amount of water.
Do this for several days, while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains.
If you fear for the patient and have left a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand, and with profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and make him endure thirst, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.
And cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after extracting the water as I described previously.
Chapter fifty-five on the treatment of children who are born and places.
Their urine [opening] is not perforated, or the perforation is narrow, or in the wrong place.
Some boys may come out of their mother's womb with their urethra not perforated.
So it is necessary to hasten to perforate it from the hour he is born with a very thin scalpel in this way:
Then you put in the hole a thin nail made of lead, tie it and keep it for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, remove it and let him urinate, then put it back.
And if you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine that passes over the place will not let it close.
As for the one whose hole is narrow, it is treated with the lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.
And those whose hole is not in its place, that is, some of them are born with the hole at the end of the penis, so he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the urethra with his hand upwards. ولا يولد له من قبل أنّ المنى لا يقدر على الوصول الى الرحم على استقامة وهى علّة قبيحة جدّا
The way to do this is to have the patient lie on his back, then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong stretch, and sharpen the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle would be prominent, similar to a penis, and so that the hole would be in the middle as it should be.
And beware of bleeding during your work, for it often happens, so counteract it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter fifty-six on the rash that appears on the foreskin, glans, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra, and it is a fleshy, foul growth, and it can be malignant or benign.
The benign one should be grasped with a delicate hook and cut until it is completely cleaned, then apply to it cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals.
But if the ulcer is malignant and foul-colored, then cauterization should be used after cutting and scraping it.
If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some of it is outside, then the ulcer that is inside should be extracted first until it heals, and then treat it from the outside because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not be perforated.
Blackness and decay may also occur in the labia and in the foreskin, so it is necessary to scrape all that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed, then smear on it honey with ground, sifted pomegranate peels and kirsana, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it becomes infected.
If the glans penis is eroded and completely gone at some point, then a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.
As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans penis, and this adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin is intact and who is not obligated to be circumcised, and its adhesion may occur due to a wound or swelling, it should be peeled off with a blunt scalpel until the bond dissolves and the glans penis is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon investigation, then something from the glans penis and the foreskin should be peeled off, because the foreskin is thin, so it may be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again, then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven on purifying/circumcising boys and treating what befalls them of errors/mistakes/accidents.
It should be a sharp, straight scalpel, with a smooth nail. ويكون طول الشفرتين كطول المقبضين سواء.
As for the error that occurs during circumcision, sometimes the inner skin is completely or partially inverted during the cutting.
Therefore, you should immediately stretch it with your fingernail before the area swells and cut it evenly.
If you are unable to grasp it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.
If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides, then gently peel it off and cut it as you see fit.
Be careful of the head of the urethra, for if something is cut from the head of the urethra, it will not harm it.
Treat it with what heals the wound from the peaks that we described in the article on peaks.
And if some of the skin is cut beyond the required amount and it retracts upwards, that also does not cause much harm.
So treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight on the treatment of urine retained in the bladder
The urine retained in the bladder is due to its blockage from a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or growing flesh, and so forth.
So if you treat that with the types of treatment described in the classification that we mentioned, and the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is from a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is appropriate to make the patient kneel on his knees, squatting. ثمّ يركب رجل على ظهره ويمدّ بطنه الى ظهره و يمسك العليل نفسه ما أمكنه فيضطرّ حينئذ عنق المثانة الى دفع الحصاة الى خلف فينطلق البول،
But if it is not released by what we mentioned, and the matter intensifies for the patient, it is appropriate to resort to extracting it with the instrument called a catheter, which is pictured here:
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like the tube of a bird's feather in the thinness of the الميل, long about a span and a half, and has a delicate funnel at its head.
And the way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie at its end wool or cotton with a good knot and insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube, plugging it like a button.
Then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and sit the patient on a chair and anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water.
Then insert the catheter gently into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it until the urethra is bent, then push the catheter inwards until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that it has reached something empty, and it is made in this manner because the passage in which the urine flows is crooked.
Then pull the thread with the wool gently, for the urine will follow the wool. ثمّ تخرجها ويهرق البول،
And reinsert the catheter and continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine
How to inject the bladder with a syringe وصور الآلاتالتى تصلح لذلك
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, it has a long thin tube, and if you want to instill water and medicine into it, this will be by a tool called a syringe
It is made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long, thin, hollow tube, except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow place in which the piston is, should be of a size that it fills it without any extra space, so that if you pull something of the fluids with it, it is drawn, and if you push with it, it is pushed to a distance, similar to how the pump is made, which is used to throw naphtha in sea battles.
So if you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the piston upwards, then the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the syringe.
Then you insert its tip into the urethra, according to what we described for catheters, then you push the fluid with the piston, and that fluid reaches the bladder at the spot until the patient feels it.
And this is a picture of a nice syringe also, with which you inject the bladder:
It is made of silver or "espadroia", its upper head resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the bandage is placed.
Then you take a camel bladder and put in it the moisture that you want to inject into the bladder, then tie it between the two partitions tightly with a doubled thread and warm that moisture a little on the fire.
Then you insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture tightly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of thin leather, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around, then insert a strong thread into that hole as you turn.
Then gather the circle as you gather the tablecloth after putting in it what you want of moistures, oils, and water, then tie it in the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty on Extracting the Stone
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and we have mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all of that, and we have mentioned the stones in which the work is done by hand and incision, which are the stones generated in the bladder specifically, and those that stick in the urethra, and I will describe that with a clear explanation and brevity, so I say that the stones generated in the bladder most often affect boys, and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them,
and it is easy for boys to recover from them until they reach fourteen years of age, and it is difficult in old men, and as for young men, it is intermediate between that, and the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that,
So if we proceed to treatment, it is necessary first to inject the patient with an enema that removes all the dung that is in his intestines, because it may prevent the presence of the stone during examination, then the patient is taken by his feet, and he is shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times, then you sit him between your hands upright, and his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is tilted downwards, then you examine him and palpate him from the outside, so if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately proceed with the incision on it, but if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown boy, then insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, so that when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place where you want to incise it, and you order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision will be,
Then you take the lancet, which is this image: وتشق فيما بين المقعدة والأنثيين لا فى الوسط بل الى جانب الألية اليسرى ويكون الشقّ على نفس الحصاة وأصبعك فى المقعدة وأنت تضغطها الى خارج مورّبا ليكون الشقّ من خارج واسعا ومن داخل ضيقا على قدر ما يمكن خروج الحصاة منه لا أكبر فربّما ضغطت الأصبع التى فى المقعدة الحصاة عند الشقّ فتخرج من غير عسر،
And know that some stones have angles and edges, so their exit is difficult for that reason, and some are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy.
So what has angles and edges, you increase the incision a little, and if it does not come out like this, then you should contrive against it, either by grasping it with a tight forceps, the tip of which is like a file, so that it grips the stone and it does not escape from it, or by inserting a fine instrument with a hooked tip under it.
If you cannot manage it, then widen the incision a little, and if some blood overcomes you, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise on it, then push the small one after that, and likewise, you do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to make a large incision on it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things: either he dies, or he has constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal at all, but try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with hooks until you bring it out in pieces.
So when you finish your work, pack the wound with frankincense, aloe, and costus, and tighten it, and put over it rags soaked in oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the hot swelling, then the patient lies on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day, and when it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.
If an excessive hot swelling and erosion or the like occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and urine being prevented from it, and this is known by the exit of blood with the urine, then insert your finger in the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it leads to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and address each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
It is necessary during all treatment times to tie the thighs and bring them together to stabilize the medicines that are placed on the area.
If the stone is small and it goes into the urethra and gets stuck in it, and urine is prevented from exiting, then treat it with what I am describing before it reaches the incision, for I have often dispensed with the incision with this treatment, and I have tried it, which is that you take a branched instrument of steel, this is its form:
Triangular-tipped, sharp, and embedded in a stick.
Then you take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then you gently insert the forked instrument into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself, and you turn the fork with your hand on the stone little by little while you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, then the urine will flow immediately.
Then you squeeze your hand over what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing so, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then cut on the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then remove it, then untie the tie and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound.
It is necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other tie from above so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, it is advisable for you, if you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter sixty-one on removing stones for women
Stones rarely form in women.
If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and prevented for many reasons.
One of them is that the woman may be a virgin.
The second is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician if she is chaste or has close male relatives.
The third is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially working with the hand.
The fourth is that the location of the incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision, and in that is danger.
If necessity calls for it, then it is best to find a skilled female physician.
And they are rarely found. فإن عدمتها فاطلب طبيبا عفيفا رفيقا اوتحضر امرأة قابلة محسنة فى أمر النساء او امرأة تشير فى هذه الصناعة بعض الإشارة فتحضرها وتأمرها أن تصنع جميع ما تأمرها به من التفتيش على الحصاة أوّلا
That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin, then she should insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger, then you should instruct her to make an incision over it.
If she is not a virgin but is a widow, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can until she reaches the base of the thigh, then make an incision over it opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh, from whichever side she can reach it and feel the stone in that area, with her finger not moving from the stone, pressing it underneath.
The incision should be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, then she should increase the incision to the extent that she knows the stone will come out of it.
Know that the types of stones are many, including small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched. Know their types to be guided by that to what you want.
If the bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle crushed vitriol on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove the stone.
Make sure you prepare for yourself the instruments that I mentioned for removing stones in men, to help you in your work.
If the bleeding overcomes you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then place a cautery on the area and tighten it with bandages tightly, and leave it and do not return to it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, as the patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area putrefies, return to your work to remove the stone.
Chapter sixty-two on incising the watery vein.
Hydrocele is the collection of moisture in the white membrane that is under the skin of the testicles surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum, and it may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature on one side of the testicle, so that one might think it is another testicle, and it may be between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane that we mentioned, and this only occurs rarely.
This hydrocele arises from a weakness that affects the testicles, so this substance flows to it, and it may result from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture is of many colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or turbid black, or watery white, which is the most common.
The signs by which the collection of water is known are that if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, the swelling will be slightly elongated and round, like the shape of a testicle, and the testicle will not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle, and for this reason, one might imagine it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, it will be perceptible by touch.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose picture has been presented, and whatever comes out after the probe, you will judge it by what is inside it.
So, if we proceed to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to be bled, if he is able to do so and you see that his body is full, then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, and you should place many rags under him, then you should sit on his left and order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis to one side of the skin of the testicles and towards the flank, then you take a wide scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise to near the pubis, making the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicles in half until it reaches the containing white membrane, then you peel it off, being careful not to cut it, and your peeling of it should be from the side that is more attached to the testicle, and you should complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then you pad the water-filled membrane with wide padding and remove all the water.
Then you separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the membrane upwards, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicle, and you cut the membrane however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece, especially its thin side, because if you do not complete its cutting, you cannot be sure that the water will not return.
If the testicle protrudes out of its skin during your work, when you have finished cutting the membrane, put it back, then bring together the edges of the skin of the testicle with sutures, then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.
If you find that the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, you should tie the vessels that are in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the collected water is on both sides, know that they are two hydroceles, so cut the other side as you did on the first, and if it is possible for you to perform the operation as one, then do so.
Then you wipe the blood and insert wool dipped in oil or rose oil into the incisions, and put other wool dipped in syrup and oil on the outside and spread it over the testicles and the flank, and place folded rags over it, which are the compresses, and tie them from above with the bandage that has six ends, in this way:
Then two pieces of cloth are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with carded wool according to this example.
And the ends with which it is tied are made of cotton or moist wool. وتجمع بالشدّ فى حزام السراويل.
And one of the ends is taken on the buttocks to the back. والثانى تأخذ الى نحو العانة.
And this bandage may also be made by cauterization instead of incising with iron.
Which is that you take a fine knife-shaped cautery and incise with it the skin of the testicles while it is hot, as we have described, until the white membrane containing the water is exposed.
Then take another cautery of this shape: وهى تشبه العين اليونانيّة،
then you cauterize with it that peritoneum while it is hot until all the moisture comes out,
then you stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery iron and cut it as much as you can until you completely eradicate it and be careful with the testicle, do not touch it with the fire,
and know that this procedure is safer and further from bleeding and better than the incision procedure,
if you encounter during the incision or during cauterization a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then you should treat whatever you encounter of that with the appropriate treatment as mentioned before,
if the patient is cowardly and does not have patience for this procedure because of its ugliness, then let him use the lancing as I will describe it,
and if it is confirmed for you by the evidence we presented that the hydrocele is watery, then you should sit the patient on a high chair,
then lance the swelling at its bottom with a wide scalpel and make the lancing along the body and let the opening be wide so that all the water flows out,
then put cotton on the area and bandage it and leave it to absorb the remaining water, ثمّ عالجه حتّى يبرأ الجرح،
if the exit of the water is difficult during your lancing of it, and that is only because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, فحينئذ ينبغى أن تدخل فى الجرح ريشة إوزّ او الآلة التى يستخرج بها ماء المحبونين التى تقدّمت صورتها او زد فى فتح الجرح قليلا،
and know that the water may return and collect after six months or so, فإذا اجتمع فبطّه على الصفة نفسها ويدافع العليل أيّامه،
Chapter sixty-three on incising the fleshy vein and its treatment
Know that incising this testicle is one of the dangers that leads to death in most cases, so we recommend leaving it alone and ensuring safety from it.
I will mention the procedure for it and the types of swelling, and I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies in which the testicles are located, and this may happen for many reasons.
Either from excess sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling is the same as the color of the body, and it has no fluid, and the swelling is hard.
Perhaps the swelling is petrified, its color is like pus, and it has no sensation.
It may also be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as mentioned before, or from a swelling of the veins.
So what is from a swelling of the arteries is known by the dissipation of the swelling if you press it with your fingers, and it should not be touched at all.
As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it dissipates when pressed with the fingers.
This type can be incised, as well as the other flesh, and that is by incising the skin of the scrotum, then extending the testicle upwards and taking it out of the white membrane, and freeing the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tying the vessels, and cutting the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle.
If the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh, then the testicle should be taken out and cut off.
And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, then all of that adhesion should be freed and cut off in a circular cut.
If the growth of the flesh is in the place of the adhesion, which is from behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle taken out as we said.
So, when your work is completed, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four on the treatment of urinary incontinence with dialia.
The dalia is a twisted, somewhat convoluted swelling, resembling a cluster of grapes, accompanied by relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this ailment, there are dangers close to what has been mentioned before, but it is necessary to mention the procedure in it as the predecessors did.
So I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis, and have another assistant hold them and stretch them firmly. Then, make an oblique incision with a wide, sharp scalpel along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I mentioned to you in the stripping of the arteries that are in the temples. Then, insert a needle with a doubled thread into them and tie it at the beginning of the places where the dalia appeared, and also tie it at the end. ثمّ تشقّها فى الوسط شقّا قائما على طول البدن وتخرج ما اجتمع فيها من الرطوبات العكرة الفاسدة ثمّ تعالج الجرج بعلاج سائر الجراحات التى تريد أن تتولّد فيها مدّة لتسقط الأوعية التى تغذو إحدى الأنثيين فلا بأس بذلك،
If the dalia affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lack nourishment because of the cutting of the vessels, and thus wither and become useless.
Chapter sixty-five on the treatment of intestinal strangury.
The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the soft parts of the abdomen, so the intestine pours from that rupture to one of the two testicles, and this rupture can be either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and so on.
And its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long period, and it does not happen suddenly, and the swelling will be level towards the depth because the peritoneum squeezes the intestine.
And its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning it causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling will be distinct, appearing under the skin nearby, and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its passage outside the peritoneum.
And the omentum might come out with the intestine, so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it may be with flatulence.
And excrement might run in the intestine and be trapped there, so with it comes the demise of the patient because it causes difficult pain and rumbling, especially if squeezed.
And the treatment of these types of illness with iron is dangerous, so one should beware of falling into it.
The method of operation is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand to inside his cavity, if it is possible to return, then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the testicle lengthwise, then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision as much as needed to open the incision with them, and the incision should be as much as the testicle can come out of.
Then you peel the peritoneal layers that are under the skin of the testicle until the hard white peritoneum is exposed from all sides, then insert your index finger next to the testicle between the white peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle and between the second peritoneum, and release with it the adhesion that is behind the testicle.
Then you bend with the right hand to inside the skin of the testicle, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand, and you raise the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision, and you order the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you release the adhesion that is behind completely, and you search with your finger so that there is nothing of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum, and if you find something of it, push it to the lower abdomen.
Then you take a needle with a thick thread that has been twisted from ten threads, and you insert it at the end of the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle next to the incision, then you cut the ends of the folded thread until there are four threads, then you assemble them on top of each other in a hardened form, and you tie with them the peritoneum that we said is under the skin of the testicle with a tight knot from two sides, then you also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish it can reach it, so that no hot swelling occurs from that, and also make a second knot outside the first knot, less than two fingers away from it, and after these two knots you leave from the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle the size of a finger bone, and you cut all the rest in a circular shape and remove the testicle with it.
Then you incise below the skin of the testicle an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously.
Then wool dipped in oil is used and placed in the wound, and the bandage that we described is used. وقد يكوى الصفاق الأبيض الذى قلنا بعد قطعه حذرا من نزف الدم فكثيرا ما يعرض ذلك،
And you leave the bandage until it falls off on its own, and if its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water and something that makes him sweat should be applied to him until it falls off, then the wound is treated with all other wound treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six on flatulence.
This airy adra, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron.
And the ancients mentioned that it should be made as we described in the adra that is with dalia. وذلك أن تربط الأوعية بعد الشقّ عليها برفق أسفل ثمّ تشقّ فى الوسط
And treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven on the hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells, and nothing of the intestine descends to the testicles.
And if it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum.
This occurs from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said, and that is that the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes.
And its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
It may also be treated with iron in this manner: The patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the place of the swollen hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you pad the peritoneal layers that are under the skin until the white peritoneum that follows it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding places on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and stick one to the other with the stitching.
Then you pull the edge of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds. So when the threads are cut, you clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight on the relaxation of the scrotum's skin.
Often the skin of the testicles relaxes in some people without the flesh inside them relaxing, and their appearance becomes ugly.
So it is appropriate for whoever wishes to treat it to put the patient on his back and cut all the skin that has relaxed on the thick skin, then bring the two edges together.
And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine on castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion, and therefore I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: one is that it should be in the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it, and that he should know the treatment of whoever is afflicted by it.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit, such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like.
So I say that castration is of two types, either by crushing or by incision and cutting.
The one that is done by crushing, the way to do it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften and hang down, then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible to the touch.
As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle so that when the two testicles emerge, you cut them after skinning them and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.
And this type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter seventy on the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite occurs in men in two types. أحدهما أنّه يظهر فيما يلى الفضاء او فى جلدة الخصى فيما بين الأنثيين شكل كأنّه فرج امرأة فيه شعر
And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum skin.
As for in women, it is of one type. ويكون فوق الفرج على العانة كمذاكير الرجل صغار البتّة ناتية الى خارج أحدهما كأنّه قضيب الرجل والاثنان كالأنثيين
And the treatment of the three types, the two types of men and the one type of women, it is necessary to cut off those excess flesh until its trace disappears. ثمّ تعالجها بعلاج سائر الجراحات حتّى يبرأ
As for the second type of men, from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum skin, there is no action in it, nor any healing from it at all.
Chapter seventy-one on the excision of the clitoris and the flesh that grows from women's vulvas
The clitoris may sometimes grow beyond its natural size until it becomes ugly and unpleasant in appearance. وقد يعظم فى بعض النساء حتّى ينتشر مثل الرجال ويصير الى الجماع
Therefore, you should hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it.
And do not cut deeply, especially at the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
As for the excess flesh, it is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it. وربّما خرج الى خارج على مثال الذنب ولذلك يسمّيه بعض الأوائل المرض الذنبىّ
Chapter seventy-two on the treatment of atresia.
Atresia is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the opening is small, and it is either congenital, in which she is born with it, or acquired.
So, the acquired type results from a preceding ailment, and it is either from excess protruding flesh, or a thin or thick membrane, and it is either in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or in its upper or lower part, and it prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation.
Knowing this is by the midwife's inspection, if the blockage is apparent and close, but if it is not apparent, she examines it with her fingers or a probe.
So, if the blockage is from a thin membrane and it is close to the labia, then immediately perforate it, which is that you place something like padding on the labia, then put both your thumbs from both hands, and the woman is on her back with her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia with force until you perforate the thin membrane and the blockage opens.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and have intercourse with the woman every day so that the area does not rejoin again.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel, resembling a myrtle leaf.
And if the obstruction is from protruding flesh, hang it with hooks and cut it, and have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, chebulic myrobalan, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.
Keep it for some days, and use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with the rest of the healing treatment until it is cured.
And other fleshy growths may occur in the uterus, so they should be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should not be touched with iron at all.
Chapter seventy-three on the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pimples that appear on women's genitals.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins until much blood flows from it constantly.
So when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become warts, and I have mentioned in the classification their types and signs, and we mention here what accepts treatment from them and what does not accept treatment.
So I say that if the hemorrhoids and warts are in the depth of the uterus and have not appeared to the senses, then there is no treatment for them with iron.
And what is of them in the mouth of the uterus, the senses fall upon it, it is what is treated.
So it is necessary that the woman enter a cold room then stretch the warts with tweezers or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle on it, when the blood flows, one of the styptics that stop the blood without cauterization, such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like.
Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour then hang them in cold water.
Then if the bleeding continues, make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like.
Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar and apply a bandage with it on her back.
Then if the bleeding stops, and if not, then adhere to cupping the back and the breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in purslane juice or plantain juice or blackberry branch juice with gallnut drink and apply it to the area.
Then when the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.
As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of snakes, rough in appearance.
So it is necessary to cut what appears of it according to what I mentioned about the warts exactly and treat it until it heals.
Chapter seventy-four on slow ripening of the abscess that occurs in the uterus
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, petrified tumors, ulcers, abscesses, corroding sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors, and all these diseases, their types, and their signs have been mentioned in the classification, so it is appropriate that we mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that collect matter, how its opening with iron instruments should be.
It is appropriate that you examine it, and if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever, and you see it red when touched, then do not rush to open it, and treat it with what helps it to ripen until these symptoms subside, and at that time, it is appropriate that the woman sit on a chair with two seats, and lean on her back, and gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs be spread apart, and put her arms under her knees and tie them with a suitable bandage, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the picture of which will come later.
It is appropriate, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate the depth of the woman's uterus with a probe, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus and harm the patient, and if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is appropriate that supports be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is appropriate that the screw that runs in the instrument be on the upper side while you hold the instrument and the servant turns the screw until the cervix opens.
And when the abscess appears and is touched by hand, and it is soft and thin, it is appropriate to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel, and when all the matter is discharged, it is appropriate to put in the wound a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, and the wick should come out of the incision in the cervix, and pure wool dipped in water in which marshmallow has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis, then treat after two days with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
The uterus and the wound may also be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment.
If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus, it is appropriate to refrain from treating it with iron, rather it should be treated with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-fifth in teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they come out in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth, and its signs are: if you see the woman pushing downwards and longing to smell the air, and her labor pains become easier for her, and the exit of the fetus is quick, then know that this birth will be in the natural form, and its exit will be headfirst, and the placenta with it or hanging from its umbilical cord.
So if you see these signs, it is appropriate to press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly, because if it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and she cleanses well from those excesses.
And other than this birth, it is unnatural and undesirable because the fetus may come out on its feet, or its hands may come out before its head and feet, or one hand or one foot may come out, or its head and hand may come out, or it may come out folded, and perhaps it turns on its back, and similar undesirable forms.
So it is appropriate for the midwife to be skillful and gentle in all these things and to beware of slips and errors, and I am explaining each form of them and the proper technique for it so that you may be guided by that and understand it.
If the fetus comes out headfirst, the natural exit, and that is difficult for the woman, and labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then sit her on a chair and order women to hold her, and apply a poultice to her uterus with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments.
Then the midwife inserts a small lancet between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture in it flows out, and presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is appropriate to inject the woman with fenugreek mucilage with oil of euphorbia, then after the injection, order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately.
If the fetus's hand comes out first, it is appropriate to push them back gently little by little, if they do not go in, then place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaking, if the hands do not go in and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull the rest of the fetus or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for it will come out. خروج الجنين على رجليه،
Exit of the fetus on its feet. اذا خرج الجنين على رجليه فينبغى أن تدفعهما الى فوق ثمّ تحوّل الجنين قليلا قليلا حتّى تسوّيه ثمّ تأخذ إحدى رجليه فتمدّها قليلا قليلا فإذا خرجتا الى الفخذين فأمرها أن تتزّحر وعطّسها بالكندس فإنّه يخرج،
If it does not come out as we described, then return the fetus little by little until you put it in the natural form, then it will come out smoothly.
If it resists with all that we described, then take marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, oil of euphorbia, and dissolved gum, and grind all of them in a mortar well, then anoint with it the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then sit her in lukewarm water until it reaches the thighs.
So if you see that her lower part has softened, then make for her a suppository of myrrh and let her bear it, and if she holds the suppository for an hour, then sit her on the chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately. خروج الجنين على ركبتيه ويديه،
Exit of the fetus on its knees and hands. إذا خرج على هذه الصفة فاحتل فى إدخال يديه قليلا قليلا ثمّ تستلقى المرأة على قفاه وتدلّى رخليها الى أسفل وهى مضطجعة على سرير وتضمّ يديها ثمّ اعصر فوق بطنها قليلا قليلا ثمّ أخرج ما تحت رجليها من الوسائد حتّى تكون منصوبة الأسفل فإن لم يخرج الجنين فخذ رجليها جميعا فحرّكهما حركة شديدة ثمّ اعصر فوق الشراسيف قليلا قليلا حتّى يصعد الجنين الى فوق ثمّ تدخل القابلة يدها وتسوّى الجنين قليلا قليلا وأمر المرأة أن تتزحّر حتّى يخرج الجنين،
Exit of the fetus transversely, hanging one of its hands. احتل فى ردّ يده فإن لم تقدر على ردّها فأقم المرأة واجعلها تمشى فإن لم تقدر على المشى فتضطجع على سريرها وهزّ ساقيها هزّا شديدا ثمّ استعمل اللطوخ الذى وصفت من اللعابات فإن أخذها الطلق فأجلسها على كرسىّ ثمّ عالج فى ردّ اليد وتسوية الجنين على الشكل الطبيعىّ وعطّس المرأة وأمرها أن تتزحّر حتّى يخرج،
Exit of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face is towards its mother's back. ينبغى أن تمسك القابلة يد الجنين ثمّ تحوّله قليلا قليلا وتسوّيه برفق فإذا استوى فاحمل على قبلها ما وصفنا من الدهن واللعابات ثمّ مرها أن تتحرّك قليلا قليلا فإذا فعلت ذلك فأجلسها على الكرسىّ وأمرها أن تميل الى الجانب الأيمن ثمّ مرها أن تتزحّر وتعطّسها بالكندس فإنّه يخرج،
Exit of the fetus upright on its side. إذا نزل الى فم الرحم على هذه الصفة مع المشيمة فشقّ المشيمة بظفرك حتّى تتفرّغ من الرطوبة فإن تعلّقت على وجه الجنين وعنقه فاقطعه من السرّة لئلّا يحتنق فيموت ثمّ ادفع الجنين الى داخل حتّى تصيره على ما ينبغى وأمر المرأة أن تتزّحر مرّات فإنّه يخرج خروجا سهلا،
Exit of twins or many fetuses. اعلم أنّ التوأمين كثيرا ما يولدون وقد تولد ثلاثة او أربعة ويعيشون إلّا أنّ ذلك فى الندرة وأمّا الخمسة فهو شىء خارج عن الطبيعة لا يعيشون البتّة،
And one placenta surrounds them, even if they are many, and they are separated by a dividing membrane between them connected to the umbilical cord of each one of them.
And they may come out as a single fetus comes out, a natural, easy exit, and they may come out in an undesirable exit as we described, so if some of them have difficulty at birth and become in what we mentioned of unnatural forms, then treat it as we described.
And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience, and use strategies for each form with what is available to her of techniques leading to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses and then they are miscarried.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus, and it has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived, that is by the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing.
So all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, perhaps something like that will happen to her one day, so she addresses it as appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six on the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with the treatment I mentioned in the division, and it did not come out, and you are forced to work by hand, then you should look. If the woman is of sound strength and has none of the symptoms that are feared to cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back, with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.
Then moisten the opening of her womb with moist oils, along with the saliva of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and salivas, then insert it gently into the womb, then search for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus.
And the appropriate places for that, look, if the fetus is coming down head first, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or in the back of its head, or in its mouth, or in its jaw, or under its chin, or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the cartilage.
But if it is coming down feet first, then in the pubis and middle ribs.
And you should hold the hook with the right hand and place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently, and insert a hook in some of those places that we mentioned until you reach something empty, then insert another hook or a third opposite it if you need to, so that the pull is even and does not tilt to one side, then extend it evenly, and the extension should not be straight only, but move it to each side to facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when extracting it, and it should be loosened between pulls. If one side of it gets stuck, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from one side to rotate what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to other places that are a little higher. Do this until the entire fetus comes out.
If a hand comes out before anything else and cannot be pushed back because of its compression, then you should wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it all comes out, you cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and so you should do with the other hand and with the legs.
If the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure on it during exit, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then you should insert a pointed scalpel between your fingers and incise the head so that the fluid comes out, or perforate it with the instrument called the perforator, whose image comes with the images of all the instruments in the chapter after this. And so you do if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then you should incise the skull or crush it with the perforator as we said, then remove the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, then incise it until the moisture in the chest pours out, for then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and it is not possible to exit, then cut it in pieces as much as you can.
If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a swelling, then you should puncture it so that the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and aligning it to the opening of the womb is simple.
If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and incise the abdomen or chest until what is in them drains.
If all the other limbs have been extracted and the head has receded and is stuck, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the opening of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with her fingers to the opening of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the opening of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has occurred, then it should not be forced, but rather the pouring of moist, fatty things should be used, and bandages should be applied, and she should sit in water that softens and moistens.
But if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be aligned, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If this is not possible, then cut it into pieces and remove it.
And you should not leave any of the placenta inside at all.
When you have finished your treatment, use the treatment we mentioned for hot swellings that occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, then she should descend into astringent water and use the rest of the treatment.
I witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again, and the other fetus also died. After a long time, a swelling appeared in her abdomen and swelled until it opened and began to suppurate. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close. I applied some strong drawing ointments to it, and a bone came out of the place, then after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, since the abdomen is a place without bone, so I estimated that it was from the bones of the dead fetus. I searched the wound and extracted many bones from the head of the fetus. I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like that for a while, suppurating a little from the place. I have brought this rare case here because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven: images of the instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Image of a spiral used to open the mouth of the uterus:
This binder, which is used to straighten books, similarly has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder, and should be made of either ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers, and their edge about a finger, and their length a span and a half. وفى وسط الخشبتين رائدان من جنس الخشبة نفسها قد أوثقتا فيهما يكون طولهما نصف شبر او أكثر قليلا وعرضهما نحو أصبعين او أكثر قليلا.
And these two projections are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the two screws; a picture of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two projections at its end, as you see. طول كلّ رائد منهما نحو شبر وعرضهما أصبعان.
If you want to open the cervix with it, sit the woman on a bed with her legs dangling and spread apart. ثمّ أدخل هذين الرائدين ضمومين فى فم الرحم وأنت ماسك طرف الآلة أسفل بين فخذيها.
Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients:
Picture of the instrument with which the fetus is pushed:
Picture of the perforator with which the head of the fetus is perforated:
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see.
And it may be made rectangular like hooks in this form as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and file with it.
Picture of a cannon also:
Picture of a fishing hook:
This hook should have some thickness so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it.
Picture of a hook with two barbs:
Picture of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus:
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his status among people.
So do not disdain to have any instrument prepared. فلا بدّ من الحاجة اليها،
Chapter seventy-eight on expelling the placenta
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with pellitory, and tightly cover her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out with this, fine; otherwise, take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid. Place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as rue, oregano, dill, chamomile, wormwood, savin, and centaury. Use all these medicines or some of them, submerge them in water, and put the pot on the fire. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot's lid, with the other end in the cervix, and hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus. Then make her sneeze as we said, and the placenta will come out quickly.
If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in rose oil or marshmallow extract, then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it gently, little by little, until it comes out.
If it is adhered deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described until you find the placenta. Then pull it gently, little by little, taking care lest the uterus prolapses with strong pulling. Rather, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the pulling force; it will then respond and detach from the adhesion.
If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of being rough with her in pulling again. But you should tie what has come out of it, at the cervix, to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the quadruple ointment. It will rot it after a few days, and it will dissolve and come out. However, if it rots, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient. So, it is necessary to use suitable fumigation for this, and some of the ancients have tried fumigation with garden cress and dried figs.
Picture of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in case of retention of menses, placenta, and the like:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel. او تصنع من نحاس
The thin end is placed in the vagina. والطرف الواسع على النار
You hold it until that incense is gone. وتعيد غيره
Chapter seventy-nine on the treatment of unperforated hemorrhoids.
Many boys may be born with their anuses not perforated, having been blocked by a thin membrane. فينبغى للقابلة أن تثقب ذلك الصفاق بأصبعها.
Then she should put on it cotton dipped in wine and oil. ثمّ تعالجه بالمراهم حتّى يبرأ،
If you fear that it will close up, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
Blockage of the anus may also occur from the healing of a wound or a swelling. فينبغى أن يشقّ ذلك الاندمال ثمّ يعالج بما ذكرنا من العلاج والرصا ص،
Chapter eighty on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body).
Fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus from the outside or in the perineum from one of the sides, and the fistula may be single or multiple.
If this thickening becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it, and some of these fistulas may penetrate to the anus and to the intestine, and some may not be penetrating.
The penetrating ones can be recognized by the feces and gas that come out of them when the patient defecates, and sometimes worms come out of them.
And some of these fistulas, if they are in the perineum, may penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra, and some of them may penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from a non-penetrating one is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron if the fistula is not curved. If it is curved, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, gas, or worms comes out of the hole, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed with the treatment.
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the evidence for this is the exit of urine from it and its resistance to healing with medicines.
And if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the coccyx, the sign of this is the arrival of the probe there, if there is no curvature to the bone, and the presence of pain in that area, and the constant discharge of pus from it, and that no treatment is effective on it, and it does not heal with ointment.
All these penetrating fistulas are incurable, and their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant doctors who attempt to treat them.
As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, there is hope for their healing with iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced.
This is that you lay the patient before you on his back and raise his legs up and his thighs inclined towards his abdomen, then you insert the copper or lead probe if there is curvature in the fistula until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus. If you feel in your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, exposed, without feeling any peritoneum or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not bother with it, for it is incurable, as we have said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely.
And among the treatments that are hoped to be beneficial is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat it two or three times until you know that all the excess thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather has been burned. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments. If it heals, then good, otherwise it will never heal with any other treatment.
But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or peritoneum between it and the probe, and you see the fistula next to the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula while you pass through the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach the incision where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then clean out the thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather, leaving nothing of it, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.
If the bleeding overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best thing you can do and the quickest benefit is to cauterize it with fire or with a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh, stopping the bleeding, and drying the moisture. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat or powdered sulfur with oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with healing ointments that generate solid flesh, which are medicines that have astringency and dryness. For if it heals, it is cured, and do not fear recurrence.
If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and search with it. If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetrating, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation, and that is to use one of three methods in it:
Either cauterize it as we have said,
or incise it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the wicks and treatment closely, and do not go too far with the incision so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to have involuntary defecation. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we have said,
or penetrate that barrier and pierce it after incising it near the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with another sharp-tipped instrument. Then clean all the thickened flesh in the incision as far as you can thoroughly. Then close the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening until it seals, and leave the fistula open inside the anus, so it will be easier for the patient.
And the fistula may be perforated in this manner: if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the rim of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler's needle in this way: وأدخل فيها خيطا مفتولا من خمسة خيوط او نحوها
If it is perforated in the edge of the anus from inside nearby, then bring the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bring out the end of the thread and gather both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two.
Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is cut and falls off.
Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, unless it is very deep, then you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it.
Then do with it as we mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised, its curvature is very sharp and the other side is not sharp so that you do not cut with it what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one on the perforation of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters, or like grapes, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly, and they are single and multiple, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly dry, with yellow water or a little blood flowing constantly from them, and they are the color of the skin.
And the treatment of what is inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus comes out and the warts appear to you, then you quickly hook them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots.
If the hooks do not hold in them because of their moisture and looseness, then scrape them with a rough cloth or a piece of rough bread or pull them with your fingers, then cut them, then sprinkle on them after cutting some sharp powders so that it takes the place of cauterization or cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not respond to coming out, then inject the patient with an enema that has a little sting to wash what is in the anus and it will come out quickly when the patient strains.
As for the warts outside the anus, their matter is easy and simple, which is that you take them with your fingernail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them with what we mentioned until they heal.
And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is appropriate to use piercing them in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle, then pull the wart up and pierce it with the needle at its root from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is crossed, and tighten the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the warts and leave one of them unpierced so that the excess blood flows from it.
Then put on the anus a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerotti and put it on the anus and order the patient to rest, then leave it until they fall, and if the warts fall, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, it often occurs from dryness of the stool and constipation, so if it becomes chronic and no medicine works on it, it is appropriate to scrape it with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents it from healing is removed, then treat it until it heals as it should.
If it does not heal, then repeat scraping it more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it, and it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two on the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and corns.
A corn is a round knot, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, that forms throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the corn and grasped with tweezers or a hook and removed from its root, then treated.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter.
As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, dense, round protuberance on the surface of the body, and frequently occurs on the hands of children.
Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. وإن شئت كويته على ما تقدّم بالنار او بالدواء الحادّ،
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument that I mentioned in the treatment of moles.
As for a mole, it is also a small, dense, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep, and if cold affects it, one feels in it something similar to the sting of ants, and it occurs throughout the body, mostly on the hands.
Its treatment is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong eagle feather, and place that tube on the mole until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the mole and make it go deep into the flesh, and the mole will be removed from its root.
And if you wish, you can do that with a copper or iron tube in this manner.
The top of the tube to the thin part should be solid and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to hold and twist it.
And if you wish, cauterize the fistula as described previously in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter eighty-three on images of the instruments that use cupping glasses in diseases of the anus, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or of Chinese porcelain, or of cast or hammered copper.
And this instrument can be made small and large, according to those who use it. فتكون التى تستعمل فى علاج الصبيان الصغار صغارا
And those whose anuses are narrow or painful, their syringes should be very gentle.
Picture of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, where the wineskin is attached, should be wide in this manner. له حاجز حيث يربط الزقّ كما ترى.
And its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid, very smooth, and thin; on one of its sides are two holes and on the other side is one hole. تكون سعة الثقب على غلظ المرود او أغلظ قليلا.
And the wineskin, in which you put the medications, should be made from an animal bladder or from thin sheepskin, made in the shape of a small round tablecloth, its diameter a span, pierced with many holes all around.
And the distance between each hole should be the width of a finger, then you insert into those holes a strong thread of two-ply yarn of ten strands or so. وتجمع به الزقّ كالسفرة فإذا وضع فيه الدواء شدّ فى رأس المحقن بين الحجرين شدّا وثيقا ثمّ تحقن به،
And this is a picture of the circle of the wineskin and the hole:
The method of enema is to fill the leather or bladder with the medication, warmed to a degree the patient can tolerate. واحذر أن يكون حارّا جدّا او باردا جدّا
Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs up, and a mat or blanket is placed under him.
Then the tip of the enema syringe is lubricated with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar. ثمّ تدخله فى المقعدة برفق.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medication stimulates him to defecate, he should hold it as long as he can. وإن نام به الليل كلّه كان أبلغ فى المنغعة، فإن حقن به فى علل الإسهال واستعجل خروجه فلتعد الحقنة حتّى يبرأ.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, the syringe should be very smooth, smoother than the syringes used for children. This is a picture of a smooth syringe with its leather tightly stretched:
Chapter eighty-four on the treatment of wounds/injuries/surgeries.
I have mentioned in the division of the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I mention here their treatment by hand and with medicines to perfection, so I say that wounds vary according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the place where the wound occurs, so the things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone or a cut from a sword or a knife, or a stab from a spear, a stick, or an arrow, and so on from many things.
As for the wounds according to the places of the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measurement and a law for all other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because the complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that whenever a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no bone fracture, you should look, and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and it has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling on the patient, then hasten and bleed him on the spot, and do not delay that, and draw blood from him according to his strength if there is no impediment to bleeding, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is slight, and let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded area, and warn the patient against fullness, drink, and coarse foods.
If there is an impediment to bleeding him, let him reduce his food, and not approach meat or drinks.
And apply to the wound, if a hot swelling occurs in it, cotton dipped in rose oil alone or with the drink that has astringency.
And if you are safe from the hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe to you shortly.
But if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it until it draws pus, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not meet with the bandages, then join it with sutures as I describe in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its hold is only in a small attachment, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that repair solid flesh in it instead of the skin, and order the patient to eat foods that have firmness, such as heads, porridges, and the like.
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and it does not stick to the bone, cut off all the putrefied part and discard it, then treat it.
If in these wounds there is an artery or a vein bleeding from it, and the blood has not stopped with the medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it, and if necessary, if what we mentioned does not help, cauterize it until the blood stops, and if these wounds are small and simple, then their matter is easy and simple, it is sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding before the air changes them.
The recipe for the powder is that one part of frankincense is taken, two parts of mastic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime, all are crushed and sifted, and the wound is packed with it, and it is tied tightly until it adheres to it well and clots with the blood, then you tie it from above with bandages and leave it, do not loosen it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not come off it until it heals.
And that lime alone may do it if you do not have frankincense and mastic, and it may also do this action by itself in many large wounds if its placement on it and its tightening are mastered, and the wounds are fresh with their blood as long as the air has not changed them.
But if the air has changed it somewhat, especially if it is in the summer time, then there is no meaning in putting this powder, so treat it as we mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments to it, or applying a porridge of barley flour made with water and honey until it draws pus, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is slight, then pull it with the forceps.
I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what is to be resumed.
In neck surgery,
If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple, but if it has cut a nerve or an artery from the neck, and if it is a nerve, there is no way but to avoid treating it with what constricts severely, such as verdigris, vitriol, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm, and nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs, and what you treat it with should be of emollient medicines such as quicklime washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or with rose oil, and tutty if it is also washed with fresh water, and all other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, use sutures or join its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a pocket has occurred in its bottom where pus has collected, then drain it in the lowest place in it.
If an artery has been cut in the wound and you find its blood bleeding, then sever it or tie it or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has cut some or all of the cartilage of the larynx, and the jugular veins are safe, then join the edges of the skin with sutures over the trachea, and do not touch the larynx, but straighten it and return it to its natural shape, then tighten it tightly and leave it for days, then treat it with ointments that have astringency and drying until it heals.
If the wound has affected the bone, then examine it, and if there are bone fragments in it, then extract them all or what is possible of them, and what you cannot, leave it until the wound putrefies and heals and its removal becomes easy.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that we described, and if bone putrefies in the wound and becomes a fistula, then treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter.
In surgery of the chest and between the shoulders,
If it is a stab wound from a spear or a knife, and you see that it has depth, then look, and if air comes out of it when the patient breathes, then know that it is a fatal wound, and if it has no depth and is fresh with its blood, then do not put the powder in it at first glance, and do not tighten it so that the blood does not get trapped in its depth and recoil to the heart and kill the patient, but put in it an attractive ointment and loosen it twice a day, and if you do not have an ointment, then put worn cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it of moisture, and let the patient sleep on the wound so that what collects in it flows out.
And if three days or more have passed for the wound, and the patient has not experienced any convulsions, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe, so treat it with bandaging and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If its healing is difficult and it constantly suppurates, then know that it has become a fistula, so treat it according to its chapter.
And if time has passed for the wound of the chest or back, treat it with what has been mentioned of suturing if it is large, or with the powder if it is small.
If it has affected the bone and cut off fragments from it, then examine the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are free, and if they are not free, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for it will make their removal easier.
As for the rest of the wounds occurring in the rest of the organs, their rule in treatment is the rule of what we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five on wounds of the abdomen, protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The hernia that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or medium. From a large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, making their insertion and suturing more difficult and laborious.
The small hernia can also be difficult in another way, so its reduction is necessarily more difficult, and if the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its insertion difficult. For this reason, the medium hernia is the best, because the reduction of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types: two common sutures are suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body, and the other two are specific sutures that apply to all other wounds, except that they are more specific to suturing the abdomen, and I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification.
So I say that if the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out and its reduction is difficult, it is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the hernia, as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by the cold air. If this is the case, it should be warmed by immersing a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone or in which has been cooked zedoary, costus, and spikenard, and dabbing the intestine with it until the swelling subsides. This can also be done with a drink that has astringency, which is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
When you see that the swelling has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which marsh mallow or hollyhock has been cooked, for this will facilitate its entry with the easiest effort.
If its return is difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the hernia with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision, and one is only compelled to make the incision after necessity and the failure of other means.
This is a picture of the instrument:
Its one curved side is limited, its other side is unlimited, and the thin end is not as thin as a scalpel but rather slightly blunt, and it is a tool that resembles a small probe, as you see.
So, if the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape and proper place if you are able to do so, for that is best.
However, if the rupture is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper abdomen, he should place his head and chest higher than his lower body, and likewise, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your intention and purpose to have the side where the surgery is higher than the other side.
And thus, it should be used in major surgeries and in medium surgeries.
But in small surgeries, you place it according to what is possible for you.
Then you bring before you a gentle servant who holds the entire rupture with his hands and brings its edges together, then reveals it to the one in charge of stitching bit by bit.
And this is the description of the single common stitch, which is that you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leave from the edge of the rupture a space the thickness of the little finger, and insert a single needle without threading it into the edges of the skin along with the edges of the peritoneum that is under the skin from the inside until you pass it through from that side, having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers.
Then you tighten with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are brought together tightly.
Then you also leave a space the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, then attach it to the thread as you did with the first needle, and continue doing this with the needles you need until you finish stitching the entire wound.
And let the needles be medium between thick and thin, because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are also difficult to insert into the skin, therefore, they should be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate to insert the needle into the edge of the skin too close, lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals, nor should you stitch too far apart, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then you cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while he sleeps, and you make for him supports from pieces of linen on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles, and you leave them until you know that the wound has healed.
This type of stitching with needles is thus more suitable in small surgeries, because it may be sufficient to stitch them with one needle or two or so.
As for the description of the second common stitch, it is that you gather with the stitching the four edges, I mean the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle containing a twisted thread, moderate in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, you return the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread lies intertwined from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of the small sacks with which goods are tied, and you make between each stitch and stitch a distance the thickness of the little finger, and this stitching is known by all people.
With this stitching, I stitched a surgery that occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the surgery was more than a span, and about two spans of his middle intestine had come out, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen, so I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered, and he lived after that many years, managing all his affairs, and the doctors had judged that he would never recover.
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there was nothing of the medicines, so I would put worn cotton on the wound twice a day and I would wash it with honey water until it healed.
The summary of the description of this stitching is that you stitch like furriers stitch furs, by stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side until you finish.
As for the second type of special stitching that Galen also mentioned, these are his words verbatim, which is that you stitch it like some of the healers stitch it, by bringing together each part to its similar counterpart naturally, so they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and that is as I describe to you.
It is appropriate that you insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum closest to you from the outside and pass it through to the inside in it alone and leave the two edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again and pass it from inside to outside in the other edge of the peritoneum that is on the opposite side.
And this type of stitching is better than the easy common stitching, which is the stitching that was mentioned previously.
These are Galen's words verbatim.
And some have said that stitching the abdomen may be straightened with two needles, which is that you insert a single thread in them, and you begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it through to the other side, and you insert the other needle from the opposite side, so you pass it through from your side, like the stitching of bishops, alike.
And know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than other places of the abdomen.
As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other surgeries, which is that if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you have returned the intestine and stitched it and tightened it, then apply to it the healing powders. But if the air has changed the wound, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum heals, then treat it as you treat all other surgeries until it heals.
But if you do not have medicines, apply worn cotton to it from the time it begins to suppurate and change it twice a day, as I have informed you, until it heals, for you will not need another treatment in most cases if the surgeries are simple.
If you fear that the major organs will share in the pain of the wound, it is appropriate that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit.
If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, then inject him with a lukewarm black astringent syrup, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has become a wound penetrating its cavity.
And know that whatever of the intestines is thick is easier to heal, and whatever of them is thin is more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from any surgery that occurs in it at all, because of the abundance of veins in it and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve.
But if what protruded from the wound is the omentum, and you find it fresh, then return it just as you returned the intestine.
But if some time has passed and it has become green or black, it is appropriate that you tie it with a thread above the place where it has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum.
Then you cut what is below that ligature and make the ends of the thread hanging from below the surgery, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.
Mention of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
But if a small rupture occurs in the intestine, it may be repaired in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind came out, so I began to treat him although I did not hope for his recovery, but I continued to treat him gently until he recovered and the place healed.
When I saw that the place had healed, I feared that something bad would happen to the patient in his abdomen, but nothing bad happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of his conditions, healthy, eating, drinking, having intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising in his service.
And some of the experienced have mentioned that whenever a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be stitched in this manner, which is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, then an ant with its mouth open is placed on the edges of the wound, and when it grips it and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it will stick and not come undone.
Then another ant is placed near the first, and you continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and stitch the wound, for those heads will remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm will occur to the patient at all.
It may also be possible to stitch the intestine with the thin thread that is pulled from the intestine of the animal attached to it after it is inserted into a needle, which is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine and pulled gently, then a thin twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle with the intestine's thread in it, and the intestine is stitched with it, then returned to the cavity.
And this type of stitching with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the rupture is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it and no healing from it at all.
Chapter eighty-six on the treatment of colds and fistulas.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly suppurates without ceasing, is called in general, in any organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it zakam.
And the fistula is in reality a hard, white, solidified knot without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather, and therefore some have called it a feather.
And it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be abundant or little, thick or thin.
And I have already presented in the section on wounds that every ulcer that does not heal and in which no flesh grows is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its lips that prevents the growth of good flesh, or because it is full of damage and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that suppurates it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a peculiarity in the town, as happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of swellings is slow by nature, or because there is one bone or several bones in it.
And I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the section, and it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistula and zakam, which is by way of manual work.
Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, and among them are fistulas that end in large veins and arteries, or in a nerve, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestines, or in the bladder, or in a rib, or in a vertebra of the back, or in a joint of the complex joints, such as the hand and foot, and among them are those that lead to the vicinity of a vital organ, and so on.
So whatever of these fistulas are of this description, they are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance.
So if there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I have mentioned, and you hope and desire to treat them, and you want to arrive at the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula passes straight, and explore it with it.
But if there is a curvature in the fistula, then explore it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body, so it slips in easily and bends towards the curvature.
And if the fistula has many openings that you cannot trace with the probe, then inject one of its openings, for the moisture that you inject into it will pass towards the other openings and flow from them, then complete the examination in any way possible for you to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is one fistula with many openings, and ascertain all of that with the extent of your ability by inquiring of the patient about the presence of pain when you press your hand on the place, and so on, from the signs and causes incidental to the swelling.
So if you have ascertained all of that with certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you look, and if the fistula is apparent and near, or in a healthy place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what I have previously described, and extract what is in it of solidified matter, corrupted flesh, excess flesh, and what grows in its opening of flesh, or wart, and so on, and treat it until it heals.
But if the fistula is deep-bottomed and straight, then you should incise it in depth as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh, then use threads soaked in sharp medicines and insert them into the bottom of the fistula that you reach with the iron.
Do that to it several times until that sharp medicine eats away all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption, then treat it with ointments that grow healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what has been previously described.
And if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and that is confirmed to you, then examine it and incise it as I have told you, unless you are prevented by an obstacle of a vein or nerve or vital organ, as we have said.
And if the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals.
And if it does not heal and suppurates as it used to do, then know that you have not reached all of the eradication of the corruption, so expose all of it again, and complete its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.
If it heals, otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep recess of corruption. Expose all of what is on it again, and fully scrape it and cleanse it with your best effort if the corrupted bone was a small bone and you were able to pull it, pull it with the gentle hooks that are suitable for that. If there were many bones, try to pull them all and don't leave anything from it with your best effort. If something from the ligaments obstructs you before it, and there's no danger in cutting it, then cut those ligaments and the flesh, if it is there, and free the bones.
If you can't extract the bones at your time, then apply to the wound what putrefies it, and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. Keep the wound from healing, the incision that you made during your work. Rather, put on it, if you fear that, cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in the Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments putrefy and the bones become bare, it will be easy to extract and pull them.
And if it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what is corrupted of it is only its surface, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption are gone, then dress the wound.
But if what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you about a zakam that occurred to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and an aid in your treatment.
And this repetition in his operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his low tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he used to have at all times, from excessive vomiting, a bad faint. So he recovered completely, and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and he was not afflicted in walking with any harm that would harm him at all.
And if a protruding bone in a place of the body is broken, then it is necessary to saw it in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone and order someone to pull it upwards, and make another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, then tie it to the flesh that is under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is pulled downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place that you want to saw so that the saw does not harm the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board under the bone from below tightly, because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.
And the sawing should be a little above the place of the corruption, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone, so it does not appear on its surface to the senses, and you are forced to saw it again.
And if the bone is corrupted and not protruding, but connected to each other, and the corruption is in its middle or in some of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the wood from below, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is, and when you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little away from the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in a joint, you cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no solution but scraping.
And if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, then the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and cleanse it in any way you can, and by any trick that is right for you, as long as you are not obstructed by a vein or nerve.
And know that the cutters and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their erection, their thickness and thinness, their largeness and smallness, their hardness and porosity, therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work a tool similar to that work.
And know that the works themselves may guide you to the type of tool that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various types of diseases may deduce for himself similar tools for each disease. And I have illustrated for you at the end of this chapter several tools that you may take as examples to follow and as a measure to compare with others, God willing. صورة منشار:

Chapter eighty-seven on the amputation of limbs and sawing of bones
The extremities may rot, either from an external cause or from an internal cause.
If you treat this corruption with medical treatment and the treatment does not succeed, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it, then it is necessary to amputate that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction that is greater than the loss of the limb.
And the sign of whoever is afflicted with this is that the limb blackens until you think that fire has burned it, or it rots after blackening until that rot spreads to what is next to that limb and takes over the whole body, so hasten to amputate it.
And likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some vermin, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, then amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in both bones of the forearm.
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the forearm, then amputate the forearm at the elbow in the joint itself.
If the corruption has passed and you see that it has taken hold towards the shoulder, then do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatment according to the ability.
And likewise you do with the foot if the corruption has taken hold in the toe, then amputate the toe at one of the phalanges.
And if it has taken hold in the metatarsal of the foot, then amputate the entire foot. فإن صعد الى الركبة فاقطع الساق عند مفصل الركبة،
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death.
The method of amputating or dissecting the limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you want to amputate and tie another bandage above the place, and an assistant stretches one bandage downwards and another assistant stretches the upper bandage upwards, and you strip the flesh between the two bandages with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or dissected.
And it is necessary to place linen rags on all sides so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, causing the patient additional pain and a hot swelling.
If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some blood-stopping powders, then return to your treatment until you are finished, then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you an example of a man who suffered in his leg this very same condition that I am describing to you, and that is that blackness occurred in his leg with a burning sensation resembling fire, and that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took over the entire foot, so the man, on his own initiative, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he was experiencing, amputated it at the joint and recovered.
Then, after a long time had passed, this same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand, so he came to me and I tried to stop that excess with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleaning his body, but the excess was not deterred and it began to spread to the other finger until the corruption took hold in the hand, so he called on me to amputate his hand, but I refused him, hoping to stop that excess and also fearing death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing.
So when he despaired of me, he returned to his town, and I heard about him that he, on his own initiative, amputated his entire hand and recovered.
I have only told this story to be a help in what occurs of this type of disease and to be a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter eighty-eight on the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medications.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy member and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then bursts or is lanced and all the pus within it comes out and the place remains empty like a vessel, and the skin on it, like a rag, has thinned, and its corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament, for this reason it deserves to be called a 'hidden' (mukhaba'), and it is not called a fistula unless its duration lengthens until the corruption affects something from these members, then at that time it is called a fistula or zakama.
And its treatment is to cut that whole skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption. But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption in it has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an injection.
And that is, you look at the hidden (mukhaba'), and if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor, inject it with the Egyptian medicine which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel, and cooked on the fire until the medicine thickens and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take your need of it, and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the hidden (mukhaba') and bind its mouth and leave the medicine in it for about two hours, then remove it by squeezing, do this for days until the hidden (mukhaba') is cleansed and the foul odor goes away.
It may be injected with ash water if you don't have this medicine available.
And that is, you take the ash of vine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water on it, then filter it and inject it with it until you are certain that the hidden (mukhaba') has been washed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then inject him with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed, or inject him with honey and wine mixed, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine adheres to the hidden (mukhaba'), especially if the wine has extra astringency and dryness.
So if you do that several times, and you are certain that the corruption of the hidden (mukhaba') has gone, inject it with something that grows flesh in it, such as taking some of the palm ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we established in the article on ointments.
If the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') is narrow, not accommodating the tube of the syringe, then widen it slightly with iron or place in it a wick soaked in the Egyptian ointment or the siryqun ointment until it widens. Likewise, if the mouth is too wide, then gather its lips with stitching, leaving of it just enough for the syringe to enter, no more. Likewise, if its mouth from which pus flows is elevated upwards, then slit it in its lowest place so that the pus flows downwards, because if the pus is congested in the depth of the hidden (mukhaba') it prevents flesh from growing in it. If you cannot slit the hidden (mukhaba') towards its bottom as you want, then you must position the limb so that the pus flows easily from it according to what is possible for you, and be sure that no pus is retained in it at all.
As for the healing medicines that are placed on the hidden (mukhaba') externally and how to place them on it, it is that you take one of the healing ointments appropriate to what you want and spread it on a linen cloth, and let the cloth be as large as will cover the entire hidden (mukhaba'). Then cut with scissors opposite the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') a hole slightly wider than the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'). Then spread some of the soft ointments on another cloth the size of the hole and place it on it, placed away from the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba') to facilitate the exit of pus from it, and do not remove the large cloth except after several days.
As for the one on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), it is the one that you remove every time, so that the pus gathered in it comes out, and so you know what flows from it of pus, whether it is much or little, or mature or immature.
And with this also, inspect the site of the hidden (mukhaba') itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it or there is no swelling in it.
So if your treatment proceeds in this way, and you see that the substance that comes out is slight on the mouth of the hidden (mukhaba'), then know that the hidden (mukhaba') has adhered or is close to adhering, so then loosen it tomorrow or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment.
If thin pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after a long time, do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, because among people some have slow flesh growth in their wounds and some the opposite of that.
If immature pus comes out of the hidden (mukhaba') after many days, know that the hidden (mukhaba') has not adhered. If the adherence of the hidden (mukhaba') is slow and its matter prolonged, increase the drying of the medicines, and let the medicines be moist in their consistency and dry in their potency, such as the palm ointment if an extra amount of qalqatar has been added to it.
And among the most effective things that it is treated with is that the palm ointment is taken and dissolved with rose oil and the aged wine, moderate in its consistency, is sprinkled on it, then you knead it with it and use it.
And a similar action may be done, if the palm ointment is not available to you, with honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it, or you take myrrh, aloe and frankincense, and grind all of it and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire, then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the hidden (mukhaba'), or spread on it honey that you've cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle the drugs on it, and place the cloth on it and bind it.
And long ziravand, the root of the German iris, cress flour and centaury may be used in such a case, whether you use them singly or combined, you grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey I described and use it.
If the matter of the hidden (mukhaba') is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth and it has affected the bones or the rest of the hard nerves or ligaments, so treat it with the treatment of the fistula as described above.
Chapter eighty-nine on the treatment of felon, bruised nail, and amputation. الأصبع الزائدة وشق التحام الأصابع
The felon is a lot of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it grows in the rest of the fingers. If it is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, it swells with a hot swelling, or it becomes badly corrupted until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps it spoils it all. Perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes livid. So if you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then you should cut with iron all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound after that, for cauterization in this is very beneficial.
But if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the containing corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and made it sting and hurt it, then you should put a thin probe under the corner of the nail that stings the flesh and lift it up and cut that flesh gently and put on what remains of the flesh of the burning corrosive medicines until it all goes away, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the corruption has affected the bone, then you should cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone in it at all.
If you see the erosion and corruption running in the finger, then cut it in one of the phalanges as mentioned previously, then treat it until it heals.
If the nail is struck or bruised and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to phlebotomize the patient first, then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh under the nail with the incision, for you will cause severe pain to the patient and it will be a reason for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the place with something that soothes the pains.
As for the extra finger that is generated in some people's hands, perhaps it is all fleshy, and perhaps some of it has bones, and perhaps it has a nail, and some of it grows at the base of the joint of some fingers, or it grows in some of the phalanges of the finger. The one that grows in some of the phalanges of the finger does not move, and the one that grows at the joint of the finger may move. So what is fleshy, cutting it is easy, and that is to cut it at its root with a wide scalpel. But the one that grows at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it.
As for the one that grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first be cut flesh, a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that, then treat it until it heals.
As for the adhesion that occurs to the fingers with each other, this often happens, and this is something that a person is born with, and it happens when a wound heals, or a burn from fire, and so on. It is necessary to incise that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form, then put between them wicks or rags soaked in rose oil so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them, or put between them a thin sheet of lead until the place heals as it should.
Likewise, if the adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then incise that adhesion according to what is feasible and what corrects the shape of the member.
Chapter ninety on severing varicose veins.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black residues that occur in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, especially in porters, donkey drivers, and laborers.
First, one should use strong shaking of the body from black bile several times, then bleed the basilic vein.
As for its treatment with iron, it is of two types: one is to incise and extract the black blood, and the other is to extract the vein entirely.
As for incising it, it is done in this way: first, the leg is bathed with very hot water until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then the patient's leg is tied from above his thigh to below his knee with a turban, then the vein is incised in one, two, or three wide incisions, then the black blood is extracted by hand from the bottom of the leg upwards and from top to bottom until the amount of blood that you see sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate is extracted, then it is bandaged and the patient is instructed to avoid foods that produce black bile, and the purging and bleeding are repeated whenever the veins become full and that harms the patient.
As for extracting it, it is done in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it has a lot of hair, then he enters the bath and his leg is bathed with hot water until it reddens and the vein swells, or he exercises vigorously if he does not have a bath until the limb warms up.
Then the skin opposite the vein is incised lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel, then the skin is opened with hooks and the vein is skinned from all sides until it is exposed to the touch, and when it appears, you see it bright red, and when it is free from the skin, you see it also like a tendon.
Then a probe is inserted under it until it rises and emerges from the skin, then it is hung with a smooth, blunt hook.
Then another incision is made near that incision about three fingers wide, then the skin is peeled off the vein until it appears. ثمّ ارفعه بالمرود كما فعلت وعلّقه بصنّارة أخرى كما فعلت أوّلا،
Then make another incision or many incisions if you need to.
Then pull it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when all of it comes out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe under it and twist it with your hand in every direction until it comes out, and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it and it will cause harm to the patient.
When you have extracted all of it, put wool dipped in wine and rose oil or oil on the wounds and treat it until it heals.
If the varicose vein is convulsive, with curves and twists in different directions, and not straight as we have said, then it is necessary to incise it at each of its curves and twists, then hang it with hooks until you extract it entirely.
Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will make it difficult for you to extract it, so be very careful.
Image of the hook with which the varicose vein is incised:

It should not have a curvature like other hooks. ولا تكون حادّة الطرف لئلّا تجرح العرق
And it should be thick at the bend, smooth, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein/vessel with its thinness. بل يكون لها فضل غلظ كما قلنا

And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body other than the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, bottle gourds, and the worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg. ثمّ يتنفّط الموضع.
So when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead, whose weight is from one dirham to two dirhams. وتعقده وتترك الرصاص معلّقا من الساق.
So whenever something comes out of it, wrap it in the lead and tie it. فإن طال كثيرا فاقطع بعضه ولفّ الباقى.
Therefore, it should be handled gently and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, in some people, may come out what is five cubits and ten in length. وقد بلغنى أنّه خرج لرجل من عشرين شبرا.
If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole. وبطّه بطّا طويلا مع البدن حتّى يتفرّغ كلّ ما فيه من مادّة.
And this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself. فيحدث له أفواه كثيرة ويخرج من كلّ فم شعبة.
So treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.
Chapter ninety-two on the incision on the worms generated under the smallpox called the disease of cattle
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle.
It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps in the whole body, ascending and descending, becoming apparent to the sense when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces a place in the skin and comes out.
And its formation is from the putrefaction of some of the humors, as happens to worms, snakes, and حب القرع (probably a type of skin eruption or growth) in the belly.
And what is expected of its harm is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often.
So, if you want to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it creeps and appears to the sense, so you should tie what is above it and below it with a good tight bandage, then cut over it and remove it.
If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cauterization with fire to the place until you burn it.
And the greatest thing that is expected is its corruption of the eye, as we have said, so if you see that it has gone to the head near the eye, then tie tightly under it on the forehead, then cut over it and take it out.
And it is necessary that the sick person take care to purify his body with medicines that purge the putrid, bad humors and be cautious of foods that generate putrefaction.
Chapter ninety-three, on incising the illness that is known as an abscess.
This disease, which is called "al-nafir" in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the limbs, then moves from one limb to another, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was called to a sick woman in one of the rural areas, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of the forearm, and after an hour passed I saw that swelling crawling along the ulna as a worm crawls, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as could be, like mercury when it flows from place to place.
So the pain went away from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout the body until it went into the other arm.
Then she told me that it goes around her whole body as I saw, so I marveled at the speed of its movement from limb to limb, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner except that I saw a group of people who experience the pain moving from limb to limb, but I hadn't seen it with my own eyes like I saw it in this woman. I did not estimate that except that it must be because the woman was from the Bedouins, having a dry body and exposed veins, so from this, that moving wind became apparent to the senses, and it necessarily does not appear in this manner in those of comfort with moist bodies and hidden veins.
So if you want to treat it and its possessor feels the pain, if it appears to you visibly as we mentioned, then tie tightly above it and below it with haste and incise upon it until that trapped wind comes out and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with that which expels the winds and disperses them, such as asafoetida seeds and sagapenum seeds and similar medications.
Chapter ninety-four on removing arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places in which they are located in the body.
As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, and there are hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three corners and four corners, and some have tongues and some have splinters.
As for those that are according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two types: either the organs are from the main hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. فمتى وقع سهم فى أحد هذه الأعضاء وظهرت لك علامات الموت التى أنا واصفها لك بعد فينبغى أن تجتنب إخراج ذلك السهم منها فإنّ الموت يلحق صاحبها فى أكثر الأحوال،
And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow hits it and penetrates the bone and wounds the peritoneum which is on the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, nausea, dizziness, redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is cut off and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound and a liquid like the water of the flesh flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out.
As for the signs of the arrow if it hits the heart and is close to the left breast and feels as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty, and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and this is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting, then know that death is certainly coming.
And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels which are next to the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and asks to inhale cold air.
If the arrow hits the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs, and the breathing is great with severe pain and sighing, and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow hits the liver, severe pain follows, and blood comes out of the wound which resembles the liver in its redness.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound, and the matter is clear.
And if the arrow hits the abdomen and is stuck in it and something from the stool, or the fat, or an intestine which has been perforated comes out of the wound, then there is no hope in treating it or in removing the arrow.
If the arrow is in the bladder and the urine comes out and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain intensifies on the patient, then know that he is doomed.
As for the other organs, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and the like of the organs, they are usually saved when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from that your treatment.
That is, an arrow had hit a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose, so I removed it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he healed and no harm occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow for a Jew that had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden, and I only reached the small end that adheres to the wood, and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the compound bow, square iron, smooth, and there were no barbs on it, so the Jew healed and no bad incident occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one, which is the one that has two barbs, so I made an incision on him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat, so I gently handled it until I removed it, and the Christian was saved and healed.
And I removed another arrow from a man who had been hit in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it, but when he remained for thirty days or so and nothing changed in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and maneuvered it and removed it, and he healed and no bad incident occurred.
And I saw a man who had been hit by an arrow in his back, and the wound healed over him, but when it was after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman who had been hit by an arrow in her abdomen, and the wound healed and the arrow remained, and nothing changed in her condition, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural actions.
And I saw another man who had been hit by an arrow in his face, and the wound healed and he felt little pain from it.
And many are like this.
And I tell you how to remove some arrows so that you make that a measure and a guide to what I have not mentioned, because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor can a book encompass them, but rather the skillful craftsman measures by the little on the much and by what is present on what is absent, and he infers a new work and a new instrument when strange incidents descend from this craft.
So I say that arrows are removed from the organs in which they are stuck in two ways: either by pulling from the place from which it entered, or from the opposite direction.
And those which come out from where they entered, either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, so it is pulled and removed. If it does not respond to coming out at the time it fell, then it is necessary for you to leave it for days until the flesh around it rots so that it is easy to pull and remove it.
Similarly, if it is stuck in a bone and does not respond to coming out, then also leave it for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, then it will come out.
If it does not respond to coming out after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill until you widen it for the arrow, then pull it and remove it.
As for if the arrow has hidden in a place in the body and is hidden from feeling, then examine it with a probe. If you feel it, then pull it with some instruments that are suitable for pulling it. If you cannot do it because of the narrowness of the wound and the distance of the arrow in the depth and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then make an incision on it until the wound widens and you are able to reach the arrow until you remove it.
If it has two barbs, grasp them, then free the flesh stuck in them from every side with every trick you can do that, and endeavor, if you cannot free the flesh, to break the barbs and twist them until you are free.
And when you try to remove the arrow in whatever place it may be, then use the twisting of your hand with the forceps to all sides until you free it, and be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and it be difficult for you to pull and remove it.
If you cannot do it at your time, then leave it for days until those fleshes around it rot, then return to it, for it will be easy then. If bleeding obstructs you, then use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter.
And guard yourself from cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use a trick in every way you can free the arrow, and let that be gently, slowly, and steadily as I described to you.
And it is necessary for you, when you pull the arrow, to put the patient in the shape he was in when the arrow struck, for that is more suitable. If you cannot do that, then use whatever shapes you can.
As for the arrow which comes out from the opposite direction, either something of it has protruded to the outside, or you find the end of the arrow by feeling from above the skin near and see it protruding, so make an incision on it, and let the incision be to the extent that the forceps can fit in it, then pull it, for it is easy to come out.
If it sticks in a bone, then twist your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and widens for itself, then pull it. Otherwise, leave it for days, then return to it until it comes out.
If the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it with it. If the shaft has fallen and you want to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow is easily removed by that.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh that has become poisoned in it, if you can do that, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to what can be felt with the probe and you can make an incision on it, then make an incision and guard yourself from cutting a vein or nerve and remove it, then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.
The image of the forceps with which arrows are pulled:
Its ends are like the beak of a bird, made as if it were a file; if it grips an arrow or something, it will not let it go.
And various types of it are made, large, small, and medium, all according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Image of the hollow cannon:
Image of the solid midfagh:
This is solid at the end, like the probe, to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and pushing it.
Chapter Ninety-Five on Phlebotomy
The veins that are customarily phlebotomized in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head. العرقان النابضان اللذان خلف الأذنين المعروفان بالحسيسين والشريانان اللذان فى الصدغين الظاهران والعرقان اللذان فى مأقى العينين المعروفان بالناظرين والعرق المنتصب فى وسط الجبهة والعرق الذى فى طرف الأنف والودجان اللذان فى العنق والعرقان اللذان فى الشفة العليا من الفم والعرقان اللذان فى الشفة السفلى وهذه العروق المعروفة بالجهارك والعرقان اللذان تحت اللسان
As for the veins that are phlebotomized in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the lateral side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the Akhal, and it is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body; and the Basilic, and it is located on the medial side, and it is also called the Axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the ligament of the arm, which is located on the ulna, and it is the one that adheres to it, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb; and the Aslim, and it is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot are three veins: one of them is the one under the hollow of the knee from the lateral side; and the second is the Saphenous, and its place is at the ankle from the medial side; and the Sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel from the lateral side.
And in the other leg are three veins like it.
As for the two veins that are behind the ears, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant head ulcers.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe: that you shave the head of the sick person and rub its back in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing it well, then the sick person strangles his neck with a turban until the two veins appear, and their place is behind the ears in the two low places of the head, so you search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with ink, then you take a scalpel, which is known as the Nashal, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone, then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a severed cut, and the length of the cut is the extent of two closed fingers or so, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you tie them with bandages and leave them until they heal.
And their cutting and cauterization have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.
As for the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic migraine, severe headache, constant ophthalmia, and the flow of acute humors pouring into the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe to you: the sick person tightens his neck with a turban until the two veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulse becomes clear under your finger, then you mark with ink, then you lift the skin from above the vein up with your index finger, and you insert the Nashal scalpel from below, and you lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out the blood according to your need, then you loosen the sick person's strangulation and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then you put cotton and a bandage on it and tie it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.
And their mention, cutting, and scraping have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.
As for the phlebotomy of the forehead vein, its benefit after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and unsightly redness.
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe to you: the sick person strangles his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the Axe, and this is its picture:
You place the projecting fork that is at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar in its manner, and you let the blood flow to the extent that you desire, then you loosen the tourniquet of the sick person and tighten it until he recovers. And it may be opened with a wide lancet, except that it is not appropriate for the lancet to be sharp-tipped like other lancets, but rather be slightly wide-tipped, and you bleed it obliquely because the bone is near, so perhaps the lancet might break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, eyelashes, and diseases of the face.
And as for the way of bleeding them, it is that the sick person tightens his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing at his head, and let the bleeding be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide lancet, for the place has no flesh, so if the lancet is thin-tipped, perhaps it might break.
Then you let out the blood you need and put cotton on them and tighten them for one night, then you loosen them.
And as for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache and for diseases of the face like the red erysipelas that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic.
And the way to bleed it is that the sick person tightens his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet and insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose itself between the partitions of the nose straight, because the vein does not appear to the senses there, so the blood will come out immediately.
And it is appropriate that you deepen your hand with the lancet a little and let out the blood you need, then bandage it for a night, for it will heal quickly.
As for the two external jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that occur on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, malignant ulcers, and eating sores.
And the way of bleeding them is that the ill person tightens below them on his neck with a bandage, and the practitioner stands at the head of the sick person, and the sick person is sitting on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise with a slightly wide bleeding, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see of the need for that, then you do likewise with the other vein, then you loosen the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate tightening, lest the sick person suffocate, and you leave it until the next day, for the wound will heal.
As for the veins of the jaw, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is that it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, malignant ulcers, chapped lips, and malignant ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person in front of you and tighten his neck with a turban, then you turn his lips and look at the two veins that you see, one on the right of the lip and the other on its left, and you distinguish them by their blackness, and that is also because around them are thin black veins, so you cut them with a severed cut.
If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and clearest of them, and likewise do with the two veins that are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is for the ulcers that are in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person between your hands facing the sun and lift his tongue and look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein, and their color is blackish, so you bleed them and be careful not to go deep in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, so perhaps bleeding might occur from those arteries.
As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, they are the ones that are customarily bled in all people, and their bleeding is in two ways: either by piercing with a wide basil-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped one tending towards thinness, or by incising with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the scalpel [and this is its image].
Image of the wide basil-shaped lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this is a picture of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for phlebotomizing thin veins that contain thin, choleric blood. وهذه صورة المبضع النشل:
This is the lancet that is suitable for incision, and there are wide and thin types of it, depending on the width and narrowness of the veins, and this may be inferred from others, and it is well known among artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it and be careful of it, for beneath it is an artery, and if he makes a mistake and increases the insertion of the lancet, he will cut that artery, causing bleeding, so therefore, its phlebotomy should not be with a piercing lancet, but rather by incision with the lancet.
If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it should be avoided and another should be used, or some of its branches should be sought, or the arm's tendon should be phlebotomized in its place, for it is clear, and incise it with the lancet as we have said.
If you want to phlebotomize it specifically, then it is necessary before tightening the arm to feel the place until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink, then tie the arm and incise the vein with an oblique incision with the lancet as we said, and make sure that the strike falls away from the location of the artery.
And when you see, when tightening the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, at the time of phlebotomy, jumping as the urine of a child jumps, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the blood of the artery, so then immediately put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, as it often does, then tie the arm and leave it.
And warn the patient against neglecting it, and let it be on his neck, and let him not move it for days until he recovers.
If the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at your disposal, then sever the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and tighten it on the location of the vein tightly with a bandage and padding until the next day.
Then if the blood stops, and if not, then treat it with what was mentioned previously regarding placing the styptic powders.
And stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases because of the smallness of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, so know this.
As for the Akhal vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the Basilic vein and a branch from the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it, and if he goes too deep with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness will occur in it, which is difficult to heal, and it may not heal at all.
This nerve is often perceptible to the touch. If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision with the lancet lengthwise and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise.
As for the Cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head and is useful for eye diseases. It is recommended for this vein, especially, if you want to perform phlebotomy on it, to do it by puncturing with the olive-shaped lancet or the broad basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve underneath it, except that you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft spot.
It does not harm it if it is not hit on the first try to repeat the phlebotomy several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first try, but that swelling does not harm it at all.
As for the method of phlebotomy, its complications, and what should precede it in its preparation, the first thing you should know is that phlebotomy is either used to maintain health only or used in diseases. The one used to maintain and sustain health and to prevent the occurrence of diseases should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Akhal, and the Basilic, and the phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear, and it should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed.
As for the phlebotomy used in diseases, it has no specific time, but whenever the need and necessity for it arises, whether at night or day, at any hour and at any time.
Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.
If someone intends to have phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary to cleanse his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a lot of retained waste, so that excess putrid matter that harms the main organs is not drawn from the intestines to the veins during phlebotomy.
Do not bleed the bloated, the drunk, or the intoxicated until that condition has passed from them. Also, avoid phlebotomy immediately after fever, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental.
Then consider thinning the humors before that if the blood is thick, with foods, drinks, and medicines, if possible.
Then he should enter the bath if there is no impediment preventing him, or he should engage in some exercise so that the blood thins. And make his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have said. He should aim to clear his mind that day of all bad psychological symptoms such as worries, anger, and fear, and of all physical symptoms such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, intercourse, and so on.
And have present in his company things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainment, and so on, each person according to what they can afford.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the person being bled sits.
Then he extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the cord and twists it two or three times. The tightening should be moderate because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.
Then, after tightening, the person being bled should rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, specifically. Then he places his index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, slightly below the spot where he intends to bleed, so that the vein does not shrink and avoid the strike, because some veins are like tendons, shrinking during phlebotomy, and some are filled with air. So when you place the lancet on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. And if it does open it, the opening will be narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and take his time in all these matters.
Then he lowers the lancet. If it opens the vein on that attempt, then fine, otherwise, he should try again a little below that spot or above it quickly if the area has not swollen.
If it swells or the patient becomes distressed, leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath.
Then he can resume phlebotomy if he wishes.
If the lancet punctures and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin, and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people the area may swell at the small opening. If you see that it has swollen, do not try again at all, as it will not help you. Put some oil cake on it, as it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this place than the oil itself and all other ointments. Likewise, use oil cake in all your vein phlebotomy when the blood flow is difficult. Theriac Faruq and Shakhizaniya can also do this if either of them is placed on the area, as the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for those who have only been bled that one time or if the opening of the vein was small, then quickly place a sponge dipped in slightly warmed water and salt on the swelling and tighten it for an hour, and it will dissolve.
You should do this after the blood has completely come out from the vein itself or from another vein.
If something of blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does not harm. فإن أحببت فاحمل عليه شيئا من الصبر والمرّ المحلولين او شيئا من عصارة الفودنج ونحوه
Swelling and a bump often occur during the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, so place your hand on it, and if you find it softens when you press it, then it is a bad bump, so be careful not to put anything on it that we have mentioned because it might bleed arterial blood. But bandage it with something astringent to make the area firm, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
It is necessary to extract blood from every person according to his strength and what appears of the dominant color of the blood. For, if the blood is black, let it out until it turns red, and similarly, if you see it thick, let it out until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp until its sharpness is gone.
It is necessary for whoever is full-bodied and strong and needs to remove blood all at once to widen the phlebotomy of the vein and let the lancet be wide. And whoever is weak, then the opposite of that. It is best to extract it in rounds and to have the hole narrow.
The best way to perform phlebotomy is obliquely, angled and with an incision, not a stab.
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve, and it is better and safer than horizontal or vertical phlebotomy.
Whoever usually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to feed him before the phlebotomy some bread soaked in sour pomegranate juice or oxymel if he is hot-tempered, and let his blood out in three or four rounds. If he has a cold temperament, he should take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in a drink of water-mint or in honey drink sweetened with spices or in basil-flavored drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the loss of a large amount of blood, he should be given meat broth and a thin basil drink. He should use rose water perfume and have his chest gargled with it, and all other things we have mentioned in the section on fainting caused by bloodletting.
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for excessive bloodletting and whose strength is weak, to release blood little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, and whose body is strong, let him do so seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.
As for whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has flowed, he should be treated on the second or third day.
As for whoever has a lot of blood in his body that has become hot and acute and has caused fever, it is necessary to remove the blood from him all at once and take out a large amount of it and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having examined all the conditions of phlebotomy, and to place your hand on his pulse when the blood is flowing so that death does not occur instead of fainting. This happens often if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
It is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and release the blood again, and the mouth of the vein has closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it hard or twist with force because that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you perform phlebotomy again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has clotted from the blood at the mouth of the vein, or apply to it some salt that has been dissolved in water, or apply some theriac or scammony, and press gently until the blood comes out.
If the vein is swollen, leave it alone and do not touch it until the swelling subsides.
If there is a need to release blood again, it is unavoidable; then either bleed him above that area, or bleed him in the other arm or in the other vein.
As for phlebotomy of the median cubital vein, it is phlebotomized as a substitute for the median and the basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of the two.
The method of its phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm becomes red and the vein appears clearly, then you tie it above it with the bandage slightly, moderately tight, then you phlebotomize the vein obliquely, a little, not horizontally or vertically, and let the opening be wide and let your phlebotomy be a little above the wrist joint.
If blood flow is difficult, put the hand back into the container with hot water and let the blood flow into the water until your need is met. If you are in the summer days, you might not need to put the hand back into the water. Mostly, flowing of the blood into hot water is practiced during winter.
Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments, and the method of its phlebotomy is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells and becomes very clear to the touch, then you phlebotomize it slightly obliquely, and even if you cut it completely, it will not harm it at all. Be careful not to go deep with your lancet because the nerve of the fingers is beneath it and the area is devoid of flesh.
Then put the hand back into the hot water and let the blood flow in it. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and stop flowing. Once you have removed the required amount of blood, put some fat and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly. The same applies to every narrow branch.
As for the benefit of phlebotomizing it from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments, and similarly you do in its phlebotomy as you did with the second one, the same way.
As for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body such as uterine ailments, menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
The method of its phlebotomy is to put his leg in hot water and massage it until the veins flow, then tie it above the ankle joint. The vein is located at the heel, visible towards the big toe, and it branches out into many branches on the leg. So, phlebotomize it at its widest branch, or at the heel at its confluence. This is best and safest.
If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the leg, be careful of the nerves underneath on the surface of the leg, and make your phlebotomy oblique, as if you intend to cut it, and the lancet should be sharp.
If the blood flow is difficult, let him put his leg back in the hot water and leave the blood to flow until it drains.
If the phlebotomist misses the vein with the phlebotomy in the first round, let him repeat the phlebotomy slightly above it, for the area is safe and there is no fear of a problem if you are careful of the nerve as we said. And similarly you do with the saphenous vein of the other leg in the same way.
As for the sciatic vein, its place as we said is at the heel of the lateral side, and the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood. The method of its phlebotomy is to have the patient enter the bath quickly and tie his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage, because it does not appear otherwise.
When it appears, phlebotomize it in any case you can, either obliquely, which is better, or sever it completely or make an incision, because its place is safe.
It is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all, phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers. Beware of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want, then loosen the bandage and put cotton on the place of phlebotomy and bandage the area, for it heals quickly.
Chapter ninety-six on cupping and how to use it.
Its mouth opening should be two open fingers, as we have illustrated, and its depth should be half a span. ويكون فى جنبها فى نحو النصف منها ثقبة صغيرة على قدر ما تدخله الإبرة تصنع من النحاس الصينىّ او النحاس الأصفر غليظة الحاشية ملساء مستوية مجلوّة لئلّا تؤذى العضو عند وضعها عليه.
And in its center, there should be a transverse rod of copper or iron where the candle is placed with fire. This cupping glass can be made larger than what we described, and smaller, depending on the illnesses and age of the user, for the cupping glasses of children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses of men and bulky bodies.
As for how to place this cupping glass with fire on the organ, it is that you light a wick with fire from tightly woven linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the center of the hardened rod that is in the center of the cupping glass so that the ascent of the fire upwards is towards the bottom of the cupping glass so that the body of the sick person does not burn. Then it is placed on the organ with a finger on the hole that we mentioned so that if we hold the cupping glass, what we need, the finger is removed and the vapor comes out of that hole and the cupping glass is released on the spot.
Then light the wick in the manner described and repeat it if needed.
As for the cupping glass that is used for the illness of shuwsa (a swelling/inflammation) with water, it does not have a hardened rod nor a hole, but rather it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only.
And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is,
Chapter ninety-seven on the application of leeches.
Leeches are mostly used on organs where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because they are too small, like the lip and gums, etc., or because the organ is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose, etc.
The method of using them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water, free from putrefaction, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they become hungry and nothing remains in their bellies, then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the affected organ is rubbed until it becomes red, then the leeches are placed on it, and when they are full, they fall off.
And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leeches fall off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the oozing stops.
If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle powdered alum or gallnut or similar astringents on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of green beans on the area and leave them until the beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop.
And it is advisable, if there is a need to reapply leeches, not to use the same leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood, or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for if they sense some blood, they will stick to the spot. If you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
The third chapter on bone-setting. هذا الباب أيضا من وكيد ما يحتاج عليه فى صناعة الطبّ وهو جبر الكسر والفكّ الحادثين فى العظام.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a letter of it.
And for this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country. وإنّى لم ألق فيه قطّ محسنا البتّة
Then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompassed and my experience has gone through, after I brought it closer to you and purified it from the branches of prolixity, and I summarized it to the utmost brevity and clarified it to the utmost clarity.
And I have depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it, as it is an increase in clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
And there is no power except in Allah, the Most High, the Great.
The first chapter, in it are sentences and summaries on the matter of bone fractures, which must be presented.
And before we begin to mention the broken and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary to mention at the beginning of this chapter some words and sections that first compel you and those other than you who are eager to learn this noble craft to understand them and comprehend their reality, so I say that whenever someone experiences a fracture, dislocation, contusion, or fall, it is necessary to first hasten to phlebotomize him, give him a laxative, or both, unless there is something that prevents this, such as weakness of strength, or if the one who experienced this is a boy, a senile old man, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold. Then his diet should be restricted to cold vegetables, poultry meat, and kid meat, and he should be prevented from drinking alcohol, thick meats, filling up on food, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling subsides and there is no longer expectation of matter flowing to the site. At that time, let the patient return to his first regimen, which is his usual habit.
When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that are very nourishing, thick, and firm, and contain stickiness, such as harees, rice, heads, trotters, cow tripe, eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and so on, for with this regimen the healing of the fracture will be faster and better.
And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, can never connect and heal to their original nature, due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, and bones that are extremely soft, like the bones of young children, may connect and heal. However, nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something like thick glue that adheres to it and strengthens it until it sticks together and binds together until it becomes extremely strong and firm as it was before, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason, it is necessary to make the patient's diet consist of foods that contain firmness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures may vary according to the difference in limbs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the sternum is different from a fracture of the back, and so on for all the other limbs, each different from the other.
And we will mention each type of fracture explained in its chapter, detailed separately from others.
And the type of bone fracture may also vary in itself, because it may be a fragmented fracture without splinters, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with splinters and protrusions, either loose or not loose, and the fracture may be accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, or the fracture may be a minor crack.
And each type has a specific technique for its treatment, as will be mentioned in detail in its place.
And among the things by which a bone fracture is recognized are its curvature, its protuberance, its appearance to the senses, and its crepitation when you press it with your hand. So when there is no apparent curvature in the site, no crepitation, no feeling of disturbance when you palpate the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture there, but it may be a contusion, a minor fracture, or a minor crack. So it is not necessary to move it by extension and pressing at all, but apply to it the medicines that will be mentioned later that suit the site, then tighten it gently.
And know that if the bone is broken into two without splinters, but each part has moved away from its counterpart, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before hot swelling occurs.
If hot swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that its treatment and alignment are easier than a bone that has splinters.
Then tighten it as will be mentioned.
If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg, either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your placement of the limb be on a level surface, in its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken bone are extended, then quickly return those protrusions to their places in every way you can with skill and gentleness, and strive your best not to cause the patient any pain or suffering with your actions, and strive your best to join one bone to its counterpart in the best way.
And it is necessary at that time to touch and palpate them with your hand. If you see something wrong there, correct and align it as much as you can.
And beware of excessive extension and strong pressing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb with their actions, as I have witnessed their actions many times.
Then, after alignment, perfection, and tightening, keep that limb still and at rest, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking and sleeping hours, and when he turns and moves, and when he defecates, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him ensure that the position of the limb is a position in which he is safe from pain.
This is because whenever he feels pain or suffering when positioning the limb, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, and he should ensure that this position is level and straight so that no curvature occurs in the limb when it heals.
As for how to tighten the broken limb, it is as I am describing to you.
Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness, largeness, and structure. So what is small among them, such as the arm, finger, ulna, and so on, the cloth bandages should be soft and thin, and what is thick among them, such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be wide and firm, because the wide bandage adheres to the large limb and tightens it from every side evenly, without any gaps.
Then, after you have finished aligning, apply the appropriate ointment on a soft cloth to the fracture site, then start wrapping the bandage around the fracture site itself three or four times, depending on what the limb requires, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then go with it to the upper side of the fracture site with less tightening than your tightening of the fractured site, then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and loosen the tightening gradually until you take something suitable from the healthy area. Then take another bandage and also wrap it around the fractured site a few times, then go with the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping. Then place between the bandages of the soft cloth or rags whatever levels the curvature of the fracture if there is curvature, otherwise, do not put anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage around it, then immediately apply the firm splints over these wraps if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation in it, apply to it what soothes that swelling and removes the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then tighten the splints on it at that time. And let the splints be made of wide, carved, and wisely prepared reed halves, or let the splints be made of sieve wood, which is made from pine, palm leaf stalks, heather, or alkali, and so on, of what is available.
And let the width of each splint be exactly like this image and this shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints.
As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the broken limb, in terms of its size.
Image of the splint:
Then you tighten over the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then you tie from above with tight threads according to what we mentioned about the tightening, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture be more, and the further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, like what I have seen from the actions of the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, which is a grave mistake, because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and the thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the tightening you desire with them.
And there should not be less than a finger's width between the splint and the splint, and if the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then put under them soft lint or fluffed wool so that it does not harm him in any way.
And if the fracture is with a wound and a tear in the skin has occurred, we will mention it separately.
And know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, because if the limb is large, the splints should not be placed on it except after five days or seven or more, depending on your safety from the occurrence of a hot swelling.
And this is the description of the bandages with which the ancients used to set fractures, which are placed on the fracture, the jaw, and the sprain.
Description of a brief, common bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither predominantly hot nor cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the millstone, which is the heart of the flour that clings to the walls of the millstone during the movement of the mill, then you knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, and you make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you use it.
Description of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains. يؤخذ من الماش واللادن والأقاقيا والراسن والمغاث والسكّ من كلّ واحد عشرة دراهم ومرّ وصبر من كلّ واحد خمسة دراهم ومن الأثل عشرون درهما ومن الطين الأرمنىّ او الرومىّ عشرون درهما يدقّ الجميع ويخلط بماء الأثل او ببياض البيض إن كان مزاج العليل محرورا ثمّ يستعمل هذا الضماد فإنّه حسن التأليف يجبر العظام المكسورة سريعا ويصلح لأكثر الناس لاعتداله،
Description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains. يؤخذ مغاث وماش وخطمىّ أبيض من كلّ واحد عشرة دراهم مرّ وصبر من كلّ واحد خمسة دراهم أقاقيا ستّة دراهم طين أرمنىّ عشرون درهما يدقّ الجميع دقّا ناعما وينخل ويعجن بالماء او ببياض البيض ويستعمل،
Description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their places, and it soothes the pain that occurs to them, and for bone fissures and fractures. يؤخذ الصوف الموذّح فيغمس فى الخلّ والزيت المطبوخ ويوضع على الموضع،
This bandage does not have the strength to set bones, but it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pains in particular.
Description of another bandage that sets broken bones. يؤخذ ورق التين الأصمّ وورق الخشخاش البرّىّ ويدقّا جميعا ويضمد بهما رطبين،
Description of another brief bandage used when the bone fracture is setting and you want to resolve the remaining swelling. تأخذ من أصل الخطمىّ والبابونج ونوار بنفسج ودقيق الكرسنّة من كلّ واحد جزءا دقّ الجميع واعجنه بالطلاء إن لم يكن العضو مستحرّا فإن كان مستحرّا فاعجنه بماء الكزبرة او بالماء واستعمله،
Description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is setting. يؤخذ من أصل الخطمىّ وبزر الكتّان والحلبة وإكليل الملك ومرزنجوش ونوار بنفسج وبابونج من كلّ واحد جزء يدقّ الجميع ويعجن بماء الخلاف او بالماء العذب او بالطلاء كلّ ذلك على حسب حرارة العضو وسكون حرّه،
As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything be placed on the fractured limb when setting it except the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else, and he described it as being medium between thick and thin.
As for Galen, he saw that things that have dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar to what we mentioned, should be placed on the fractured limb when setting it.
Description of a bandage that is useful for weakness and pain. يؤخذ مغاث وحمّص وشعر إنسان مقروض او ريش طائر وخطمىّ وملح أجزاء سواء يدقّ وينخل ويعجن ويضمد به،
As for the amount of time the bandage should remain then be loosened, it is that you observe, and if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place, then do not loosen it for many days.  If severe itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then hasten to loosen it immediately and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it.
Then take a soft cloth or a moist sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then apply to it clarified wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and tie it on for a night until you are safe from hot swelling, the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain goes away.  Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as your first tightening, and be gentle with it until it heals.
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, swelling, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need the bandage and tightening, then reapply it as you did initially, exactly.
If none of what we mentioned occurs in the limb, do not loosen it except after three days or four or five or seven, and it may be left for twenty days, all of that depending on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture sets and the flesh nearly coagulates on it, then increase the tightening more than your first tightening altogether, and also increase the thickening of the patient's food as mentioned previously.
If you see that the site of the fracture has dried and become emaciated more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it, so moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and slightly reduce the tightening, for by this action nourishment will flow to the limb and it will heal quickly.
As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the limb again if it did not set properly the first time and set crookedly, it is a mistake of their doing and a great deception. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of that from any of them at all, and the correct thing is not to do it.
The second chapter on the fracture occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are various, and their causes are diverse.
Some fractures result from a sword blow, and it may either completely shave the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath it, like an adze does to wood, and therefore this type of fracture is called adze-like (qadumi).
Or, the sword may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface without penetrating through it completely, and this type of fracture is called a simple extraction (qala).
The wound of these two types of fractures may be either large or small.
Some fractures are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone or something similar.
This fracture is either penetrating, having almost reached the membrane under the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone. ويكون جرح هذين الكسرين أيضا إمّا كبيرا وإمّا صغيرا
Some fractures are hidden in the bone with the thinness of a hair, which is a slight fissure, and therefore this type of fracture is called hairline (sha'ri).
Among them is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or something similar, which causes the surface of the bone to depress inward, creating a concavity, similar to what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a part of it to depress inwards.
This most often occurs in heads with soft bones, like the heads of children.
All of these types of fractures may have loose or non-loose fragments. وسنأتى بذكر علاج ذلك كلّه فى موضعه
We identify all of these types of fractures by examining them, probing them with probes, and removing the dead flesh from them.
As for the hairline type, it is identified by exposing the bone, wiping it, and smearing it with ink; the fracture will appear black.
As for the treatment of fractures, first look at the patient's symptoms. If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and other similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.
That is, if the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.
If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes infected, leading to the symptoms we described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and it is accompanied by comminution and crushing, then you should cut the comminuted and crushed part as I will describe to you.
That is, shave the injured patient's head and expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient.
If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as necessary. وهو أن تحشو الموضع بخرق مغموسة فى شراب ودهن ورد ونقّ الجرح حتّى يسكن الورم وتأمن النزف
Then proceed to excise and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
The first way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed instrument, and this is its image:
Then you use another piece after this piece, slightly wider, and this is its picture:
Then you also use another chisel, wider than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a set of different chisels, some of which are wider than others and some of which are shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp at their edges. ولتكن من حديد هندىّ او فولاد جيّد.
And use gentleness in striking the chisel, lest you shake the head and harm it.
If the bone is strong and hard, then it is appropriate that you drill around it before using the chisels with the drills they called non-sinking drills.
And they called them non-sinking drills because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, that prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate for you to take from these drills a large number, each one of which is suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip is of a length and shortness appropriate to the thickness of that skull.
And this is a picture of three types of drills: large, medium, and small:
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. ثمّ تنقل المثقب الى موضع آخر وتجعل بعد ما بين كلّ ثقب قدر غلظ المرود او نحوه،
Then you cut with the cutters between each two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments that were prepared for that, such as forceps and delicate hooks.
And you should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the periosteum.
So if you hollow out the bone and it is cleared of the periosteum, if it was attached to it, and you take it out, then you should scrape and smooth the roughness of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and smoother than the rest of the cutters.
If anything remains of the small bones and fragments, then take them gently with the instruments you have, then treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned.
As for the other aspect of the procedure, it is an easy aspect, far from danger, mentioned by Galen and praised highly, and this is his saying: ينبغى لك أوّلا أن تبدأ بكشف جزء العظم من الموضع الذى الكسر فيه أشدّ وأشهر حتّى اذا كشفت ذلك الجزء صيّرت تحته طرف هذا المقطع العدسىّ وهذه صورته:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the peritoneum and the face of the sharp section is on the bone.
Then you strike the section from one side with a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no frightening accident will happen at all, even if the therapist is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.
If something attached to the bone from the membrane remains in some places of the bone, then scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular section itself and gently remove it from it, for it will be removed without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was cut from the bone was its surface, and roughness and fine fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to strip that roughness and remove those fragments with fine scrapers, of which several different sizes have been made, so that you can use them in every place that is most suitable and most appropriate, depending on what the work and the broken bone itself and its shape lead you to.
And you should use in your stripping first for the bone the widest of those scrapers, then use after it a finer one, and you continue to do that successively until you get to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the rest of the small capillary cracks and the fine fracture, it is necessary to use a treatment for each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has come across what we have written and explained in major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth and dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do that as lightly as you can so that you do not weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except as much as it holds the wound only.
And you leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then you dissolve it and use after that the medicines that have excess dryness, such as orris roots, cress flour, frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is to make a powder from these medicines and sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use a medicine in it that clarifies and does not sting.
And strive your best while treating the wound that it be clean, that there be no harm to the fat or dirt in it, and do not let pus gather in it at all, because pus, if it gathers on the brain membrane, corrupts it and rots it, so a great affliction happens to the patient from that.
Blackness may appear on the surface of the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected, you have observed. If the symptoms we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed.
And if the blackness only occurred from a medicine placed on it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary to take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.
The third chapter on the reduction of the nose if it is broken.
Know that nothing breaks from the nose except its upper two sides together or one of them, because they are bones, because the lower part of it is cartilage and does not break.
But rather, it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.
If one of its sides breaks, then you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape. وليكن ذلك منك برفق وتتحرّى أن لا يحدث بفعلك ذلك على العليل وجع،
If the fracture is in the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe.
If the fracture is on both sides, then do the same.
And hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture if possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides.
Then insert into the nostril a wick of linen scraps if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides. ولتكُن الفتل فيها غلظ على قدر ما يملا ثقب الأنف،
Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day. ولست أرى أنا ذلك
You may insert goose feather tubes in the nose in place of the wicks after wrapping soft rags around them. فيكون حبسها لكسر الأنف أشدّ ولئلا يمتنع العليل من التنفّس
This is not necessary, if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.
If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, then dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some of the diachylon ointment.
If a hot swelling does not occur, then you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. ثمّ تضع عليه مشاقة ليّنة ولا تربط الأنف بشىء البتّة،
If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or shattered, then you should incise over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument. ثمّ تخيط الشقّ وتعالجه بما يلحم ويدمل من المراهم الموافقة لذلك،
If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes until it heals.
Chapter four on the reduction of the lower jaw if it is broken
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, examine it. If the fracture is external only and not a double fracture and it is concave inward, then its diagnosis is easy. Thus, if the fracture is in the right fissure, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is in the left fissure, you should insert the index finger of the right hand.  Gently lift the hump of the fracture outward from the inside, and with your other hand from outside the bone, control and align it.
If the fracture of the jaw is in two pieces, then extension should be applied from both sides in a straight line until you can align it.
If the teeth have become loose or separated, tie those that you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then, place cerate on the broken jaw, and place a folded cloth over it. On the cloth, place a large, tight splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then bandage it from above as it seems appropriate to you to bandage it and tie it so that it will not become loose. Order the patient to be quiet and still, and make his food soft broths.
If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then quickly undo it on the third day. Then repair what you bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour, after removing the cerate from it. Place a soft bandage on the dressing.
As long as that dressing adheres to it and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it and do not undo it until it heals and the fracture becomes firm. This fracture often becomes firm in three weeks.
If a hot swelling occurs during that time, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the swelling subsides.
However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If a fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those fragments with whatever instrument you find appropriate.
If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have extracted those fragments and nothing of them remains, stitch the mouth of the wound if it is wide. Otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for it and join the wound until it heals.
The fifth chapter on the reduction of the clavicle if it is fractured
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder.
Its fracture takes one of three forms: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest to reduce; or fragments occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to reduce; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
The procedure in it, if the fracture is without a wound, is to bring two assistants, one of whom stabilizes the arm next to the fractured clavicle and the other extends the neck toward the other side.
Then you straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape becomes as it should be, and there is no protrusion or curvature in it.
If you need more extension, it is appropriate to place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit, its size being according to your need, and you extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.
If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, it is appropriate for the patient to lie on his back and a medium-sized pillow be placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downward until the clavicle bone that is deep rises up, then at that time, fix the fracture and straighten it with your fingers
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and has started to move, it is appropriate to make an incision over it and remove that fragment gently.
If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be clever in cutting it with one of the cutters that you have prepared for this purpose, after the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument made of wood or iron, has been placed under the clavicle, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, its width depending on the size of the bone you need, and its length depending also on what allows you to work, and let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the tear in the wound that you made when removing the bone fragment is wide, and you are safe from a hot swelling, bring together the lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the tear is small, or you fear a hot swelling, pack the wound with bandages and pads according to the extent of the wound's opening.
If a hot swelling appears, soak the bandage in rose oil and vinegar or wine, and apply it on it.
As for bone setting, if it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply on the bone the poultice made from mill dust with egg white, and place the soft compress on it, then place the ball under his armpit if needed. ثمّ تأخذ عمامة تكون طويلة جدّا ويكون عرضها شبرا او نحو ذلك
And the key to it all is that the splint does not move from the broken bone, and therefore it is necessary that you check the patient every day, so whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix that and tighten the bandage.
Then make the patient sleep on his back and put a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night so that his arm is raised from his side, so the clavicle fracture is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is an incident in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the poultice if you see reason for that, and repeat the tightening, and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and sets.
And it becomes stronger and firmer than that in twenty-eight days, and it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six on the reduction of shoulder fractures.
The shoulder blade rarely breaks in its wide part. وإنّما تنكسر منها حروفها
Whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, which is known by touch, depending on the shape of the fracture, you must straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means possible.
Then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaqa (a type of plaster). وضع من فوق رفادة من خرقة مثنيّة
If there is a curvature under the splint in any place of the shoulder, correct that curvature with soft mashaqa until the splint sits evenly.
Then tighten it from above with a long turban, tightly and firmly, and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place.
Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.
The patient should lie on his healthy side.
The shoulder heals in twenty or twenty-five days.
When this period is complete, untie the bandage and you will be safe, for it is among the bones that are not feared to shatter or deteriorate.
If a splinter of bone protrudes and it pricks under the skin, incise it and extract it, and do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle about soothing the hot swelling if any of that occurs.
Chapter seven on the treatment of rib fractures.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. وأمّا أطرافه فهى أكثر ما تنكسر وتنفتّت
And among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and he experiences severe pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and the concavity in the broken bone becomes apparent and is not hidden to the senses.
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are gathered with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is exercised in straightening it in every way possible and suitable until the shape of the bone returns as it should be.
Then apply the dressing and the binding, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth. ثمّ تلطّف فى ربطها على العظم المكسور لئلّا تزول
And if the need arises to loosen it, due to itching that occurs in the area, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to loosen it, remove the dressing, and treat whatever has occurred in its proper manner, then replace the dressing if you see a reason for it, and keep it tight until it heals.
The eighth chapter on the mending of ribs if they are broken.
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts adjacent to the back. وأطرافها من قدّام إنّما يعرض لها الرضّ من أجل أنّها غضروفيّة
Its reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the most effective way until the shape is as it should be. ثمّ تضمّد وتشدّ العظم المكسور بجبيرة إن احتاج الى ذلك
If the rib fracture is tilted inwards, it causes the patient severe pain and a stabbing sensation like the stabbing that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone stabs the diaphragm. ويعرض له أيضا عسر النفس والسعال وقذف دم كثير وهذا عسر العلاج
The ancients devised many tricks for it.
Some of them said it is necessary to make the patient's food something that generates flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands and pushes the fracture outwards.
We dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred. فإن كان قد حدث فإنّه يزيد فيه ويؤكّده
Some of them said a cupping glass is placed on the area and then sucked strongly, and this is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the area because of its weakness.
Some of them said the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil, and padding should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is level when you wrap it around circularly.
Then treat the patient with the treatment of pleurisy in terms of food and medicine.
If the patient is exhausted by a severe matter that he cannot bear and the bone stabs the diaphragm with a harmful stab, and we fear for the patient, then we should incise the area and expose the broken rib. ثمّ نصير تحته الآلة التى تحفظ الصفاق التى تقدّم وصفها ونقطع العظم برفق ونخرجه
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals.
If a hot swelling occurs during that, immediately wet padding in rose oil and place it on the area. وعالج العليل بما يسكن الورم من داخل أيضا ويستلقى على الجانب الذى يخفّ عليه النوم حتّى يبرأ
The ninth chapter on the mending of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs in them – and this rarely happens to them, what happens most often is a bruise, and likewise the vertebrae of the back as well – if that happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not, look: if you see that his hands have become limp, numb, and dead, and he is unable to move them, or stretch them, or grasp with them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not find any pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases, he is doomed.
And if he moves them and feels the pinch and the pricking in them, then know that the bone marrow is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
If something similar happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether he will also recover or not, look at his legs.  If you see that they have become limp and what happened to the hands has also happened to them, then if he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not bother with his treatment.
If none of this happens to him, the matter is less severe.
And the treatment for what happened is that you try to soothe the hot swelling by placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg whites, on the bruised vertebra.  Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying bandages and tighten it with a bandage. Order him to rest and stay still, and not to sleep except on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers.
If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone during the bruise, from which pus has come out, then it is necessary to cut the skin over it and extract that bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together, if it is large, with stitching, then treat it with healing ointments until it recovers.
If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus and straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and as straightening allows. Then apply a bandage and a splint if needed, and then tighten it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, cut over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the treatment mentioned previously until it heals.
The tenth chapter on the reduction of hip fracture.
Rarely do the hip bones break. فإن انكسرت فإنّما يكون كسرها أن تتفتّت فى أطرافها وتنشقّ فى الطول وتميل الى داخل
Its treatment is to run your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture.
If the break is only at the ends, then adjust the fracture according to what you can achieve in setting it until its shape resembles its natural shape.
If the break is lengthwise, or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can set the fracture. فإذا سوّيته حملت عليه الضماد ثمّ تضع عليه جبيرة من خشب او من جلد وشدّه شدّا لا تخاف عليه انتقال الكسر ولا زوال الجبيرة
And level the hollow of the flanks with whatever fills it so that the tightening takes hold evenly. وتأمر العليل أن ينام على ظهره او على جنبه الصحيح
If a hot swelling appears, stop extending and setting it until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what soothes it, as described previously, then return to setting it and tightening it as appropriate.
If fragments appear in the bone, or if anything shatters from its ends, it should not be removed or touched, but rather leveled from the outside, as we have said, and left untightened until it heals.
Chapter eleven on the reduction of a fracture of the humerus
The upper arm is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
If it breaks, then set it in one of two ways.
One of them is that you take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness in this way:
And you tie two bandages at its ends, then hang it from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is attached to the middle of the curve of the wood, then a heavy object is hung from above it or an assistant stretches it downwards, then the physician adjusts the fracture with both his hands until the fracture returns to what it should be.
The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage, then you order two assistants, one of them to hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold what is below it and each of them stretches it to his side.
And if you want the stretching to be stronger, tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the assistants stretches them to their side.
If the fracture is close to the end of the shoulder, then the [middle] of the bandage should be under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then the bandage should be placed on that place and on the elbow itself.
Then adjust the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is aligned as it should be and heals well, then tighten it if no hot swelling appears, but if a hot swelling appears, leave it tightened until the seventh day, and put on it clarified wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides, then tighten it.
The method of tightening it is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a roll of new cloth over the dressing, then gather the forearm onto the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And apply the cloth and the tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing has changed on the broken bone.
If you fear that something might change on you from that, then use splints, which is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let the width of a finger be between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers from each side, then tighten on the splints the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture should be stronger, and the further away the fracture is, the less the tightening should be.
If you see fit to place the splints and the tightening as we said while you are setting the limb from your hour, then do so.
And if you fear the hot swelling, then leave the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said, then check the bandage every three days so that no itching or swelling occurs in the place, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, so fix all of that as we mentioned.
If you are confident that nothing of that will happen, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days.
And the patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderate elbow pad filled with wool is placed under the upper arm.
And check at all times, night or day, so that the shape of the broken limb does not become distorted or the bandage loosens, so fix all of that with your effort.
And make the patient's food of the order that we presented, that the food be light at first until the bone starts to strengthen, then you should thicken his food.
It is customary for the upper arm and leg to strengthen in forty days, so then it should be loosened and the bath should be used and treated with ointments that are suitable for that.
If the fracture is severe and crushed, do not loosen the bandage from it until fifty days or two months.
The twelfth chapter on the reduction of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones called the two ulnas, one of which is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is located below the small one from the bottom; so perhaps the larger ulna may be broken alone or the small one alone, and perhaps both may be broken together.
So when the small upper ulna is broken, its repair is easy and its healing is faster, and when the lower ulna is broken, its breakage is bad and its healing is difficult, and the worst of it is if the two bones break together.
So, if the bone that is broken is the small upper ulna, then the physician should, when repairing it, make its extension slight gently until he straightens it; and if the large ulna is the one that is broken, then he should make its extension stronger; and if both ulnas are the ones that are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand when repairing it and extending it stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be upwards, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged, and let the cushion be opposite him in height so that the patient is not burdened with hardship; then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise; then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can.
And if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then you try to return each splinter to its place with your best effort. If a loose splinter appears in it and it is piercing the skin, and you have no hope of repairing it, then incise upon it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then I have devoted a chapter to it, so you take the treatment for that from there.
And if a hot swelling occurs at the beginning of your repair, then smear a cloth with the cerate made with rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth on it with a gentle tie until the swelling subsides, then remove the cerate and apply the poultice prepared from mill dust with egg white, then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
And know that the number of arm splints is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one ulna or in both ulnas together.
Then make your tightening on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter, and whenever you turn the tightening upwards or downwards, make the tightening slightly looser, as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped on the fracture be soft and moist cloths, and let them not be very hard, and let the thread that is tied with it be specifically linen, medium between thin and thick, as we described.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days, and if something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itch occurring in the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the itch subsides, and leave the limb untied for a night until it rests, then resume tightening.
And if the tightening has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all of that with your best effort.
And look also, and if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then you should loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until the nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
And if nothing of what we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be loosened until after twenty days or so.
Then hang the patient's hand from his neck, and let his arm be straight, and let him diligently avoid turbulent movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days, all of that according to the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.
Chapter thirteen on the treatment of fractures of the palm and fingers.
The metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fractures, but they are frequently subject to contusions.
When a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand, the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him, then place his outstretched hand on it. Then, an assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are well-joined. At that point, a bandage and a splint should be applied if there is no hot swelling.
Then a splint, the size of the affected area, should be applied on top, having been inserted into a soft cloth.
If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make something like a ball from a piece of cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand.  Then, tie it with a long cloth, and let the splint be made of supple leather so that the leather conforms to the flexion of the entire hand, and tighten it as needed.
If the fracture is outwards, you should apply a splint from above and another splint from below in the hand so that the hand remains open and straight. Then apply the bandaging as the hand turns and connect between the fingers with the bandage.
If the fracture affects one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be aligned as necessary, then bandaged with the hand. If you prefer, you can apply a small straight splint to stabilize the fracture and prevent movement. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align it and tie it with the adjacent healthy finger, or tie them all together in sequence, which is better, or apply a small straight splint as we mentioned for the thumb. Check during your treatment and after it for hot swelling and treat it accordingly whenever anything of this happens, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen on the Reduction of a Femur Fracture
The femur bone often breaks and is perceptible to the senses because it turns forward and backward.
Its mending is done by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, while the patient is lying on his face.
Then an assistant stretches each bandage to its side moderately, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the origin of the femur, it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either from wool or similar, at the origin of the femur towards the pubis, so that the stretching is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the stretching is downwards.
Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form, and the bone unites well.
Then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening if no hot swelling occurs to the limb. فإن حدث فيه الورم فاتركه أيّاما حتّى يسكن الورم الحارّ ثمّ ارجع الى علاجه
As for its tightening, it is necessary to twist a solid, wide turban over the fracture two or three times, and whatever is left over remains.
Then twist the leg until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread become from above on both sides. ثمّ تدير على الساق والفخذ ما فضل من العمامة
Then place the splints on the thigh at the fracture site itself, and place one of them on the leg bone.
Then fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths to level the tightening.
Then start with strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site, three or four turns, and the further you move the bandage from the fracture site, let your tightening be less, softer, and looser.
Then go to the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie with it the adjacent splints from above, then pass the ends of the thread down until you reach the man's ankle, and tighten with them also the ends of the splints from the other side so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then leave the tightening on it as long as no erosion, swelling, inflammation, or the like occurs to the limb. فإن حدث شىء من ذلك فبادر بحلّه وأصلح ما حدث من ذلك كلّه على ما ذكرنا مرارا
If there is a splinter in the bone that pricks, it is necessary to straighten it if you can, otherwise cut on it and remove it, and treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
This fracture of the femur may be tightened without adding the leg to the splints, as we mentioned in the humerus and forearm.
Except that its mending in this way does not cause lameness to the patient, and if it is mended alone without adding the leg to it, its owner will inevitably limp forever.
And know that the femur heals in fifty days, or a little more or a little less, all according to the difference in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen: On the Fracture of the Patella
The patella rarely fractures, but it is often subject to bruising.
If it does fracture, it will either be a fissure or a comminuted fracture into pieces. ويكون ذلك مع جرح وغير جرح
Its treatment is to align the separated parts with your fingers until they are joined and fitted together, to the best of your ability, gently and skillfully.
Then apply a bandage, and over it a rounded splint, if needed, and tie it firmly as appropriate.
Then treat all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom with what is appropriate for it until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen on the Reduction of a Fracture of the Leg
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula. They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm, and therefore their treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is one.
If both bones are broken, the leg will turn in all directions.
If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will turn forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken and it happens from below, it is something that is not hidden from you. فاستعمل المدّ والتسوية وربط الجبائر على حسب ذلك سواء إلّا أنّه ينبغى إن كان كسر الساق كسرا فاحشا ذا شظايا كثيرة أن يكون المدّ أقلّ وأخفّ وترفق جهدك بجبره،
In the leg, there is something extra in the procedure compared to the arm, which is that when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, which are used in leveling rooms, that are placed between the cracks of the planks, or they can be from palm leaf ribs, or similar, and choose from them those that have a little thickness and are not thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee to the bottom.
Then wrap a cloth around each one twice along its length, and place one on the leg and the other on the other side, and let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot.
Then tie the two thin strips in three places, at the ends and the middle, for by this restraint the leg is prevented from tilting right and left and is well stabilized.
A wooden gutter may be used along the length of the leg and placed in it to protect it from movement, and it is most important to do this in a fracture, especially if it is accompanied by a wound.
Then check the leg every day and take great care of it for swelling or inflation or any of that, so whenever anything of that happens, treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
And the leg bone heals in thirty days or so.
Chapter seventeen on the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.
As for the heel, it does not suffer a fracture at all.
As for the bones of the leg, they may suffer a fracture, and the toes also rarely suffer a fracture, but rather they suffer a bruise in most cases.
If the bones of the leg suffer a fracture and you see that those bones have overlapped, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright like a walker, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then step on it and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Then carry the bandage and the splint from above and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends.
Then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with rags and all that you need.
When three or four days have passed for him, release the bandage, for you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.
But if some of the toes are broken, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand. ثمّ اجعل للأصبع المكسورة جبيرة على طول الأصبع ولتكن أعرض منها قليلا
Then place under the foot this board that I described to you and tighten it tightly.
If the broken bones are two or three or more, then put on each toe a splint of its size inserted in a soft cloth and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to observe all that we have mentioned to you in the rest of the fracture, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and treat each symptom with what is appropriate.
Chapter Eighteen on the fracture of the woman's clitoris and the pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, sit her cross-legged, then bend her slightly towards her back, and let someone hold her from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva. Then shake the woman and lift her back slightly, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the entrance of the vulva like a ball and the bone fracture returns to place.
Then place a support on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently until she urinates and return it in the same way you inserted it first. Then she returns to her initial support.
Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal.
If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva, then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place.
Then pack it with cotton and stay for days as we described until it heals.
As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use what we described for the hip bone to repair and straighten it.
The correct approach in these strange fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience who understands this book of mine well, should not be hidden from you, because the fracture itself in most cases guides you to the correct way to repair and tighten it, so understand.
As for a man's penis, if it is fractured, take the gullet of a goose and insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth on it and bind it and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter nineteen on the reduction of bone fractures if they are with a wound.
It is advisable for one who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, to immediately phlebotomize him at the time, if the conditions for phlebotomy are met, as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, then you should hasten to stop it by sprinkling powdered vitriol on it, if you have nothing else available.
Then proceed to set the fracture on that very same day and do not delay it unless a hot swelling occurs.
If a hot swelling occurs, leave the setting of the fracture until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for bad symptoms may arise.
If the broken bone is protruding from the skin and exposed, you should attempt to reduce and align it with your hands gently and with a slight extension.
If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, its length being about seven or eight fingers and its width according to the size of the wound. ولذلك ينبغى للطبيب أن يتّخذ منها ثلاثا او أربعا على قدر ما يحتاج اليه من العلاج فى كلّ نوع من الكسر
And let it be rounded with a slight thickness so that it does not bend when pressed upon during the operation, and let it have a sharp end with a hook at its tip, its upper part being thick and from its middle to the bottom very thin.
And this is its image:
And it is called in Greek "peron" meaning a small lever.
It is necessary that its sharp, curved end be placed on the protruding end of the bone, and push it with it at once, so that when the bone returns and is somewhat leveled, then level the ends of the fracture on each other.
If its broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, it is necessary to cut the end of that bone so that the instrument can grip it.
If you are absolutely unable to reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with something similar to the cutters that we mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws however you can.
Then scrape off what remains on the bone of roughness and thin scales.
If you reduce the bone and the patient finds, after its reduction, severe and harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.
When you have completed your setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if you are in the summer, and do not put on the wound a cerate nor anything containing fat, lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it.
Then use splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound, and beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for ignorant doctors often do that, causing their patients either death or gangrene or inflammation; and let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of the rest of the fracture.
If the wound is bad, or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms that we have described, and he finds disturbing pain in the place, it is not necessary to put splints on it; make for it bandages of hard cloths in the place of the splints and tighten it with them.
If it is after a day or two and you see that pus has begun to generate in the wound, remove the cloth that you put on it with the drink, then use the threads and ointments that we are accustomed to treat wounds with, such as the quadruple ointment and the like.
It is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and inspect the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and recovers.
It is necessary to position the limb in a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
If many days pass for the wound and it does not heal and the pus does not stop from it, know that there are small bone fragments there, so it is necessary to search the wound with a probe, and whatever of those fragments are loose, extract and remove them, and whatever of them are not loose and are pricking the limb and causing pain, then cut and extract them in every way you can.
If inflammation or gangrene or another type of corruption and putrefaction occurs to the wound, it is necessary to address each symptom of it with something similar to the treatment that was previously described in its chapter.
And among what you should pay attention to my words and keep in mind is if a large bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur bone, the humerus bone, and the like of the large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it, for death often results from that, rather leave it until it putrefies, for it may fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days, then at that time treat the wound if you see a place for treatment in it, otherwise leave it.
Chapter Twenty on the treatment of the complication that occurs after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially near the joints, which deforms the shape of the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Look, if the complication is soft, then use astringent medicines in it, such as aloe vera, frankincense, myrrh, spikenard, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup or with egg white or with vinegar, and apply it to the complication in a poultice and tie it tightly and leave the bandage without loosening it for many days, then loosen it and repeat it until the complication is gone, God willing.
Or tighten a plate of sealed lead on it, because lead has a property that removes everything that protrudes in the limbs.
If the complication has hardened and intensified, and necessity urges its removal, then incise it from above and cut off the protruding excess or scrape it with some scrapers until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter twenty-one on the treatment of a fracture if it has healed and the limb remains.
After that, it becomes thin, unlike its original nature, if the bone fracture heals, and the limb remains thin and weak, then this is due to many reasons, one of which is either due to the frequent loosening of the ligaments and tying them in a way that is not appropriate. وإمّا لإفراط شدّ الرباطات حتّى امتنع الغذاء أن يسرى الى العضو
And the treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until the blood increases in it, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so on.
Then apply tar to the limb so that the tar attracts a lot of nourishment to it, or continue suspending/dangling it with lukewarm water until the nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two on the Treatment of Broken Bones if They Are Set Crooked ومنعت فعلها على ما ينبغى
So when a limb that has been set after its healing exhibits a curvature or a protrusion of the broken bone, or a knotting, and the appearance of the limb is thus disfigured, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function. فليس ينبغى أن تقبل قول من يزعم أن يكسر العضو من رأس وقد كان كثير من جهّال الأطبّاء والمجبّرين يفعلون ذلك فى بلدنا وهذا الفعل مذموم جدّا يؤدّى الى غرر عظيم أيسره العطب
But if the curvature and knotting are soft, then it should be fomented with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and so on, and it should be dressed with softening dressings such as well-made diachylon.
Or marshmallow root mucilage should be taken and mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil, and it should be dressed with it.
Or fatty figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung, and similar medications that are called dissolvers of healing.
And the knotting may be dissolved by constant gentle massage done with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the curvature is old and severe and hardened, and necessity calls for its treatment with iron, then it should be incised at its top and the connection of the bone should be released, and the excess of knotting or bone should be cut with gentle cuts, and gentleness should be employed in this with effort and care.
Then the wound should be treated with what has been mentioned previously until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three on the Discussion of the Jaw
The jaw is a joint's dislocation from its place, thus hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe aches and pains to the patient.
So when a jaw dislocation occurs to someone, it is necessary to immediately reduce it without any delay, because if it is delayed, the place swells, making it difficult to reduce the jaw.
Therefore, it shouldn't be delayed, moved, or extended while it is swollen because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately phlebotomize the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then wash the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently and treat each limb with what will be mentioned in its place.
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what was previously mentioned regarding fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw
Rarely do the jaws dislocate except in rare cases.
And their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: إمّا أن يزولا عن مواضعهما زوالا يسيرا فيسترخيا قليلا
So if the dislocation is slight, it may return to its place on its own in most cases with minimal effort.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.
This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside his mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side, or inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and with the rest of his fingers on the outside, he adjusts it and orders the patient to relax his jaw and let it go in every direction, and the physician adjusts and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, use a compress with hot water and oil until their reduction is easy, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.
So when they have returned and straightened and the patient's mouth has closed and they do not relax, then place on them pads of cloth with cerate made from wax and rose oil, then tie them gently with a loose bandage.
And the patient should sleep on his back with his head supported between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not strain to chew anything, but makes his food a soft soup. حتّى اذا ذهب الألم وانعقد الفكّ فليأكل ما بدا له
And let him do that gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is firm and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often occur from that, and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
So if you see that, know that he is damaged, and often one who experiences that dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five on the Reduction of the Dislocation of the Clavicle and the Tip of the Shoulder
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest. وقد تنفكّ الى خارج ويتبيّن ذلك للحسّ
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms, then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return.
Then you put on it the bandage and the supports and tighten them.
As for its end, which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely. فإن انخلع يوما مّا فينبغى أن يردّ ويسوّى على ما ذكرنا وما يتهيّأ لك
Then put on it the bandage, the supports, and the tightening, and instruct the patient to maintain rest and stillness until he recovers.
With this same treatment, you reduce the end of the shoulder if it also moves from its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six on Reducing a Dislocated Shoulder
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways, one of which is that it dislocates downwards towards the armpit
and the second is that it dislocates towards the chest وربّما انفكّ الى فوق المنكب وذلك يكون فى الندرة
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the scapula ولا ينفكّ الى قدّام لمكان العصب
And it mostly dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them
But as for those who have much flesh, it is the opposite of that, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty
And sometimes a person experiences a blow or a fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so it is thought that it has dislocated, so it is necessary to examine it until you ascertain its truth, and then proceed with its treatment
The dislocation is recognized, if it is downwards towards the armpit, if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy shoulder, for you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder with a curvature, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the shoulder is like an egg, and the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements
Likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that obvious to the touch, not hidden
This dislocation may be easy to reduce if it is fresh or if the patient is a child
Its reduction is that an assistant raises his hand upwards, then you place your two thumbs under his armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards, then lowers it downwards, and it will return quickly
If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been there for many days, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in hot water and to use the emollient that softens and relaxes, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and using it
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderate between soft and firm, then the physician places his heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand with his hand, and extends it downwards, and pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place
And if you wish, reduce it in this way, which is that you bring a man taller than the patient and have him stand by the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lifts his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down to his lower abdomen, and if the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something else on him to weigh him down, and the dislocation will return immediately
It may also be reduced in another way, which is to fix a long piece of wood in the ground, the top of which is round like the bottom of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after you place a soft cloth on the top of the wood, and the patient is standing along the wood, then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side with force, and the joint will return to its place quickly
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment, which is to take a piece of wood about two cubits long, four fingers wide, and two fingers thick, with a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit, in this way:
Then soft rags are tied on the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient.
Then it is placed under the armpit and the entire hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied on the upper arm, forearm, and the edge of the hand.
Then the arm is placed horizontally on the rung of a ladder and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, for the joint will enter immediately.
Once it has entered, by whatever means possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit. ثمّ يحمل الضماد المهيّأ من غبار الرحى مع اللبان وبياض البيض على المنكب كلّه كما يدور من فوق
Then the ball is tightened firmly from under the armpit, and it is rotated with the bandage on the poultice from above, and his hand is hung to his neck, and he is left without moving his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be made little until the limb strengthens, for it is faster for his recovery.
Then it is loosened after seven or five days, and he is trained in movement, and if it is stable and does not relax, then he has recovered.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture affecting it or another ailment, then it is necessary to use cauterization with the three needles as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.
If you have done all of this, and loosened the bandage after seven days and the joint did not stabilize, and you repeated the poultice and tightening on it several times, and it did not stabilize and fell and relaxed, and you were unable to raise it upwards, then know that its nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, or stretched, or relaxed. فاعلم حينئذ أنّ المفصل لا يثبت فى موضعه أبدا،
As for the dislocation that is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.
And all the tightening and treatment is used on it until it heals.
If after healing there appears a stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement, then let the patient use the bath frequently until that stiffness softens and it returns to its original state.
Chapter twenty-seven on the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty, and it dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is located under the sight and under the touch, in whatever form it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this will be clear to you with a clear explanation by the concavity of the joint, and he cannot bend his arm nor touch his shoulder with it.
And it is necessary to hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling occurs to it, because if a hot swelling occurs to it, it will be difficult to reduce it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward, because it is the worst of all types of dislocation and the most severe in pain, and death often occurs with it.
And its treatment, if it is possible to return it, is that an assistant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are from above the elbow and from below it, and he pushes the joint with both his thumbs or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be returned by bending the hand suddenly until it strikes with the base of its palm the shoulder that it faces.
If the dislocation does not respond to returning, then use very strong and powerful extension, which is that two assistants extend the arm and two assistants hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension, then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage on his hand.
And when the physician handles the joint with his hands, he wipes it with oil so that it helps in sliding the joint easily, then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns.
And after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage on it that contains astringent and drying properties with egg white, and tighten it firmly, and suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for days, then loosen it. If the joint is stable in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see that the joint has not become firm yet, then repeat the bandage and the binding and leave it also for days until it becomes firm, then loosen it.
If stiffness occurs to it after the return of the joint and its loosening and difficulty in movement, then let him use moisturizing in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens, or place the tail of a fat ram on the joint, then tie it and leave it on him for a day and a night, then remove it and let him enter the bath. فإذا عرق فاعرك المفصل عركا معتدلا ثمّ أعد عليه الألية مرّة وثانية وثالثة مع دخول الحمّام حتّى يلين،
And if you want to put on it fresh, soft cow dung with ghee and tighten it on him, do that several times, because it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter twenty-eight on the treatment of dislocation of the wrist.
The wrist joint frequently dislocates.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy, unlike other joints. إلّا أنّه ينبغى أن يسرع بردّ فكّه الساعة التى ينفكّ فيها قبل أن يرم الموضع او يعرض فيه ورم حارّ.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the wrist of the ill person on a board and an assistant extends his hand and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns.
Except that it is necessary to look, if the dislocation has shifted towards the inside of the hand, then let the ill person place the back of his hand on the board during the extension and reduction. وإن كان الفكّ بارزا الى ظاهر اليد فليكن وضع يده الباطنة على اللوح لتقع يد الطبيب على نفس نتو المفصل.
And if it returns immediately (well and good), otherwise tighten it with a bandage that soothes the swelling and leave it, do not return to it, because it does not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after days have passed for it.
Except that the joint remains in its crookedness and does not harm the ill person at all, except if the hand becomes loose and is unable to grasp anything. فحينئذ تعلم أنّ العصب انقطع او ترضّض فلا حيلة فيه إلّا أن يشدّ بالكىّ فربّما نفع وربّما لم ينفع ذلك شيئا.
So if the reduction of the wrist is completed, then apply to it the bandage that we described, then it is tightened and left for five days, then it is loosened, and the hand is exercised.
And if its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, then soften it with heated water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine on the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.
So when a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place).
Then, bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction to which it was dislocated and leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it straightens itself on that day.
If you tied it at night in the same manner, continue to untie it during the day and exercise it with movement and tie it at night, doing that for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same with it if it dislocates towards the palm of the hand, tie it towards the same direction and do with it what you did before until it heals.
And do the same with it whenever it dislocates in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Vertebrae of the Back
When a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death comes quickly to the patient,
And a sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily, he cannot hold it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them.
But if one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often shifts, and its shifting can be in four directions, and the one that shifts backward is called a hump.
And as for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor any cure at all.
But as for the one that occurred from a fall or a blow and the like, the ancients mentioned it with various kinds of treatment in lengthy discourse, most of which is not beneficial, and I have summarized from that what little suffices for much of what they brought, from my approaching the meaning and my explanation of it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and illustrated.
So I say that the hump that occurs from the front in the chest, there is no remedy for it, nor any cure from it, and likewise the one that is to the two sides also, but only the one that occurs in the back is treated, especially with what I am describing.
It is that you lay the patient on his face on a level bench near a wall and spread a soft padding under him so that his chest is not harmed, then you place a standing plank planted in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench towards his head, and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the bench, and an assistant holds the plank, and let it not be fixed in the hole, and another assistant holds the other in that manner, then you wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage and extend the end of the bandage to the plank that is at his head and tie it there, then you tighten with another bandage over his hips and over his knees and at his ankles, then you gather all the bandages and tie them to the other plank that is at his feet, then each assistant pulls the plank towards his side with the bandage, and the two planks do not move from their planted positions except that they are not fixed as we said, and the physician places his palms on the vertebra with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns.
If it does not return with this treatment, then you take a board whose length is about three cubits and dig in the wall that we said should be near the patient a place into which the end of the board is inserted, then you place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls well until he presses the vertebra and it returns to its place.
And if you wish to do it with the screw that is turned by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the patient's head at the end of the bench two planks whose length is a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the bench also two planks, and let the distance between each plank be a span, and a hole has been made in each plank in which the screw runs, and all the planks are well fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all, and you insert a rounded stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks, and at its end is a hole in which a stick a span long has been fixed with what it twists, and in the other two planks the same.
Then you tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw that is at his feet.
Then an assistant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the turner with which the screw is twisted, and the physician straightens the hump as we have described.
And this is a picture of the screw, the bench, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place becomes level, it is necessary to apply the dried dressing with egg white. ثمّ المشاقة
Then it is tied with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers.
If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, it is necessary to use the medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the board that we described for a long time. وقد تستعمل فى ذلك صفيحة رصاص
And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has protruded, so do not treat it with this treatment, for death may occur.
Chapter thirty-one on the treatment of dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to other joints of slight displacement and concavity.
And the hip joint dislocates in four ways, that is, it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward, and it most often dislocates inward, and rarely dislocates forward or backward.
And the sign of its dislocation inward is that if you compare the healthy leg of the patient with the diseased one, it will be longer, and the knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area next to the groin will be swollen, a clear swelling, because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation outward is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation forward is that he extends his leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain being in the knee, and if he intends to walk, he cannot do so forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, his weight is on his heel.
And the sign of that which is subject to dislocation backward is that he does not extend the knee, and he cannot bend it before he bends the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other, and the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin.
As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, it is that you look; if the dislocation is old, it has become chronic with its owner, and he has not tried to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is no treatment at all, so you should not deal with it.
As for he whose dislocation is recent, and whatever type it may be of the four ways of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward and move it right and left, perhaps it will return and will not need any other treatment.
If it does not return like this, then you should prepare a strong servant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another servant will extend him from above by putting his hands under his armpits, then he will tighten a soft bandage on the origin of the thigh, and a third servant will hold the end of the bandage, and his extension will be either from the front from the groin to the collarbone or from the back to the back.
And their extension will all be at once until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended.
For this type of extension is a common type for the four types.
If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type must have the special treatment that I mention.
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then you place a bandage on the origin of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area under the groin, then you extend the bandage upward from the groin to the upper body to the collarbone, then another strong servant takes with his arms and embraces the thick area of the diseased thigh and extends it outward with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees, and the distance between each one of them should be the length of four fingers, and the diseased leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.
Then the patient is suspended from the head by a wooden beam that is in the house, and its distance from the ground is the length of two arms, then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the femur, and another boy will hold onto the patient, and the other boy who is embracing the femur will push strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly.
As for its special reduction if the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on the bench according to what we described for the hunchback, and tighten the bandage on his diseased leg especially and on his chest, then two wooden beams are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional wooden beam is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened, with a wet cloth wrapped around it so as not to hurt the patient, so that the beam is between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downward during the extension.
Then each servant extends to his side and the physician straightens the hip with his hands.
If it responds to the return, otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.
And if the dislocation is forward, then you should extend the patient's leg at once, while he is in this very description on the bench, and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the diseased groin, then he presses it with the other hand, and with that, the pressure is extended downward to the knee.
And if the dislocation is backward, it should not be extended downward while it is raised from the ground, but it should be placed on something solid, as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench, and he is on his face, and the bandages are tightened as we said before, and the compression with the board should also be used on the place where the joint came out.
When the hip joint returns completely as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs; if you see them level and the patient grasps and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tighten it with a turban so tightly that the hip does not move to any side, and the patient must remain still for three or four days, then untie the bandage, and compare the leg with the other.
If you see them equal in size, then know that the dislocation has healed, so allow the patient to walk.
And if you see some relaxation in it, then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening and leave it for three days as well, then untie it and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens well, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two on the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three directions: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards, I mean backwards, and it does not dislocate forwards at all.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh, and if it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the treatment of all its dislocations is that you sit the patient down, having extended his legs, if he is able to do that, and you sit a servant behind him to hold his waist and twist it backwards a little, then you sit on his thighs, putting your back to his face, and you put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking them between your fingers on his knee, then you squeeze both sides of his knee with your palms strongly, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the thigh softly, without force.
Then bandage it, and stick the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.
And he should not engage in anything except a little walking for some days, until it strengthens.
If its return is difficult for you with what we described, otherwise, use strong extension with the bandages that I previously described for the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter thirty-three on the treatment of dislocated heel.
The heel bone may be slightly displaced. وقد ينفكّ على الكمال
The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce. وهو أن يمدّ برفق بالأيدى ويسوّى حتّى يرجع
As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated فينبغى أن تجلس العليل قاعدا
Then you take hold of his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand then with your left hand twice.
Then extend it with the left hand and push the dorsum of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without force, you do this twice as we have described.
Then push the dorsum of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull at the ankle.
If it returns (to its place) in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot leveled
otherwise repeat the procedure, it will return.
If its return is prevented using what we have described وإلّا فأضجع العليل على ظهره على الأرض وأغرز وتدا فى الأرض موثّقا جدّا ليقع بين فخذيه وقد لففت عليه خرقا لئلّا يؤذى العليل
Then an assistant secures his thigh. ثمّ يمدّ خادم آخر الرجل إمّا بيديه وإمّا برباط يربطه على عنق الرجل
Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands and another assistant holds the healthy leg down. فإنّ الفكّ يرجع بسرعة
So when the dislocation returns and you are certain of its return, apply the bandage and the splint and tighten it with firm bandages and tie the foot with the bandage downwards.
It is necessary to avoid the tendon that is above the heel from behind so that the bandage is not tight on it and harms it.
Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it.
Then release it on the third or fourth day. ويمتنع العليل من المشى أربعين يوما
If he experiences a hot swelling, it is necessary to use in its soothing what we have previously described in another place of treatment and softening until it disappears.
Chapter thirty-four on the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It is appropriate that you straighten what has become dislocated from it with a gentle extension, without violence, and this is not difficult, but easy.
If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot, then it is appropriate that the patient place his foot on a level place on the ground or on a board while he is standing like someone walking.
Then stand yourself and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints, then tread on it with your foot with force until it returns and you see that it has straightened, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the whole foot, which has two ends, then tighten it with a tight and firm binding for three days, then loosen it and protect him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured of no recurrence, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five: On the types of jaw dislocation that occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both of them.
Whenever something like this happens, and you intend to treat it and fix it, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should attempt to treat such a thing except someone who is skilled in the craft, long-experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor daring.
And he should use, in the beginning, only the medicines that soothe hot swellings and entrust the sick person to fate - God willing - except for what you hope for his safety from damage, along with the mildness of the illness and you see in it some hope.
So send him away immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs, and if the limb returns to what you wanted, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments.
If the jaw is fractured and bone fragments that are loose occur, then extract them and follow in that what we mentioned in simple diseases from what preceded in their places.
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of risks, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your honor, God willing.
