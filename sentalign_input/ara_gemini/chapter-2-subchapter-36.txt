Chapter thirty-six on the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and what grows in the throat from other swellings.
Swellings resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils, may occur inside the throat.
If you treat them with what I mentioned in the chapter and they do not heal, then observe: if the swelling is hard, livid in color, and has little sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.
And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not touch it with an instrument either, for fear of bleeding.
Rather, leave it until it ripens, so that you either lance it or it bursts on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is the one that should be cut.
And the procedure for it is that you look before the operation, if its hot swelling has subsided completely or decreased somewhat, then you should sit the patient beside the sun with his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and take an assistant to stand in front of you to press his tongue down with an instrument like this image:
It is made of silver or copper, and it is thin like a knife.
So when you press the tongue with it, and the swelling becomes clear to you, and your sight falls upon it
then take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then you cut it with an instrument of this form:
it resembles scissors except that its two ends are curved.
The mouth of each one of them, next to the other, is very sharp.
It is made from Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is not available
Otherwise, cut it with a scalpel
This is its picture/form:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other side,
So after you cut one tonsil, you cut the other one in the same way,
Then after the cutting, the patient gargles with cold water or vinegar and water,
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops
then treat him until he recovers.
And other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and you cut them in the same way as I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, tending towards numbness, with little sensation, which almost blocked the throat
and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage
and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water
and she was close to death if she had remained a day or two
and two branches had risen from the tumor until they came out of her nostrils
so I hurried and inserted a hook into one of them
then I pulled it and a good piece was pulled out of it
then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril
then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril
then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue
then I inserted the hook into the tumor itself
then I cut some of it
and only a little blood flowed from it
So the woman's throat was opened
and she immediately started drinking water
then she took some food
so we continued to cut from that tumor repeatedly for a long time
and the tumor would replace what was cut
until this went on for a long time with me and her
So I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat from above
so it stopped growing
then I traveled away from the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.
