The eighth chapter on the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist and may be dry.
It is necessary to grasp them with tweezers or a hook and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle lenticular cautery iron.
And cauterizing it is better after cutting.
And often they return if anything of their roots remains.
And if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
