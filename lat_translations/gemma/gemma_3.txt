Praefatio.	Prefatory Note.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book which is the last of my works on medicine, completed with the aid of your contributions, I have reached the end of my studies and pronouncements, and I have undertaken to complete it with this treatise which is a part of the art of surgery, that is, medicine with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery in our age is a work of the hands which is being neglected in our times, and since its secrets have vanished from the world, except for brief accounts in the ancient books which have become altered by the hands of men: and there has arisen from this an error and hesitation, until the intentions of the art have been closed and its spirit prolonged: It is necessary for me to bring together in this treatise the order of this art according to its position and pronouncements, and its abbreviations: and to explain the forms of the instruments of cautery and other implements of surgery, in accordance with the pronouncements and their preparation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why one does not find a perfect artist of this kind in our age is that the art of medicine is vast, and the author must be exercised in the science of anatomy before he can understand the movements of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and their separation, and to have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and lacerations, and their number, and their exit, and the pulsation of veins, and quietus, and the loci of their exits
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said that the name is great when the work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already mentioned this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will cause harm to men: as I have seen many of them who have learned from this science and practice it without science or experience
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is this, because I saw the doctor seize the scrofula from the woman's throat and it caused some arteries in the throat to burst: why did the woman's blood flow until she died between her hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from the bladder, which was in the bladder, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	It came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder's husk
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who took charge of a certain Duke of our land because of a disease: and it happened to a black slave who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with nails and pins, and did not allow the wound to drain.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him for a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the ligament: and he remained like that until the bone of his leg and his foot were completely decayed, and he came to his end
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I advised him to loosen the ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But indeed corruption was confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore the corruption ceased to walk in the limb until it perished
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who perforated a cancerous tumor: and it ulcerated after days, until the malice of the disease increased with the master himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	When the cancer is pure and exudes from melancholic humour, it is not permissible to leave it with iron altogether, except in the case where it is in a member that can tolerate it, in which case it should be entirely excised.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And thus, my son, you must know that an operation which is associated with safety is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which carries the peril in various positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	I am excited about all the places in this book where the operation is mentioned, which is fraught with terror and fear
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, you must be cautious about this, and be humble: so that you do not speak arrogantly, and become dishonest
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Accept now measure with humility and protection, and the sick with facility and firmness, and utilize the gentler method which carries greater benefit, giving thanks to God for the success and praiseworthy outcome: and dismiss the terrifying diseases which are difficult to heal: and take away the spirits of those who fear them, so that there should arise in you trust in your work and comfort in your soul
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For in this world there remains a lasting memorial to your glory, and a fragrance in this world, and finally in your numbers.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen thus said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You do not cure a bad disease: do not give a bad name to the doctor
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have, however, divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cautery with fire, and cautery with acute medicine, a chapter, and arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of instruments and materials for cautery: and everything that is necessary for the operation
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, bleeding, and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and matters of a like nature: and the whole of this chapter is arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and matters of a like nature: this chapter is arranged from the head to the feet, and concerning the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the application of a dressing, and the use of the cautery: and in what complexion it is suitable, and when: and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before any operation is undertaken, it is necessary to state the quality of the dressing and instruments to be used: and in what complexion it should be displayed
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery dressing and its instrument is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and secret discourse.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And it has been said by many learned men, and they have differed in their opinion: and indeed little is sufficient from their discourses, fearing the length of the matter
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that the cautery is applicable to all complexions, that is, with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagree
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the Cauterium is used for incisions.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others have said the opposite, namely that the Cauterium is unsuitable for wounds due to their heat and dryness: for fire is by its nature hot, and it is unsuitable to heal wounds by heat and dryness when they require warmth and moisture.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And some have said the opposite of that: that the Cauterium makes incisions in all wounds which arise in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man to the heat of the fire, you find the body of a man to be cold to the touch
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I myself have observed in practice that it is often useful
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is true that in some cases the Cauterium is useful. However, it should not be used without prior experience and a thorough understanding of the various types of wounds, their causes and symptoms, and the time required for their healing.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Except in the case of very severe wounds, there is no reason to fear the Cauterium: and especially in wounds that are cold and wet.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	I have observed that all doctors concur in their use of the Cauterium in such cases.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	Note that the Cauterium is safe when used with fire and promotes healing along with medicinal herbs: for fire is simple, and its action does not extend beyond the part which is cauterized; and it does not harm any other connected member, except for a slight burning sensation.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The medicinal properties of the burn do not extend beyond the part which is cauterized: and it may even cause difficulty in the healing of the wound, and even death.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its matter, does not do this unless it is excessive
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is done in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But that is done in few.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But that is done in few.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But that is done in few
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is done in few
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	But that is done in few
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But that is done in few
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	But that is done in few
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	But that is done in few
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	But that is done in few
Caput II.	But that is done in few
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	But that is done in few
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: first of all, the physician should evacuate the patient with a solution of urine that will alter the head for three nights, or four, as the nature of the patient's ailment, age, and habits demand.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a circular burn on the head with a needle
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, so that his hands are placed over his belly
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then put the root of your thumb on the root of his nose between his eyes
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever his middle finger reaches, that is the place to make the burn.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then ignite the Cauterium Oil: thus is its shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the designated place with the burn, with a gradual descending movement, until your hand is grasped, and then withdraw it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that there is already a quantity of hair equal to the head or the nails, then lift your hand immediately
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the process with the iron alone, or with something else if it becomes cold: until you see the bones, as I have told you
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it, and put it on the place: and keep it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on it a buttered dressing, and remove the burn from the place until the eschar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more advantageous.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	Some have said that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and the cautery should be retained until the substance of the bone has hardened
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is withdrawn after that which has been cast off from the bone, and it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Others say that the cautery should be continued until it makes an imprint in the bone, so that the bone breaks, like the form of a chisel, or like the instrument which women put into the bath with a small letter: and they say that from this place arise vapors of the head, and the wound remains open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cured, until the fracture is consolidated
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	I, however, do not approve of two kinds of cautery in general, except in some people according to their fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And I send it away, for with me it is better for the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head grows weak from the continuity of its natural solution: as we have witnessed in the rest of the limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is weak by nature: and the first kind of cautery is more safe and better for me than the other, and it is useful: to work with it for the health of the patient
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In the case of cauterizing the head in the case of general pain of the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain in the whole head: and it persists in the patient, and boils, and abscesses, and headaches, and ointments, and applications are used
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	If, therefore, the burn has been cauterized with one cautery, as we have said, and nothing further adheres to it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	If the patient's head is strong in nature and not weak, and he experiences a feeling of heat: then reburn with another cautery under that.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then burn the entire circumference of the head with the cautery, but do not pass through the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone as we have said.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	Burn the cautery once on the back of the head in the place which is called the uas: for that is the place where the bone is placed. Raise the burn upwards in this way, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The patient feels pain because of this heat, and different from the pain of the other cauteries of the head in general.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	I say this: The cautery is to be applied in this place: the horns of the head are to be cauterized with one cautery, while the back of the head is to be cauterized with a finer cautery.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In the treatment of hemophilia, both with medicinal herbs and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in any part of the head, or if the pain extends as far as the eye, and it evacuates with physicians who apply soothing remedies to the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the treatise on diseases, and nothing more: then the burning in this case is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The burning with acute burning medicine is as follows: take a tooth of another, and burn the area with it, and remove the extremities from both sides
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then sever the place of pain at the time with a wide lancet, until it be made in that place under the skin, where the teeth capture.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it thus into the very under-skin, until it is hidden: then tighten above it with a thread of constriction of a fair measure, and keep it bound for fifteen hours. Then take it away, and evacuate the wound for two or three days. Afterwards place above it the lower part of the limb submerged in butter, until the place has yielded pus: then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you do this with some physicians who are learned in burn injuries, whom I have written about in the twelfth tractate on physicians who are learned in burns.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it is like this with iron.</start_of_turn>
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The iron for the cautery, which is like this in shape.</start_of_turn>
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Claudius: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it above the place, and hold your hand: and withdraw the iron gradually with speed: and let the quantity which is to be cauterized from the thickness of the skin be like half of it.</start_of_turn
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that it does not burn the artery which is beneath, and that the flow of blood does not increase.</start_of_turn
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the limb in salt-water, and place it above the place, and leave it for three days: then place the limb in butter: afterwards care for it with ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half-circle with the second extremity of the cautery.</start_of_turn
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And indeed from the incision of the artery in this hemisphere, not in the former manner.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	And indeed from the incision of the artery in this hemisphere, not in the former manner.
Caput V.	And indeed from the incision of the artery in this hemisphere, not in the former manner.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a hemiplegia, when you have done what we said concerning the treatment of preceding diseases, and when you have said concerning the methods of treatment, and it does not suffice: then you must cauterize the tissue with a needle until it turns white when you touch it at the place of the pain with a line whose length is half of a digit, or as much as that: and lay your hand aside and grasp the needle until you have cut through the artery, and hold it until you reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	It is true that you must take care that you do not cause the continuation of the mandible to move during mastication, neither to become hardened, or the nerve which moves it, from which the spasm arises.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be careful of the safety of the flow of blood in the artery that has been cut
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of this and is not studious, or not an expert: and he departs from the operation at once.</start_of_turn>
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with the reminder of the regimen of the flow of blood that has occurred from the artery according to its custom, and in its place here in this book.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you are aware of the disease that does not suffice with this Cauterium, and if you are aware that the body of the patient tolerates Cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have said, then take care of the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if necessary, administer Cauterium, as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with Cauterium having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	It is better to cauterize than to leave it open.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	As to the cauterization of the ear in pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens in the ear pain from cold, and it is cured with solutions, and the rest of the treatment as we have said in the previous discourse, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite Cauterium: and that is what is called the Punctum, which has this shape
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then burn the Punctum with this after its ignition around the entire ear, as it is rotated: or around both sides, if the pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And prolong it with Cauterium to the root of the ear beside, after you have marked the place with the burn: and let the quantity of Cauterium be ten points in each ear, and as much as that
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	As to the cauterization of a burn
Caput VII.	Chapter VII
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A burn which is cured by cauterization is not except from those which arise from phlegm, as we have said in the discourse on diseases
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And you must cauterize the species which arise from exiccation and nervous spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you have cured this species of burn with urine, and saffron, and blisters, and the cure does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the diseased part with three Cauteriums: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from its edge, and the third at the junction of the two lips
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite side of the lower part which is diseased.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the softening does not take place, unless in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	The form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery itself at the direct extremity of the upper ear under the horn of the head somewhat: and at the same time in the temple: whose length is as long as the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until the quantity of middle part of the thickness of the skin is burned
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	This is the form of the cautery, and it is like a knife, whose shape is like this: truly it is not finer than that of a needle: and it must be that the knife is in that place somewhat superficial
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, with that which went before: until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Thus the cautery is to be used in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the ancient apoplexy has become chronic, and when your medicine has not been of avail, and the sick man does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over all the horns of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the back of the head, as we have said before: and the manner of cautery is as we have said before
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also to be cauterized with the cautery over the bones of the stomach: and this is the last method.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the patient, as we have said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Thus the cautery is to be used in oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	The head should be placed in the first place in the bath, and the nourishing pills should be given to the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then the whole head of the patient should be washed, and upon the crown of his head should be placed a compress of rue described in the treatise on compresses: and let him put it on several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the manner of the Cautery: and do this according to the order which I have said above.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and put between every cautery the breadth of a finger
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the cauteries, as has been said before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	And if you wish to make an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if you wish to make an addition: then cauterize the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of it, until he is healed: and let the cautery be done according to its form, as has been said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Thus cauterize in Paralysis, and for mollification.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	You must proceed in the treatment of the head with oil, and as has been said above
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then wash the head of the patient: then cauterize the middle of the head, and the cautery on every horn of the head, and the cautery on the back of his head, and three on the bones of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, the digestion is difficult in the inflammation of the body because of the numerous bodies, and the patient is tolerant, and the inflammation is strong: then burn it with four burnings over the spines of the back, and the last one with the fourth, until it is consumed from the utmost part of it, and lift up your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it is healed: and thus burn olive oil.

Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic patient is not to be burned, except for that in whom the epilepsy proceeds from phlegm.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore to temper the brain of him in the first place with herbs, and with the rest of the treatment as we have said in the preceding discourse: when the patient is great, or is tolerant in receiving the medicines.</start_of_turn
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If, however, he is a child, who does not tolerate the medicines, then is administered a gargling and nourishing of the brain with food for many days before the benefit of the nourishment of the body.</start_of_turn
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then temper his head, afterwards burn it with one burning in the middle of the head, as we have said before in the manner: and with another burning on the back of his head, and over all the hair of his head burn with a third burning.</start_of_turn
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	And if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then burn it with burnings, which I have said in the case of paralysis, and mollification of the body over the spines of the neck and the spines of the back: and let the burning be with olive oil as before.</start_of_turn
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If, however, the patient is a child, then place the burning under cover, according to this method.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cauterization in Melancholia.
Caput XII.	On the method of cauterization in Melancholia.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with cauteries, as we have said in one having paralysis
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	When the cause of melancholy is excessive coldness and leads to melancholy, and the body of the patient is soft and wet, then take from it in the belly what will temper the brain of the patient: as it has been said before in the explanation. Then cut off the head of the patient and make a circle from the entrails of the intestines.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting upright is to be held fast from all sides
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply linimentum.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from old butter or oil
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a tempered fire, as the finger can tolerate when it is introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of the head in a circle, and keep it until it is cold to the touch
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the patient every week once, with the rest of his treatment being good, until he is healed
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you will, cauterize it by making many small punctures of it, besides which you will hold the hand with the cautery: for it will smell badly.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For these are the qualities of cauterization which humectate the brain.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put over it a bandage soaked in butter, or fat from a hen

Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the water in the eye is declared ready by the signs which I mentioned previously, then begin and instill the potion, with that which will modify its head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it away from all moistnesses, and make it sit in a warm bath for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command it to raise its head, and cauterize it in the middle of its head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over two tempora with two cautery instruments: if there is an incipient descent of water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an incipient descent of water in only one eye: and cut away with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be blisters in those which are long in the width of the tempora: and burn from the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	And if anything escapes from it, then immediately cut it away with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting away of them, and care for the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, thick: and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from excessive cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same instrument which I mentioned in the beginning concerning the incipient descent of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cautery instruments over two tempora, and with two cautery instruments in the pupil under two bones
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if digestion is insufficient, then cauterize it throughout all the sides cautiously around the eye, over the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	In the eyebrow region, cauterize cautiously around the eye, over the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you are treating this and it does not yield to medication, as we have mentioned previously, then cleanse it and give the patient three baths at night: then remove its head and cauterize it with a middle-sized cautery, with olive oil cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with two cauteries of claws, over the two eyebrows under the hair somewhat
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And keep away from the artery, so that you do not damage it.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	In the softening of the Palpebrae (eyelids).
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by heat or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, like a lunar cautery
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it over the two eyebrows somewhat with two cauteries in all parts: and extend from two points for two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not put your hand too close to the cautery, but according to the amount that is to be burnt of the third of the eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of cautery in this manner of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	When the hair is burned by the incandescence of the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is of two kinds: either with fire or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, the patient must precede the instrument, so that it may expel its hair, if there are any that move in the area, until the hair is prolonged and even
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, it pricks them at their root: then compress their eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are healed and even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark over the eyelashes with charcoal, according to the figure of a myrtle leaf: and this is the beginning of the mark, close to the hair
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put on a soaked cushion on the edge of the eye: or on the hair of the eyelashes over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then burn the cautery, which is of this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then burn over the figure which you have marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin is burnt, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, throughout.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	The sign of the completion of your work is that if you press the eyeball the eyelashes recoil from the puncture point.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then withdraw your hand: and let it go in three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put on the cushion again with butter, until the eschar has disappeared
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguent until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair remains after an hour, and the eyelashes are softened: then repeat the cautery in the same place as before
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it itself, until they rise to their natural place: and make even so that they do not puncture the eyes.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	In such a case, cauterize with the burning medicine in the same way
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to command the patient to discharge the hair, until they grow long and be made even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from parchment a form like the leaf of myrtle.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from soap known, and from chalk not soaked from any liquid whatsoever a weight of an ounce or almost like that: then smear it together well, and do this with care, so that it does not freeze
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from the palm of your hand the thing which you made like the leaf of myrtle and put it over the eye or eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And put under the eye a bit soaked in albumen or oil: and keep the patient's head in your hand.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And put your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because its biting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	When you have finished this, then discharge the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the biting has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.

When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not settle back in its place within an hour of its dislocation, until it has become accustomed to its return, then it must be reduced by a small movement, as we have seen it happen in other cases: then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation immediately.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is laid on his back, or on the healthy side
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then elevate the skin, which is inside the Tililian space to the upper parts with the left hand digits: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.

Then cauterize with three cautery instruments, a cautery under the breast of the pectoris of quantity equal to one digit with a cautery nail, and two cauteries below from two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries is triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And prolong between each one so that they do not join together, when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery is the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.

And cauterize the stomach by pricking it with that which returns from this cautery: and it is that there are signs above the stomach at the puncture according to quantity, as much as you wish with encasement: then cauterize itself with the cautery of the puncture: then care for it with care which preceded until it is healed

When it happens in the Epa that there is pain from cold and wetness, or from large wind, until it escapes from its natural composition by excessive emission, and the patient is cured, as we said, and does not progress in it: then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his heels, and that signs be made with three cautery instruments according to this figure and this quantity below the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man rests: and let there be space between every two cauteries according to the thickness of a digit: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body of the rectum: and do not press your hand too much with the cautery
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of the ointment which is applied to the roughness of the skin be not added to the middle quantity: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	And if he is not standing, then he is lying down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible that you burn these carbuncles with a cautery knife, when there is skill and prudence in the art
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take heed, that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and that you burn the roughness of the whole skin, for which the whole body is burned, and that it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know well

When the discharge occurs, and you wish to write, if the after-effect is in the liver itself, or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver itself, there is pain, and severity without acuteness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with acute pain that is severe: and know that I say this because it fatigues the physicians of this cure
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the patient lie down on his belly
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the after-effect with the cautery: then you burn the ointment which is assimilated by the rays.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Neither is it proper that any surgeon of this sort should use cautery without having diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for it is by the experience of many that these diseases concur with this operation.
Caput XXXI.	Neither is it proper that any surgeon of this sort should use cautery without having diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for it is by the experience of many that these diseases concur with this operation
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	Neither is it proper that any surgeon of this sort should use cautery without having diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for it is by the experience of many that these diseases concur with this operation. The ancients say that cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisis in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	Neither is it proper that any surgeon of this sort should use cautery without having diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for it is by the experience of many that these diseases concur with this operation. And it is thus that from the dry roots of aristolochia one should take a long root, which is found from among them, and let it be as thick as a digit
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Neither is it proper that any surgeon of this sort should use cautery without having diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for it is by the experience of many that these diseases concur with this operation. Then plunge the root into oil and ignite it with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the place between the continuation of the collarbone and the jaw, and with two small cauteries under guidance slightly depressed to the part which is under the beard
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	Then also with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs depressed downwards to the rear part: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	Then also with three cauteries from behind: one at the place between the two ribs, and two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, the lower cautery being between the two ribs
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	Neither must you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be open and smelling freely
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterization after it has been discharged so that pus is emitted for many days: for this is more conducive to recovery than all the other treatments that follow the care.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	In the treatment of hydrops, care must be taken with the cauterization so that pus is emitted for many days: for this is more conducive to recovery than all the other treatments that follow the care.
Caput XXXIII.	The head is the third part to be treated with cauterization
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not suffice in hydrops unless the vein is severed at the same time.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating hydrops with the methods of care that we have mentioned in the previous section, and the cure does not take hold, then it is necessary to cauterize the four veins surrounding the navel, one above the stomach, one above the spleen, one above the liver, two behind the ribs between the vertebrae, and one in the direct region of the chest, and one in the direct region of the stomach: and the amount of depth of the cauterization should be proportional to the thickness of the skin
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then discharge the cauterization openly so that pus is emitted over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	Do not remove the diseased part from the care after the cauterization: for this will bring two results together: and will hasten the healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery when it is used for the belly is like nails: as it has been described before: and the shape of the cautery when it is used for the back is like olives as it has been described before
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Regarding the treatment of the legs and feet with cautery.
Caput XXXIIII.	The head is the thirty-fourth part to be treated with cauterization
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When swelling appears in hydrops, and the abdomen is filled with citrine urine: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot between the ankle and the heel: and hold your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not move it at all
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The urine is yellow, and the cautery should be performed in this fashion.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make upon each foot two incisions on either side of the ankle, and perform the cautery with the tip of the cautery knife: and perform the cautery along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below the other ankle, approximately in the middle of the leg: and make upon every buttock two incisions: and withdraw the cautery without closure for a long time: until some urine is excreted thereby: then care for the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Thus perform the cautery in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture until the toughness is relaxed and digestion is finished, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cared for with the methods of care and not healed: and the sick person tolerates the excessive heat of the cautery, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what was done in the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, under the ribs, and a cautery on the navel itself, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if the urine moistens the excessive heat, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the loin, and a cautery on every hip: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	There is indeed a useful cure for this, whose method does not err
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Chapter 6. How to cauterize hemorrhoids
Caput XXXVI.	When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture until the toughness is relaxed and digestion is finished, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cared for with the methods of care and not healed: and the sick person tolerates the excessive heat of the cautery, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what was done in the cautery of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauteries around the navel, under the ribs, and a cautery on the navel itself, or two cauteries
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many or one old hemorrhoids, and they are from thick, cold or moist humours, and they do not yield to treatment, then cauterize three times with cautery over the lower part of the spine below the almond-shaped prominence and triangularly around it, and cauterize under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and his food is not digested, and his face is pale and sweating, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, as before: and cauterize over the liver and also over the spleen, with a cautery like a nail: and leave the cautery open for some time: then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	In this way, cauterize the anal opening after its excision.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.</start_of_turn>
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise the anal opening, then burn cautery that absorbs heat.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised anal opening: and pull your last finger until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.</start_of_turn
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many anal openings, then cauterize each one as we have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them, with that which we have said, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the cushion, this is the last thing to do.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	In this way, cauterize the fistula in the anus.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXVIII.	Head Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the diseased part does not obey the section and the work which we have mentioned in its place, and returns to its original position, it is possible that it will heal with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When this happens to any fistula, and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and it softens the corrupted matter
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a fine hook.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its cavity with the hook.</start_of_turn
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply cautery, which is like a rod.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then enter the flame itself into the fistula and the quantity in which the clamp has entered.</start_of_turn
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over the part, until all the corrupted bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard against the burning of nerves, if there are any, or great veins: or if the fistula goes to the belly or to the intestines, then guard against these places.</start_of_turn
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and remember that it is not penetrable.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the matter is removed from it, and remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is fully healed.</start_of_turn
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the matter is not removed from it, then you know that it is penetrable, or that there is a broken bone in its depth, or something like that: of which memory will come to its place.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys that there is pain from cold or from great swelling, and that it diminishes because of that what is diseased, then it is necessary to cauterize the latter over the marrow above the kidneys, cauterizing all the kidneys with the cautery of the claw, which must be preceded by recollection.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we must also cauterize the latter in the same marrow.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	For there will arise three lines.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore will there remain two behind the cautery mark
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	When there is pain in the bladder from cold or from great swelling, and that it diminishes because of that what is diseased, then it is necessary to cauterize the latter over the bone above the bladder, cauterizing the whole bladder with the cautery of the claw, which must be preceded by recollection.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize the lower part of the belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of the cauterization be according to the quantity of the thumb node. And cauterize the lower back, or two cauterizations if necessary: and let it be as the previous cauterization was.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize the lower belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right and left sides: let the length of the cauterization be as great as the thumb joint. And cauterize the lower back, or twice if necessary.
Caput XLI.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize the lower belly above the bladder where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right and left sides: let the length of the cauterization be as great as the thumb joint. And cauterize the lower back, or twice if necessary.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in the treatment of the bladder, and also cauterize the lower back, or twice if necessary.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in the treatment of the bladder, and also cauterize the lower back, or twice if necessary
Caput XLII.	When pain affects the bladder, and swelling from gravel and moisture persists until the patient is unable to retain urine, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in the treatment of the bladder, and also cauterize the lower back, or twice if necessary
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the knee of the Ancha, and this is the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of this is that one thigh is prolonged over the other, when compared to the normal: and the dislocation is found in that part.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	It is necessary therefore that the cautery be applied to the diseased part above the Anchae nut with a cautery of similar size in a circle: when you have signed with the cautery around the circumference of the nut, as it is wont to do: and that the nut itself should fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	The cautery should be of the size which was previously mentioned in the cautering of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present, then you must cauterize with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery: and make the depth of the cautery according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin of the whole
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Regarding the cautering of the sciatica.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the nut of the Anchae, and the cause of it is cold and moisture: and the disease is cured with that which we have mentioned in the treatise, and no other remedy is of use, and the disease persists: then it is necessary to drain the diseased part from the gross humours with poultices of stench, or with artificial pills, or things of that kind.</start_of_turn
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.</start_of_turn
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautering in these two ways: either with the cautery and the burning of drugs, or with fire alone.</start_of_turn
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is in various methods.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is that you cauterize above the Anchae nut with three triangular cauteries, in this shape.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the depth of it well, or little.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there shall be space between every burn of quantity equal to the length of a finger: and let the burn be of olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the burn is made in the middle above the head of the arch of the same.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Because there are four burns.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you burn with a circle, whose form precedes the burn of dislocation of the arch, one: so that it encloses the whole arch
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the manner of burning in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the arch itself, and does not extend until the cox and thigh
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends until the cox and thigh, then burn with two burns on the cox, on the place where the sufferer feels the pain there, and with the fourth burn four fingers wide on the lower side: and let the burn be with a knife
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the burn be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	And if the sufferer says that the pain extends almost up to the toes, then burn there where the pain is felt with a single burn, or three, or four, or as many as are needed there
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he says that the pain is under the knee towards the thigh, then burn there with a single knife burn
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And burn in all your burning, so that you do not reach the nerves or great artery, and that you do not draw down the diseased matter over the sufferer's body, or cause contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I also know of one and another who have burned above the foot, and have finished their burning, and the thigh has swollen, until the whole foot has become swollen, and has burst open, and become corrupted throughout: then there has followed a solution of the belly, and a black fluid has appeared after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain exists in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said concerning cauterization of the anus, that this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a mark like that from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and be at the orifice according to the thickness of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there be within it a third of itself.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there be space between every mark according to the quantity of the thumb knot: and the marks be opened from two parts: and their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make a handle of iron adapted to the center of the marks
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is ignited in fire, until it turns red, and spits out sparks: then it is placed over the abscess inflamed over the healthy side
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Thus do three cauterizations round about in one place
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After that apply butter with ointment: and discharge the wound opened for many days.

Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, concerning this kind of cauterization, we rarely use it, because of the terror of its appearance: and because of this, few people expect it over it
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Indeed, from the good ones it has its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization with physicians is confirmed, so that you make two marks having a perforated arm, in which the kernel of the wrist comes down from the air, or from iron, the length of the wall: whose height be two knots, or like those.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there be space between each two quantities of the length of a finger, and there be openings below and above: and there be that which contain themselves against each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	And lay the thumb upon the heel of the foot, the sick lying upon the broad side of the sound foot
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand upon the heel of the foot much
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	And pour between two circles of hot water, which be heated with fire lightly, and keep it for the quantity of an hour of time: and the sick shall endure the biting of it, and the biting of him, for he himself finds the biting like fire, until the biting ceaseth.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And lift up your hand with the instrument, and wash the hot water from the whole foot with sweet water: and send it away for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put upon it butter, until the black of the wound be removed: and send it away for a few days, and there shall come out of it pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is in the end in the healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	And care for it with unguents, until it be healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extend unto the hip, or the thigh: make for him a bath in which there be water equal to that which thou didst make in the foot.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the manner of hot water: and I have written concerning it in the treatise of the rectification of medicine.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali, and burnt lime of both an equal part: mix them both together and put them into a new vessel, of which the lower part be pierced with a small hole according to the quantity which enters into it: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with water: and pour over the alkali and the lime from sweet water, which shall cover both by a finger: and when thou hast compressed them with thy hand well: and send away the vessel, until the acute water of the lower part of the treated vessel descend.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add the whole water and throw the upper heel over the lower heel: and withdraw until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	The heel is then made strong and acute, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it does the work of the fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the physicians, those who cauterize extensively, such as tessies, and beech gum, and nutgall, and lime with soap, know how to mix both of these together
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself reports that a certain ancient physician, who cured the pain of an ingrown nail and sciatica: and praised his skill.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He also said that it is unnecessary for any other treatment, and that he was cured by a single bath, until he returned, for he himself perhaps dipped into the hot bath, and came out of it already cured
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the green barley of the seer: and if it cannot be found green, take it dry, pounded: and take it often with some fat, and apply it to the ankle, knee, or thigh: and bind it, and leave it for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels its soothing effect
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body is softened by the bath, put it into the bandage
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain disappears, and it is cured
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you know that no other cauterization should be used along with these physicians, except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	Dioscorides also reports that when goat dung is cauterized with the nail of a sciatica, it gives relief: and it does cauterize in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a lancet be taken, and let an ancient oil be drunk, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and between the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and burn it, until it is charcoal
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the lancet and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do this until sensation returns through the middle until the pain has ceased
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the cauterization of the Vaccinum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cauterization of the pain of the back
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back from a wound of many, or from a fracture, or from excessive evacuation, or in like manner, from the infusion of cold and humid material: and the cauterization is not useless, except in this kind alone, which is made from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the patient with foul pills and like things, to make three lines upon the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the palm of the hand, after having signed with the cautery in every line five burnings, or more according to the quantity which comes from the patient's tolerance or the extent of his suffering: and let the cauterization be made with the cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you will, cauterize three or four times with the middle caulking needle, according to this form.

Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Many times this ailment occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs with a tightening of the bowels in inspiration towards elevation, and movement: and you will find it in the last rib and the nodes of the back, which begin to bulge over the rest of the ribs.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have done this, and you wish to make it, then burn it with a cautery in the shape of a circle around this form
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.

When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow upon any part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call this Podagra
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When it is cured by cold causes of Podagra, with the methods of treatment, and not by removing the pain, then the cautery will remove it
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is to be done after the evacuation around the joints of the feet with many cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olive oil

Then put your hand over the place, so that the intestine does not go out: and I will open between the ribs, and put under it powder, and a servant over his ribs, and another over his chest which holds his hand

Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: in such a case one must carefully consider the cautery of it
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, however, the leprosy is severe and does not yield to treatment as we have said above, and does not subside: and times over the patient extends over the whole complexion of the body: then burn over the head five times: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it at the end of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind the nape of the neck
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally touch your hand with the cautery lightly, until it makes an imprint in the bone, and the cortices are dislodged from it: so as to allay the emission of foul vapor from it. And cauterize also the spleen according to what has been said before
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If however leprosy has become sparse on the diseased person and is clearly visible: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with these cauteries which we mentioned at the head, and with cauterization on the extremity of the nose, and with two cauteries on two maxillas, and with two cauteries on two spondyles of the neck, and six on the spondyles of the back, and one large one on the flanks near the great buttocks and one above the very belly: and two on the ankles: namely one on every ankle, and two on the knees, one on every knee, and two on the humeri, and two on the cubits, and two on the tendons of the chest.

Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cauteries, the greater the damage, and the greater the risk.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you know that the sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, just as they do not feel it in health: because the body of him is already stupefied.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries should be of a suitable size, and in number according to the parts and joints: according to what precedes from the kinds of instruments.

Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that. For I fear that it will cause damage. And I have seen this happen many times before.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cautery instruments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the cautery of Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati and it is delayed in maturation, or because of excessive swelling, or because of old age which makes the blood weak, or because of time, and you wish to speed up the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cautery instruments by pricking
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then remove the swelling
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will itself speed up the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then make a small incision with the cautery instrument.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be distant from the infirm from that which follows.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the cautery of a running wound.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A running wound is not except for a corruption in a movable limb, and it consumes it: like fire consumes dry wood
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a running wound in a place where you can apply the cautery with fire, then make many small and large sparks, according to what is convenient in the place where the running wound is
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then burn it thoroughly from all sides until you have removed the entire corruption, and let nothing remain of it inside.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Leave it for three days, and place above the burned area sulfur in powder mixed with oil, until all the carbuncles are eradicated and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Care for it with nourishing poultices of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If, however, after three days, new flesh has grown in a healthy state, without any corruption, that is good
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then burn again the parts that remain of the corrupted areas
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The wounds are treated with acute medicine as needed
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	The burn itself disappears from the place where it was made.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, the burn is faster with fire: and I have already said that the cauterization of that is with acute medicine in its entirety: take it there wherever you wish it, when you wish it there
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	In this way, burn in Clauis and Verucis.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a gross, oozing thing that spoils the foot
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the cauterization of it is in two ways: with fire, and with hot water
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the fire, make the cauterization of the concave surface like the nail of a lizard: which is done with iron, according to the quantity that it contains the limb from all sides: and let it be fine along the edges
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burning iron on the limb
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then draw the hand back with the cautery around the circumference of the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with wool plugs and bandage it with salt: and leave the bandage on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will itself disappear from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place where the tissue has been burned, until it heals
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not congealed, and many of them happen in the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply in it the cautery with warm water: and take a needle from the air, or iron, or from the quill of an ostrich: and place it over the nail, or the splinter
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a little quantity of warm water into the needle: hold your hand firmly, and draw the needle out with pressure, so as to impress the mark of the needle at the root of the nail, and find the warm water at the depth, at the root of the nail: and expect the patient to wait a while above the application of the warm water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with one after the other, until you arrive over all those which are in the body from the cautery
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, with what is generated from the cautery of the flesh
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In this way, cauterizing in Tremore.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from the cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize with the cautery, and in the belly of it cauterize, and over the stomach of it cauterize
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor ceases when the olive oil cautery is applied, and health returns to the cold ailment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The tremor subsides when the olive oil cautery is used, and health returns to the cold ailment.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When the bad blood is expelled from the body of Albathir, that is, pus that arises from corrupted matter
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, in the first place, when they appear, they must be cauterized over every head of the pus with fine cautery made of the branch of myrrh, whose extremity is kindled with fire
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with lenticular cautery
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized diligently, at the beginning of their expulsion, in this way: and they do not grow; they are broken down by excessive flow, and health returns from the heat.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary to perform this after the expulsion with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	How to cauterize in the flow of blood from an artery to a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	When there is a great flow of blood from an artery that has been cut at a wound, which happens either externally or at the base of the wound, or by cautery of a limb, or similar things: and this makes it difficult to close the wound
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone, then take hold of your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger above it: and tighten it much, until the blood stops flowing from under your finger, and does not flow out from there again
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on the fire a few small olive stones and many more in number: and blow over them until they are ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from the jar one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place, where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery on the very wound: after which you withdraw your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is clotted
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the withdrawal of the finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do this until the blood is clotted.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Be careful, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and do not add anything else to the wound.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is great, except with four fingers.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with the cautery, as we have said before.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction, when it is not extracted
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the extremities recoil and the blood is clotted
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed upon it medicines which have the property of clotting blood, and are bound with a tight constriction
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs an excision of it with a ligature, and a tightening with a bandage, or with fire, or other similar things, does not give it sufficient pain, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however it happens to anyone of these, and there is no physician present, neither medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the orifice of the wound, as we have said, and constrict it tightly until the blood is overcome from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger must not be moved, but rather let it rest upon the ice-cold water until the blood congeals, and then it will swell up and be separated.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	Meantime, consider what is needed from the cautery or from medicine in this case.</start_of_turn>

Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter that every ailment which demands the use of either cautery or burning medicine, and which has its causes and its instruments, and the forms of cautery.</start_of_turn

Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, let me remind you, dear son, what was said in the first chapter concerning cautery.</start_of_turn
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore, you must be cautious in this operation, for in this chapter there are many instances where blood flows out excessively with the opening of the vein, or the incision of the skin, or the opening of an abscess, or the draining of a wound, or the extracting of an arrow, or the incision of a stone, and such like: from which all these things are associated with tremor, and fear, and cause a loss of blood in many.</start_of_turn
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not be afraid of this, for in this art as in the art of healing the sick, there is always some danger.</start_of_turn
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	He who is angry with his ailment is like the sea towards him: because of his expectation that he will find from his illness and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	When an ailment is accompanied by fear of death, it is truly terrifying
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from him who takes care of his ailment, and who hopes for his recovery, his ailment itself becomes harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not right that you should consent to the arrival of him from whom comes his ailment.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Be wary of excessive expectation, rather than of love and rapacity
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume that you know more than is proper from him, except after you have learned the certain science which reveals to you what is useful and what is harmful
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	Utilize all the means for the care of all sick people, for prognostication and for the indication of what is beneficial to health
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies your help in acquiring fame and glory, and in memory and praise
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, his son, your intellect, and do not take away from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I, too, have set this chapter apart by chapters, following the order of the Cauterion from the chest down to the feet: so that I may relieve you of the burden which you suffer from, and of which you inquire
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this ailment often occurs in children at the time of birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without lubrication.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	Whenever anything happens, even from an occult cause which is not discerned.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	I have not observed this ailment in others besides children: and concerning all those from whom I have learned, the sea has always been sufficient for them; therefore it seems to me that it is necessary for me to defer the operation in this case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	I have observed among children that when their heads were filled with water and their heads grew large every day, they could not sit on their own because of the size of their heads, and there was an increase in moisture until they died
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	Moisture of this kind either collects between the skin and the bones or accumulates under the bones over the flesh
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	If there is moisture between the skin and bones and the swelling is slight, it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, about the length of two knots, in order to drain the moisture.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the form of the sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If the moisture is much increased and the swelling is great, two incisions should be made, according to this form
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see the edges of the head open from all sides: and the moisture is drained out when you press your hand inwards, without it being hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision drain out all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then stitch the incisions with strips of skin and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then cover this with oil and vinegar until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and attention.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	Do not suspend the tying of the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And bind the diseased limb with little moisture, until it is comfortable and healed
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is when you consider where the swelling of the abscess is great, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is at the back more, or in the cheek, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend gently with the incision where you see the abscess and the collection of water: and cut that as much as you can.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	Observe, that you do not cut an artery, and there is increased flow of blood, and the diseased limb will die from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling occurs to the eyes or to the chest, and it grows old, and no remedy of medicine helps: then the last remedy is the incision of these two arteries
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when you wish to cut easily, that you draw out the diseased head
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then bind the diseased limb with anything that you wish
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both of them are, which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then sign with a burn on each side: and cut each one with a needle as sharp as possible, cutting through to the bone: and do this for the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	If necessary, introduce the sponge inside the vessel and cut the vein above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	The length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which jumps inside frequently
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to be sensible, then it is necessary to measure from the ear to the quantity of three fingers
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a cautery, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole of this is according to the quantity which appears to you from the suffering of the patient and the refilling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains anything to the bone from the soft parts, then cut that, so that no thick swelling remains: then bind up the wound with strips of linen cloth
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with oil, until it is healed
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are in their time
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that an ancient hemorrhage occurs, or an acute catarrh because of acrid humilities and heat in the lacertis of the times, or an old soda, or urine, or similar things: and it is medicated with the methods of treatment of medicine, and it does not suffice: then we are experts in these ailments of the arteries of the times, or in cauterizing them, as we say
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation in the extraction of these is that the sick man grasps the hair which are in the times, and directs it towards the visible artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	The pulse itself is often observed to betray its secrets, and is rarely hidden except among a few men or in cases of great cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden, the sick person tightens his head with any garment he has: then he rubs the place with rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he vaporizes the place with warm water, until his pulse reappears clearly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take sponge, which was before like this form
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then cleanse with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then draw out the thread to the outside, and pull it out from above, until you have drawn out the thread from the skin, and made it retract from the tunic which are under it from all sides
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is fine: then loop the thread with the end of a needle
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And then cut from that part according to the quantity of which the extremities are elongated, and tighten, and the blood flow does not occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not tied off, the blood does not rise fully
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood about six ounces, until three ounces remain
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary that you bind the thread in two places from a double thread, strong, from silk: or from horsehair, so that it does not become putrefied before the wound is consolidated, and the blood flow is restored
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the surplus, which is between two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or after an hour
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if necessary, cauterize the thread with a cautery until it reaches the bone, with a surgical knife: until the extremities have receded from it, and the place of the work is stable.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better work if the patient does not have a fever, or if their complexion is flushed.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For indeed the cautery is an agent which brings about the drying out of humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to treat the patient.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be closed with a cautery in its former state: and that there be placed upon the latter part of the thread which has been made in the middle
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the closing should be cared for with dry medicines which cause the generation of flesh, and with sponges, until the wound is healed
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Should blood flow from the artery meanwhile while you are working, then immediately stop it with the cautery, or tie the place with silk: and press your hand, until the blood is stopped
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these is present, then put over the place your finger, until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embroider the place with cold water, until the pain has ceased, and then bind as seems necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And concerning that which is easier and more convenient for the extraction of an artery, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery which has two blades: and that the pain of the two blades be similar to an almond
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Indeed their pain is much less than that of two blades
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are acute, like two blades, both are subject to cold: and they do not cause the flesh to tear with speed
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And because in the air there is a little of the size of a barleycorn, it is held in the air of the fire and is severed more quickly: with this work is better in all respects, and is easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be space between two knives equal to the length of a finger, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and lay both of them alight until they reach the bone, and they shall penetrate in two places: so as to lengthen that which is between their extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For this cautery does not coagulate deeply.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	About the care of acute tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are acute and flow from the eyes which are above the outer part of the head: and do not cause any medicine with the physicians, and the tears make the face of the patient red, and he feels walking in front like ants: and his eyes are swollen, wet, as if they were eaten away by the scales: and his eyelids are inflamed from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients deemed it necessary in their treatment for these tears to perform an operation, and they called this treatment "Ens.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is necessary to shave the hair on his face for the patient.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions on the forehead equally distant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lower part of the jaws, and the third from the other side: and burn from the arteries which are in the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let there be space from the incision equal to the length of three fingers together: and let there be a sponge prepared, or dry cloth, with which to soak up the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the sponge-bag of two acute extremities, whose shape follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision from the temporal side to the second incision: and scrape the whole skin between the two incisions, with the sponge-bag, which is above the bone
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw the sponge-bag and introduce another instrument into the first incision, which is called the acute knife, from one side gently, not acutely from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the acute edge of it towards the meat attached to the skin, and the gentle side towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle opening: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues from the skin.<start-of-turn>
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle opening until the other opening.<start-of-turn>
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after it has bled out an equal amount, express the place from the clotted blood.<start-of-turn
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place on every incision a bandage of old cotton, and place over that soaked sponges in wine, and wax or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that there be no formation of a soft swelling.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day suture the ligament, and give a plentiful infusion with warm water.<start-of-turn>
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the wound from the marrow, and leave the other wounds to heal: until they are healed.<start-of-turn>
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	As for the care of the acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.<start-of-turn>
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute carbuncles occur, the area, edges and surrounding parts are affected: and the eyes become swollen, small and languid; the aspect is therefore distorted: the palpebrae are ulcerated, hairs fall out from the skin, and there is acute pain in the depth of the head, causing sneezing. Then take note of these signs, for these matters do not arise from carbuncles alone, except from numerous ulcers.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best treatment for these is to take note of these signs.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	It is also proper to shave the patient's face.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision one finger's breadth in the middle of the face, or on the other side across the width, and begin the incision from the left ear to the right ear: and keep the incision down to the bone: and stretch your hand from the edges of the wound, which move with chewing, until the bone is reached: and you will have excised the whole blood with the sponge.</start_of_turn>
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with coarse cotton wool, or with strips of linen.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind up above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that there does not form a thick scab.</start_of_turn
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished with this, and the swelling of the wound has diminished: then it is necessary to compress the bone, until new flesh begins to form in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for yourself with a regimen of nourishment that promotes the healing of the wound: thus as if you were taking from wheat flour two parts and from barley four parts: and prepare from these ingredients a plaster, and administer it to the wound until the flesh has healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the care of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Concerning the care of that which falls into the ear.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every thing that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral substance, like stone, or something like stone, such as iron; or it is vegetable, like cicer and beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water and vinegar, and wax like things; or something animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When such things as stone or other substances of like nature fall into the ear, they expose the ear to the open air: if oil is poured in, let some of the oily liquid be drained out of the ear with the finger or with a tube.</start_of_turn>
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then extract it and make the eardrum taut with conchs; anoint the nostrils above the eardrum, after you have put around the ear a bandage of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many things go out with this care.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If they do not go out, then extract them with tweezers, which are fine like needles: their form is like this.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If they go out with the tweezers, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if they do not go out, extract them with a blunt needle of small size.</start_of_turn
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If they do not go out by this, make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube into the ear very much, and pour oil around the tube with soft wool, so that there be no air except the tube: then draw out with your hand.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many things go out with this treatment.</start_of_turn
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not go out in this way: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the moisture, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are captured, and put it on the extremity of the radius after you have wrapped around it above the ankle that is positioned downwards: then introduce it into the ear opening with ease, after you have expelled the wax from the moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not go out as we have said, then prepare to make an incision, before the swelling becomes hard, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	The way of making the incision is like a vein-cutting in the head: and extract from it from the blood according to the measure of its virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and bring round his ear to the upper part, and find the opening of the ear at the root of the ear towards the cartilage in the depressed place: and make the incision in a semicircular shape, until you reach the bone: then remove it with the instruments
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the incision quickly and diligently, and care for it, until it heals
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If anything falls into the ear from a seed that grows and swells: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out for you, then take a small sponge, fine and subtle, according to this form
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do that when you think that that grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you have put upon it many sponges: then extract it with hooks, or with a fine hand, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction will alleviate it.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	And in water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to cough at first: and immediately put in his ear a little of the old cotton wool: and it is placed upon that ear in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If he goes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	If not: then take many stones, according to the length of the digit, tight, loose, and warm them with fire near, and introduce the sick person through one ear: and let him go out through the other ear, and strike him with a stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water has gone out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water has gone out, take from the fire or from a jug one, and introduce its extremity one into the ear: and raise the other extremity with fire, until most of it is consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the jug with another, and do this many times, until all the water has gone out: and extract it with a tube according to what is promised in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is within the ear, if it is small of the body, like a flea, and the like, take care of it as I have said in the explanation
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of the body that appears to the sense: then manage the extraction of it with the hand, and with hooks: and its matter is easier for all who hold it in the ear
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of the worms generated in the ear, when you have cured it with what we have said in the discourse and in the treatise on distillations, and it does not yield your care: then it is necessary to burn the ear in the sun
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with the hand, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a tube, whose form is like this, strict below, wide above: and introduce the lower extremity into the ear according to the quantity that the sick person tolerates: then draw it out with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times until all worms emerge.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you until they come out, then pour oil around the cannula with earth, as I said on the stone.[start_of_turn]
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	When they do not emerge even with this, then perform distillations, which the ancients were experts in for the elimination of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.[start_of_turn]
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be like that which you pour with oil and medicines into the wound with this instrument, whose form is shown here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Like the wax which you make from silver or gold, tightly closed below, with a small hole above, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the force which is in the concavity of the cannula be made of air centered
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a sponge and moisten the end of it with a coating of the decoction: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the wound: then introduce the sponge with the coat above, and express it out with your hands in a temperate compression, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the ear, and you feel it inside the ear: and what is poured into the wound should be heated with fire immediately: for medicines do not tolerate being distilled when cold.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Of the care of the burn of gold.
Caput VII.	(The provided text continues with the next section of the translation.)
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some infants emerge from the holes of their mothers’ wounds unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes it happens to some people that their ear is burned from the wound, or is born with it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And sometimes this swelling arises in the profound cavity of the Ear, without causing any unusual sensation: and sometimes it occurs on the exterior of the cavity, and causes some unusual sensation.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	And thus that which arises in the profound cavity of the Ear, and which does not comprehend the outward aspect, is difficult to heal in many situations
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And when it causes sensation, the Ear must be placed under a sole, and the swelling must be pressed with a fine sponge: then if the swelling appears to be subsiding, open the opening somewhat with a slight incision, so that its edge may be slightly obtuse, while the remainder of the sponge should be soft on either side, so as not to irritate the Ear
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the swelling is caused by a natural growth of the flesh in the substance of the Ear, then hold it with a fine needle and cut it away with ease until the whole piece of flesh is removed
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the swelling is in the profound part of the Ear, then take a fine needle, soft and heat it with fire: then pass it into the substance of the Ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you sense swelling with this, which causes the patient to suffer from the weight of the hearing, try to open it with ease: and be careful not to injure the nerve of the Ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the Ear a plaster cast according to the quantity of the opening which you have made in the Ear: leave it for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a plaster cast, and moisten it with rosewater, and sprinkle over it ground alum, and use it on the Ear.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the Ear still swollen after removing the swelling: then you must take out the cast and put it on another cast, which is made with rosewater, until the swelling subsides: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flow increases: then immerse the sponge, or pack the abdomen in cold water, and place above it a bandage: and employ the remaining treatment which separates the blood flow mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Regarding the care of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Altheli which arise in the eyelids, when they are wet and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to press them with pins: or with a single finger, and cut them away from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place above the place a soaked sponge.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And the cauterization is better after the incision
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many of them indeed remain as long as something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, they burn those roots and they do not remain
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Regarding the care of the great eyelid of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the eyelids something which assimilates the Crandini in its height, and its hardness, and because of this it is called great: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore in this is, as you see, if there is a great one proceeding from the eyelid, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every part, and its resolution is easy
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above it a split through the width
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then cleanse the wound from all sides with ease, until it be satisfied.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend the wound with a single suture, and cut it off.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if it is not prepared for cutting, except when you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is large: then gather it together with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause any harm from it.</start_of_turn
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment will restore it and nourish the wound.</start_of_turn
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if it is large and extends downwards towards the inner part of the ear from the surface outwards, then turn the eyelid, and suspend the greatness with a single suture: except that you do not need an incision, and press the wound from all sides.</start_of_turn
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if you lengthen the eyelid by an incision, it will not cause any harm.</start_of_turn
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the greatness with salt water: and care for the place with it which is nourished, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the eyelids.</start_of_turn>
Caput X.	Chapter 10.</start_of_turn>
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a secretion which is generated in the upper eyelid: and it mostly happens in children: and it weighs down the eyes of them, and it causes them to have black spots in the mornings, and they are not able to see the sunlight, because the tears run down to them, and because of this the tears cause their faces to be always wet, and to sleep with their eyes open, and their eyelids are always wet under their eyebrows: and the prominence of the Axirnath is seen in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.</start_of_turn
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	Thus is the manner of his operation, that he place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take the sheet of linen and prepare it in it a basin, and make from it a circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him thereupon, and press with your fingers from every side, so that Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle thereof moisture with some sponge-wool adhering to the tears of the wound for the width, and let not the wound be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin, until Axirnath proceeds from the wound according to the form of a white loaf of bread in many positions
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract therefore the said limb with the cloth which you have filtered between your fingers to the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and be careful, lest you add to the wound, so that you do not reach the eye with the sponge-wool, and damage it
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if indeed Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the wound, you add a little to the wound with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the limb as we have said above
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them upon the place, and bind them with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who smear salt, and place it into the cavity of the wound, so that the remainder of that moisture may be liquefied.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if there happens to be in the place of the after-boil a soft swelling, then care for it with cold compresses until it is healed
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the mode of treating the eye when the eyelids are softened, so that it does not bulge as it should not.
Caput XI.	Concerning the mode of treating the eye when the eyelids are softened, so that it does not bulge as it should not.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs are added beyond the normal course under the natural hairs, and are of an excessive quantity: then they harm the eye, and cause methods of injury, such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and pus, until such time as this becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as is mentioned previously in the chapter on cautery
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by incision and stitching
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannas, as I shall say
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then stretch out the eyelid of the eye with your left hand
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is wrinkled, that is good
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle into the fold where there is a hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs are found: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and tighten the fold.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	And find under the added hairs in the interior part of the eyelid, with the greater lachrymal sac coming down to the lesser lachrymal sac
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton wool or cloth: then mark over the eyelid with cautery, so that it is like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	The wound must be closed, so that it forms a figure according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for it varies in different people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	The wound must be closed so that it forms a figure according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for it varies in different people.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	When the suture has been passed through two lines which you have marked, and you have begun from the larger lachrymal gland up to the smaller, make a single split near the natural hair, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the needle through one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then remove the entire skin.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with the suture the two lips, with needle and fine thread: and stop the bleeding, and cause the excess to adhere to the two eyebrows, with some useful substance, if you wish to do so: or if not, do not cure it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and the thread, three or four days later: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the scab without a suture, and care for it, which will dry and contract
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated with the closing of the wound and the gathering together of its parts: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This is the way of healing which the ancient Ataxmir doctors taught.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Indeed, in this is solicitude over the infirm, and this is from a good operation, and not in this is there any fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is in Ataxmir also: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should form a figure like the figure of the leaf of a myrtle, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to the shape of this which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this shape, with equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then grasp the point where the suture is, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another suture near the greater lacrimal gland, and another suture near the smaller lacrimal gland: and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand with equal elevation: and elevate the skin above which the mark is made of the limb, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, swelling occurs at the incision or the wound: retain this swelling with a compress, and with similar things, from sitting unguents.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids are also swollen, as their hair turns them.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is artificial
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	About care for Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you cover the eyelid, and split the wound which is between the teeth, according to what I have narrated
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two needles, or two slender sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of the pupil: and insert it at the extremities of both from both parts where you have the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather together both things with slightness over that which is superfluous from the eyeball, and string two needles from both parts firmly, and let go of them every few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, when tightly stretched, will die, darken, and decay until it falls apart by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it lingers, then cut it through with scissors.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and do not puncture the hair.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two needles, which you make according to this figure and the quantity in length and width.</start_of_turn

Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this case is as follows: take a fine needle and introduce it under the silk thread, which is fine.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then join the ends together and knot both ends with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be equal to one palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another fine thread pass through the eye of the needle in a short space, and knot the ends of it if you wish.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it be close to the ground so that the operation is evident: because the operation is fine, or even less.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the thread through the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have extracted the natural hair.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair until above the thread: and introduce into the thread the light of the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then grasp your hand with that [same] hand, until the hair emerges with the bristles mingled in the eyelashes with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	Then grasp your hand with that hand, until the hair emerges with the bristles mingled in the eyelashes with the natural hair.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hair and elevate it with that: or cast it away, until it has grown out again, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of the eyelash that happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this eyelash is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, is done from the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and the like of these things
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the way to operate on this is to find that consolidation, and to separate its lips, and to put between them a little piece of linen, and to bind them together, until it heals
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And do not use in the treatment of this anything that will irritate and constrict: for if you do, the eyelash will deteriorate more than before: rather use those things that soften, such as barley-straw: and embroil with water, in which be dissolved salt, poppy seed: and oil of ivy, which is liquefied with some oil: and mix with that the lint, and care for it with that.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your surgical skill is such that you can overcome every difficulty without hindrance, following the initial form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This operation is not complete without some rectification of the Alkhatrati, so that the form may return to its original state.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	The care of the Alkhatrati which is in the lower eyelid is to raise or contract above to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This lower Alkhatrati is what is truly called the Alkhatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural, and is accidental
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	It is caused by a wound, or a split, or a burn, or things like these
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way to perform the operation in this case is to grasp the needle, which has a doubled thread, and pass it through the meat from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the meat
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	And then extend the meat upwards with the needle, and cut the vein with a wide spatula
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the figure of the eyelid returns to its original state, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, grasp the suture, and put it into the split, and close it with the eyelid: and find two holes in the inner side of the eyelid, and the extremities of the two holes are from the two angles of the incision, until they converge and make an angle: until when they converge, the figure of them both becomes like the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	And then remove that part of the meat which is as wide as the acute angle below, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: thus with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said, with soothing medicines, and applications, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the flesh should slip from the wound, from the suture or cautery: then it is necessary to find the wound even under the eyelashes, even as before.</start_of_turn
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with an application, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discourse concerning the care of the Alxatra is, when it is above or below, that it should be treated in that operation, according to the form of the Alxatra.</start_of_turn
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For itself, there are many varieties in the form: and a prudent artist prepares the limb in any way that is possible, until he has restored the figure to its natural shape, or as near as possible, and even the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements.</start_of_turn

When this happens to many people, it is like the consolidation of the upper eyelid with the white of the eye, and it hinders its natural operations.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary therefore to introduce the edge of the radius under the eyelid, and to elevate it upwards: or to extend it with a needle: then cut through the adhesion with a fine scalpel, which is not with the sharpness of the incision of the scalpel, but rather obtusely near: so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that the scalpel be withdrawn easily, and that the eye be restored to its natural shape: and that the adhesion be completely healed.</start_of_turn
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour water into the eye, with water driving out the former: or distill it into it from a vessel made, from gum dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a strip of linen: and put over the eye wool soaked in alum or chalk: and after three days use a sponge, and with solids, until it is healed

Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you grasp it with a finger, it breaks off and does not adhere to it.</start_of_turn
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.

Then take the needle, and introduce it through the hair from the hair of a horse, and silk or thread: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and bind it with thread to the nail, and stretch the nail upwards: and scrape away with the nail the hair following the pupil, as if you were scraping the nail with the hair until the end of it.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then the remainder of the incision is to be made in the root of the lacrimal bone with fine spatulas, or with small forceps: and let go of the natural flesh of the lacrimal bone, so that it does not obstruct the course of the tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with only one nail: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be scraped away with fine spatulas, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And take heed, that you do not touch the delicate corneal tunic, and cause a break in it, and perforate the pupil
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour upon the eye some powdered salt, or make a solution from alum, and leave it in until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	And care for it as is necessary, until it is healed
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is neither sensitive nor able to penetrate the soft parts, nor does it protrude in it, then it is to be treated in this way with the physicians, and will be healed as I have said in the instruction
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and grasp the delicate bone with fine spatulas, of slight curvature, of acute form, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail from above with care
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming rare and crumbling, and leaving prints in the bone, then drain from your hand into the eye from a solution of alum, or of red alum, or of salt: and wash the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation above until the whole of it is removed
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the contrary is present in the eye, leave the swelling alone, and care for the swelling until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Repeat the operation when necessary until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.

Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of men there is a red swelling of the flesh, either composed or superposed, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelids, and sometimes even turns the eyelids outwards: and it looks like a rose petal.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also to put the diseased head in your hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and gather all the flesh with hooks which are convenient for this: and hold it with one forceps, or grasp it.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then make an incision in the first place, until you have finished all of it with the knife.</start_of_turn
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn away from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and let your incision be as we have said in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps, with which the fat is collected, as it is said above.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the incision is complete and the wound has been thoroughly cleansed, then pour salt over the eye: either dissolve it into a powder of red pepper, or use similar unguents which are corrosive to the eye. Place upon the eye a compress of cloth with alum or vinegar, in order to protect it from the heat of the afterburn.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the dressing, and the blood is still warm, and the swelling has subsided: then remove the eye, and keep it cool until the swelling has gone down
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	Do the same with any meat which has been added which has happened in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	It is true that it is necessary to avoid all care of the eye from natural or accidental causes during the operation with the iron, and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you are certain that the limb can tolerate this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of fat from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The fat is a red wax which covers the eye, and hinders its operation by water: and it weakens the eye as long as it lasts.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore in the first place to consider whether the eye in which the fat is, is strong and not in any other way diseased, apart from the fat: then collect the fat from it
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to take great care not to move your head backwards
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend the veins with one thread each, or two according to your prudence: and let the needle be fine like half the diameter, or two threads together according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those one or two [objects], and drain blood every hour until the foreign bodies have been moved from the eye, and they have healed: and beware not to damage the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation lest you cause harm to them [the eyes].
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill in the eye some cold or reddish unguent: that its sharpness may destroy what remains of the foreign body.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then close the eye with this, which will soothe the pain of the eye: and keep it closed for a few days, until the pain has ceased: and protect it from the heat: and repeat the process above until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the forceps.</start_of_turn>

Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the swelling of the nose "Fistula of Arissa," which they cure with cautery or with acute medicine that burns, as the case may be.</start_of_turn
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, do not be ashamed to make an incision at the root of the swelling at its birthplace, and evacuate all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and there is corruption or blackness in it, then dry it with an instrument of this shape.</start_of_turn
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called "Asperation of the head."</start_of_turn
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let iron go from the head downwards, and let its head be rounded like a cushion, which is pierced with a needle of lime or with an awl or with a fine puncture: and place it upon the diseased part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then move it between your fingers, and press your hand firmly, until you know that the fracture has been reduced: and do it again
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with sponges and hemostatic agents.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and a wound has formed there, and the circulation of blood has ceased: and it remains for forty days, and does not return, and does not swell, and does not become inflamed in that place: then you know that it has healed
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then it is not in that limb, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is necessary to detect the bone from the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it has been detected, then grasp the fragment according to this shape, let the iron be at an angle, equilateral: and let the wood be in a triangular extension reaching up to the extremity, like a vein.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be close to the lacrimal: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then move your hand with the fragment, until it pierces the bone, and you feel it is weak: by this you will know that the marrow is coming out through that, when you keep your hand on your nose
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore restore the place with sponges and hemostatic agents, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore a wound has formed and the place has become solid: then the matter which was flowing outwards returns to the nose: and thus it is easier for it to be healed over the wound
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominent eye.
Caput XX.	On the reduction of the prominent eye.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye stands out completely, and does not yield to pressure, neither by reduction nor by diminution: then it is necessary to lance the diseased part: then perform phlebotomy: afterwards apply packs to the cavity without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply to the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and oil, and gum arabic
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye tightly over a pad with many feathers
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the feathers is: that you take fine wool, many, and fold every feather from four sides: make many from these: then put one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then bind over these with a strong cloth
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the packs with suction without incision
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the packs, and keep the eye closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to bind it tightly: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If, therefore, the eye is again reddish from the old tunics, it is good: and if not, then repeat the pad, and feathers, and binding, and packs, until it is healed
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of the incision of the tunica of the eye.
Caput XXI.	Of the incision of the tunica of the eye
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When disruption occurs in the tunica of the eye, then it stands out and projects outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and is deformed in the form of a man by that. Then it is necessary to incumber that: then the operation in this is, as we have said, and it is that you introduce the needle into the root of the tunica from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle through the part of the lacrimal bone where the doubled thread is, and make it penetrate: and draw out the first needle following its own course.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then pierce the place of the doubled thread and ligate with it the edge of the vein around the needle: and tighten it much.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then draw out the needle, and place upon the eye a soaked lanolin on a piece of lint: and draw it out until the thread comes out with the vein.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which soothes it, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the vein is drawn out from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye regains its great prominence.</start_of_turn
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then prick with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and let out the moisture of the albumin, and let the eye descend, and join immediately: then tighten it up until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn>
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati, is not merely an eye-sore, but a disease which is caused by an accumulation of matter in the eye, similar to descending water, and not by the disease itself.</start_of_turn
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method for dealing with it is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly on the bed.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of his head with your hands from both sides, and move it around, until you see the disease rise up towards the lower part of his eye.</start_of_turn
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it will remain fixed and will not descend, and the light will be completely extinguished: and he will see the infirmity just as he saw it: and if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the patient is not prepared for the descent of the bowels as we have said, then sit the patient between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a soft cushion and find it above the bony prominence at the junction of the joint with the cornea in the crown, until the bowels evacuate.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When they have evacuated, then pour lukewarm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have boiled barley and honey: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until the eye is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of the water that descends into the eye, or for a cataract.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have said the kind of water for irrigation, and what is suitable for the perforation according to the declaration and explanation, then take that accordingly for the sake of the patient.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you must make the patient sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the heel: and fix his eye securely, and bind it tightly: then take the outer edge of his eyelid with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye: or take the inner edge with your left hand, if the eye is the right.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with the almond, if the eye is left: or your left hand if the eye is right.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the edge of the almond near the corner of the eye for the width of the radius in the white of the eye apparent to the tear: then push the almond with force: and you will know that the almond has pierced the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the almond has gone through to the bottom.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	The measure of the general path of the eye should reach from the pupil to the end of the iris: this is the circumference of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this very thing in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the [speculum] until it reaches the place where the aqueous humor is
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower eyelid down one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If the water therefore descends immediately, the diseased part will immediately retract from that which opens the pupil, and the speculum in the eye itself
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the water descends again, then withdraw the speculum again, except for the part that is withdrawn by the speculum itself.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it has settled and does not ascend: then withdraw the speculum easily: and you will rotate your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in the water some clear salt of the gem: and wipe with it when you are done
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put over the eye the whole bandage, or soaked wool fattened with saffron, and alum: and bind with it the healthy eye
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are with us at this time, put over it a rough plaster with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If it does not admit the speculum to enter the eye on account of its hardness, because it is from a person whose eye is hard and thick: then it is necessary to take the almond-shaped scraper, which is called the Alberid, which has this form.</start_of_turn>
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Scrape therefore with it only as much as is necessary, and do not move your hand too far back: and do not do anything that may cause injury to the eye.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	Then insert the almond, as we have said. And in order to complete the work of your operation, prepare for the patient a dormitory made in the center: in which he shall sleep upon his back in a dark room: and it shall be guarded from all movements, and from coughing: and let food be given him of that which soothes the nature of his ailment: and let him not move his head to the right or to the left in any way.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligament be adjusted according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then let it be resolved in that dark room, and experience its effect: and make him drink something
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be forced that it be done at the time of the treatment, or immediately after the incision: indeed it should be delayed, because water ascends quickly through the swollen part
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a cold abscess should happen: then it is necessary that you wash the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which settles the abscess: until it is settled: then give him to drink something orally which will regulate his discharge during those few days, while it exists in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he shall gradually go out of the room and return to his home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in this matter the pupil is not excused from his vision for a long time: then indeed he will hear about the operation
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of those from Alayrach are saying that an almond was perforated in the magdan in Alayrach, from which water comes out
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed no one in our land has done this: neither have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that this is something new
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	These are the forms of the species from great things, so that they remain upon them who know them not.

When various meats are born in the nose of a scorpion, there is something which is absorbed from them that causes many feet: from this comes the cancerous tumor, the stone, and the brown scum: from this also is the soft tissue, not brown.</start_of_turn
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in that which is soft from these meats, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, you must sit with your hands opposite to the solid part, open the nose and throw out the mucus into those meats: then draw them out to the exterior and cut away whatever you find with a fine acute knife until you know that all the meat has been removed.</start_of_turn
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of that from whose excision is not possible: then cut it away with a fine instrument until nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood should dominate, or a thick clot form: then oppose it by that which will overcome it: either by malignant clots, then burn them out until the blood is separated, and remove all the meats.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then throw into the nose after the incision of the socket, and water, or liquid.</start_of_turn
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened, and there proceeds from it moisture up to the palate, then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If moisture does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then you know that it is within the living tissue that lies above the roots of the nose bones, which does not emerge with the cutting of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore it is necessary to introduce a thread of linen of some thickness and to knot it in many places: and to place between every knot an amount equal to the breadth of a finger, or less: and the patient will vomit, so that he shoots out one end of the thread through the nose along with the clot, until it reaches the stomach, and comes out through the gut.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many do the same thing as this young boy Attom in school: and it is easy for him who wishes to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two ends of the thread, one that comes out through the nose and the other that remains in the nose
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	And the minister closes the wound with knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is again with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then withdraw the thread: and place in the nose after washing the blood away a little of the unguent that you drank with the Egyptian unguent: do this three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put in the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however urgent is the treatment that requires it, do so.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the application of the caputpurgium, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver, or from air: and let its mouth be like that of a small trumpet, opened like a conch: and its content like that of it.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	If one wishes to make a closed incision, like a needle.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	If one wishes to make a closed incision, like a needle.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	About the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Day 25
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many are born on the tip of the nose of Thelul, and they grow large and increase in size with the days, until the wound becomes equal to their appearance
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary that you cut away that part at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place something over the place, or cauterise, or apply a burning medicine to the place of it
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, the incision tardies, until it has grown large, then consider whether it is a stone, hard, brown in colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous swelling
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many indeed are the waters which cause swelling of the head, and which arise from it with great malice towards the light which they had before.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the swelling is soft to the touch, not brown in colour, and if the incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place with something that dries and contracts, until it heals
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	About the stitching of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	Day 26
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of cohesion is continuous in a soft cartilage, it gives little support in that operation, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything happens to anyone from that, that you consider whether there is a wound remaining with its blood: and then add the pain of the wound with the suture: then care for it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	If the edges of a wound have been separated by continued tension, and every part is sound: then it is necessary to scrub all the parts from their outer surface until they bleed again.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add the lips together with the suture, and tighten them, and sprinkle upon it dragon's blood, and resin: and place above the powder a piece of plaster of Paris, and something else of solid plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and leave it, until the threads are dissolved by themselves.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of suturing is to add tension continuously, or with a hook, as we have narrated in the suture of the belly: or to add tension with the thread, as you have been told.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	About the extraction of the knots of the lips.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from swelling in the insides of their lips, resembling hard grains of herbs: and some of them are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find on every knot of them, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it off from all sides.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then apply to the place after the cutting a little burnt ointment, until the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is bound with vinegar, and the place is cared for with it, in which there is a sticking [agent], until the wound is healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	From the incision of a new wound over the jawbone.
Caput XXVIII.	The head is in the eighth position
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many veins are born over the jawbone, as the ancients call them abuluss
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore to suspend them with a single thread: or to grasp them with forceps, and cut them at their root, and let the blood run, or the serum
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put upon the place the dry sponge, or other powdery astringents, desiccant.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	When the flesh returns to its place after treatment, for many return, then cut the vein again, and cauterize it: for it does not return after being cauterized
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of the tooth with iron
Caput XXIX.	The head is in the ninth position
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they gather on the surfaces of the tooth from the inside and outside parts, and between the gums, the hard, rough coatings, and sometimes they decay, and become yellow, until it reaches that corruption of the gum, and the teeth become loose
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore to make the handle of your hands firm between your hands, and to put your head in your mouth, and to move the molar and the tooth, in which you see the coatings, and something like sand: until something remains from it, and do the same with black pigment, and yellowness, and yellowing, and other things until it moves
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore it is removed from the beginning of the reason, it is good: and if not, then repeat the reason on another day, the second day, and the third day, until you have finally completed the study of that which you desire
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know this, that the tooth requires diverse rasps of different forms, many figures: according to what is prepared for your operation: forasmuch as the rasp which radiates from the lower part is different from the rasp which radiates between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These forms of rasps are prepared for you, which you will need
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	For the extraction of teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all skill, and then to eradicate it
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	There is nothing that can replace its sublimation when it is eradicated: because it is a sublimed substance: until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of the tooth, then it is necessary to command that the sick man eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and be confirmed to you that the tooth is painful
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many indeed deceive the sick with pain, and say that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: but the pain does not depart, until the sick tooth is eradicated
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we know that this is from the operation of bloodletting
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is confirmed to you that the tooth itself is painful, then it is necessary to sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which something useful is to be found, until the gums are separated from all parts: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have crushed it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in that place well, and hold the patient's head between your knees: which you have held well, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it under it from all parts with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corrupted: then it is necessary that you fill up that hole with wool: and bind it with the extremity of a thin thread, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you take care of the surrounding gum from all parts much with scraping during the process of extraction.</start_of_turn>
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your courage, so that you do not break it, and remain over it until that evil has gone from it which is greater than its first pain.</start_of_turn>
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Beware, lest you do the things which the phlebotomists do carelessly in their haste, and your audacity over the eradication of it, beyond what we have said.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many men have made great mistakes through their pride over people's great diseases, from which it is difficult to recover, and that remain whole, or extract some of them, or extract the whole thing with some of the teeth of the jaw: as we have often seen.</start_of_turn
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is collected after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flows from the place (for many men it happens): then there is something of the clot there, and fill it with that: and if not, cauterize it if it does not bring you the clot.</start_of_turn
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the fine forceps which you must use to move the tooth in the first place: let their long extremities be broad, and their short handles be thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is put upon them with the hand: let them be like the jaws of large beavers, until when you bind them with the thread, they do not break themselves, neither bend: their short extremities must be strong and made of iron, or of twisted wire, directed towards the extremities: and in their extremities must be teeth, some of which are mixed with others, and bind the constriction gently, firmly.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when extremities resemble the shape of an eagle's beak, which is called ciconia, and are subject to strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter I
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains in the eradication of a tooth which has fractured something, it is necessary to place butter on the area for one or two days until the place is softened: then introduce forceps into the cavity, or graspers: whose extremities resemble the beak of an eagle, which is called ciconia
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file or like an awl
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If these forceps do not suffice to extract the tooth, then it is necessary to make an incision over the root and remove the entire pulp, and introduce a small forceps, which is called Palanca parua, whose shape is as follows:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Its short handle and large head: and it is not to be grasped, lest it be broken
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through this, that is good: and if not, it is necessary to use other instruments whose form is similar to these
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first triangular shape of the extremities, in which there is some thickness
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The fine triangular shape of the extremities
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument which has two branches, whose shape is as follows
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which are appropriate for teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also necessary to grasp with this instrument which resembles a large single unit, of this triangular shape of the twisted extremities, which has some thickness, so that it does not break: and it must not be grasped
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	Know that the instruments of the teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments, they do not all work in the same way. And a prudent craftsman, skilled in his art, finds for himself the appropriate instrument according to the operation and the ailments of each.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For the ailments of which the ancients did not speak, there are instruments appropriate to each.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the jawbone is fractured from the tooth, or from any other bones of the mouth, or if it is putrefying: then one must look closely into the place itself with the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and handle with care, as its form is like this
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	It is there in some degree of length, so that it may be tied up or held with the bone, and not flee and break, until the bone is extracted: and restore the place with the physicians who are accustomed to this
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is only a small amount of pus in the bone, then drain it from its pus, and care for it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	As for the elevation of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 2.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth are prominent not according to their natural course, a wound is made by that shape: and especially when this happens in women and girls, because of their gums.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	One must therefore consider this
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	Because if a tooth has grown after another tooth, and is not located, or if it is possible to suture it, or to smooth it: then extract it: and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small knife, made of iron, with acute extremities blunt.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such as that which you make on many days, on account of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not cause damage to any other tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the exposed edge of the limature is prominent: then limate it with the same limate which has the form of this
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole edge of the limature be grasped by the lesser points of the handle, like a limate which is made for a needle: with which the tooth is slowly pared away in many days with ease, without causing damage to the tooth, and falling out: then soften it, finally smooth it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth from which a part has broken away, and which hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to limate it also, until the asperity of that fracture has been removed, and it has been made even: and it must be flattened, so as not to hurt the tongue, or corrupt the speech
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the restoration of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens that the front teeth are cracked and bruised by percussion, or in any case: and the diseased cannot be held in place by the bite of the food which he habitually swallows: and when treatment with medicaments has no effect: then the wit is in this, that they be bound with gold wire: for gold is white, and does not putrefy after a few days: but silver never changes
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle wire be in thickness and breadth as much as it can grasp between the teeth
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the restoration is that you grasp the wire, and pass the loop through between two healthy teeth: then you twist the two extremities of the wire between the teeth which are moving, whether one or more, until you have reached the healthy tooth of the other side
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Repeat the process until you reach the part from which you commenced: and grasp your hand with care and wisdom until it does not move forward: and let your constriction be such as to bind the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Repeat the process until you reach the part from which you commenced: and grasp your hand with care and wisdom until it does not move forward: and let your constriction be such as to bind the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is dissolved or fractured, string it with another thread and stabilize it as before for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth and two moved teeth, as with water
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one tooth or two have fallen out from their places due to an injury, they must be returned as we have described, and they remain: and this does not happen except by a skillful, prudent, and experienced artificer
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some piece of bone or cartilage has been adjusted: and it is made like a tooth in shape, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth has been extracted and is bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament under the tongue occurs naturally, as it does in the birth of a human being, or accidentally due to an injury which has consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this is that you open the mouth of the sick person in his cheek, and elevate his tongue: then cut through that nervous ligament along its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything hard or knotty in that area, and it comes from the consolidation of the wound: then project into that tissue and find it by its breadth, until you cut the ligament, and the knot will be resolved.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Take heed, that there be no fracture in the depth of the flesh, and cut the artery there, and the flow of blood will increase.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it is to be bound in a wet bandage with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a cloth of linen, which shall hold the patient throughout the night: so that it does not consolidate in the second place
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, the flow of blood increases, then put over the place a soaked compress of alum.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood boils, then cauterize the place with a blunt cautery, which agrees with that: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Whenever there occurs under the tongue a swelling which assimilates the small ranula, hindering the tongue from its natural operation: and perchance it increases so much, that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in this is, that you open the mouth of the patient before the sun: and consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see the same dark, hard swelling which does not have any sensation in the infirm: then do not touch it, because it is cancer
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is humidity: then project into that tissue and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows upon thee in the hour of thy operation, then lay upon it a dry sponge, until the blood be separated: then return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply vinegar and salt: and care for the rest with such treatment as is suitable for this, until it be healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of the wound of two almonds.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When they happen between the guttur godad, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which happen outside: and they are called two almonds: which when you cure with that which we said in the discourse, and they do not heal, then consider it
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard wound, of a dusky colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it go, until it is healed
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either perforate it: or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is slight: then you must cut it off
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this is as you consider before your operation, if the wound has calmed down completely, or if it has diminished somewhat: then do sit the patient with his head towards the sun: and open the mouth, and take out the tongue with your hands, and grasp the lower lip with an instrument, which has such a form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Do it from silver, or from air, which is subtle like a knife
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore the language is spoken, and the apostema is shown, and the latter falls upon the former: then take the hook and grasp it in the belly, and draw it out as much as is possible, except that you draw out with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut the wound with the instrument whose form follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	Like scissors: truly the extremities of these are curved, so that the opening of each is directed towards the other at an acute angle: from which care must be taken lest there be iron or blood soaked into the wound.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut with the sponge, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be acute from one side, not from the other side.</start_of_turn>
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut the belly once, cut the other following the same kind of incision.</start_of_turn>
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision the patient shall gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however blood flows from it, gargle with water in which are pounded coriander seeds: or leaves of myrtle, or things like these from the sponges, until the bleeding stops: then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there appear in the belly other apostemata, besides the two in the tonsils.</start_of_turn
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut these therefore equally according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have treated a woman with an apostemate which was born between her ribs, which was drawing towards the loin, little sense, because it was almost strangling her: and the woman was breathing from meatus strictus, and I forbade her from eating and drinking: and she died within one or two days.</start_of_turn
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The after-tooth shall ascend only as much as it emitted two branches, until it reaches above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	The after-tooth shall ascend only as much as it emitted two branches, until it reaches above the two nostrils.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then draw it [the after-tooth] out, and from that there is a large piece [of tissue].
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut off what is beyond the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then make that which projects from the other nostril retreat inwards
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then open its mouth, and press its tongue: and afterwards fix the tooth in the after-tooth: then cut off from it a part of it, and there will be no blood there: it is absolutely like the gut of a woman, and immediately drinks water, and then eats food
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	It is not right to continue cutting into that after-tooth for a long time: and the after-tooth will remain in the place where we cut, until it is prolonged excessively and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised, and cauterized the after-tooth between the gut.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood from the addition [of the after-tooth]: then I went away from that side, and I do not know what God did with it after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a toothless after-tooth
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrus descends to the lower jaw, and the after-tooth is long: then it is called a perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a toothless
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with that which we said in the explanation, and the cure does not confer: and you see that the after-tooth is soft and quiet from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is aggregated in a round shape, which has no length, is either blood, or of a dusky or black colour, and has no sensation: in such a case it is necessary to make an incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And in such a case there is fear over the sick person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you are treating it according to the method which I have mentioned from the white colour and the length, so that you make the sick man sit facing the sun: and you grasp his tongue with an instrument of which I have spoken previously: then fix the thumb of your hand in one, and draw out the other: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned in the incision of two caruncles
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except that which adds to the natural limit without addition
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will damage the flesh and the bone.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision make use of what we have mentioned in the incision of two caruncles: and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the sick man returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and haste.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization in this is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your lap
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	And then grasp his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned before.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	And then take from the water which I mentioned before, and mix it with burnt charcoal which has not been extinguished, and put it on it not thick, neither thin, and press from it the concavity of this instrument
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	So that the extremities of it on which the medicine is placed are like the concavity of the radius of a conch shell
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with the medicine above the vulva: and the patient lies with his side open, so that the fluid may flow out from his mouth from the medicine inwards, so that it does not descend into his gut, and it causes him pain.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first keep your hand above the vulva for the quantity of half an hour, until you see it is becoming dark, and give the patient a sedative dose of the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take the limb, and fold it over the end of the radius, and fold the limb with the medicine inside, and bring the radius with the limb into the cannula above, until the limb is fixed over the vulva.</start_of_turn
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you follow that which you wish concerning the cautery of the vein.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then remove the medicine: for it itself will dry and fall off in three days, or four.</start_of_turn
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If however you think that you must go again with the medicine, go again: and after the cautery, remove the surrounding fat of the vein with the limb and soak it in butter, and massage it with that which is around it from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.</start_of_turn
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And care for the outside with stitches, and for the inside with gargling, until he is healed.</start_of_turn
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is this sort of treatment safer than an incision and longer lasting in respect of fear.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the vulva is healed even with that which is subtler than cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.</start_of_turn
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, hyssop, origanum, rue, sassafras, chamomile, abrotanum, and similar herbs: gather them all together, or some of them in a vessel, and immerse them in vinegar. Let them boil: and the vessel should be covered with a layer of earth in the center. There should be a hole in the middle of the vessel above which the instrument is composed in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it of silver, or of brass: and insert the extremity, in which is the pomegranate seed, into the bone of the patient, until the vapor reaches the upper lip above the cannula, until the lip is darkened very much
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of apostematis.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Praiseworthy are you for adding this in apostemate: and it is not proper to do this except when the apostematis is cool
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument is not present with you, then take a needle and compose in its extremity bark or resin: so that it does not burn the bone of the patient: because the bark or resin of the resin prohibits the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with health
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	About the extraction of thorns, and bones from the gullet.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times there adheres in the gullet bones, or thorns of fish, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore that you extract what is apparent from it which falls from the tongue with the instrument at the angle of the jaw, and it is declared to you that it is in the gullet
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the gullet, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps then the adjacent thing will depart through neglect.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick man may swallow down a piece of bread, or a radix of lettuce, or swallow down a dry lump of barley: or he may take a dry sponge of sea-foam and bind it up with a thread, and then swallow it down.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it has reached the place where the bones or spines are, and is drawn out, then it departs.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not depart with it as we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius of a bean, and at its extremity there shall be a curve which will enter the gut without difficulty: and let it have its head elevated upwards
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And take care of its touch upon the epiglottis, so that it does not cause it to cough, and drive it down with the bone or the spine, or let the physician drive it in with his hand
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the sick man may drive it down himself is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he drives it downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of which is according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it departs
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of blood clots.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the blood clot is treated with that which I have said in the previous section for the treatment of wounds with the physicians, and it does not yield, then consider in the belly of the sick man under the sole or at the base of the tongue, after having drawn out the tongue with the instrument which I have mentioned.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your hand should slip over the blood clot, draw it out with a small hook, or with fine fingers that are withdrawn from the middle.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with the fingers: then take a curved cannula and introduce it into the belly of the patient up to the guttur: then introduce into the curve of the cannula a burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from all water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then take a full treatment of cold water, and open his mouth with it: and close his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and drink water an hour after each meal with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The bloodsucker is like him who feels the water falling from his hand.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not go away with that which we have told you, then fumigate the patient with aromatic herbs, or with an asa with an instrument which we mentioned in the fumigation of the wounds
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it itself goes away
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in fumigation is that you take all the vessels in which there are dates with fire: and the vessels are covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and make in that hole the extremity of the instrument
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation, and put the patient's mouth on the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth, until you know that the fumigation has passed to the bloodsucker
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the bloodsucker immediately goes away.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not go away, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient can tolerate sitting, and eat garlic and onions, and does not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he goes away with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	This is the form of the instrument with which bloodsucker is extracted from the gut, when it falls upon its belly.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like forceps, thus like a wound: for it has the curvature which intrudes into the gut
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the beak of a stork, which is called ciconia, in which there is the roughness of lime: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	About the opening of the apostemata, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.</start_of_turn>
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of apostemata, of many kinds, according as the recollection of their matter: and they are diverse in their perforation and their section into two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is a kind of apostematum which comprehends humilities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other is because of the place where it occurs in the body
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For indeed the apostemata that occur in the head are different from those that occur in the belly: and those that occur in a fleshy place are different from those that occur in the joints: and each one of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	There are also apostemata which do not need to be perforated except after the perfection of health in the body, and the completion of their matter: and there are those which must be perforated while they are raw and have not matured according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as apostemata which are close to the joints
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an apostematum occurs near a joint and persists, it may putrefy because of the surrounding parts, perhaps corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint: which is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	The swelling is at the main limb: for if you delay the perforation of it until it ripens, then it will bite you or become infected, or through that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	The swelling is close to the limb, perforate it therefore while it is still immature: and it must not be perforated as a raw swelling, without complete digestion, except that it is close to the limb, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the inner parts, and make a fistula, or remain in its termination without healing.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the swelling, for it is matured according to the completion of its complement: and it is at rest in soothing of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulse, and elevation of the head of the swelling: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the perforation in the lower part of the swelling, and more elevated: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the swelling is in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places that do not have a reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those things which reflect, be cautious with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the swelling is in the places of carbuncles: then it is better that you delay the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the poison is prolonged, and there is much dirt and pus, and perhaps the lips of the wound will be inflamed, and its depth will be increased
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some swellings are perforated according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to that which the limb requires
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary to perform a small perforation in the small apostemata and a large perforation in the large apostemata: or multiple sections according to the size of the apostemata.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	Some apostemata require the skin to be sutured: when it is made like a piece of cloth and is completed at the end, when it is dead. This is like what happens in many cases, such as with wounds from a dog bite and abscesses
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	There are also those which are sectioned with three angles
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	Like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the heel apostemata.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	There are also those which are sectioned in a circular shape and those which are sectioned like a half moon: and those which are similar to these sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	This is true of those which do not have a head, such as the superficial leninous apostemata: it is necessary to perforate them with a superficial perforation, or only planely.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the apostema is large, and when many stitches have been gathered together, and it is perforated, so that the pus does not spill out immediately: extract a part of it from that very moment
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then anoint the apostema until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree of the case: especially if the patient is weak in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved with the discharge of the pus: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not know it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take great care with this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the perforation, concerning which perforation you have made the after-effects, it is necessary that you should drain the blood: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a little blood after the perforation, or if it is a flat section, then administer a ligature from linen, or from an old coat
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is great bleeding and many holes of perforation, then it is necessary that you should introduce a ligature into every hole until they reach the belly.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have cut off a part of the skin in the after-effect, or if you have circumcised the area: then it is necessary that you should put on an old coat, or as when a garment is being taken off, or be covered with wool without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and take care of it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, bleeding occurs during your operation in an hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which soak it in a cloth: and put it over the site of bleeding many times over
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you should administer regimen and care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in the winter and the site of the after-effect is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you should infuse sponges with wine and oil of warmth: and put them on the place.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer and the place is fleshy: then it is necessary that you should put on sponges soaked in water, or oil, or both with wine and oil, and keep it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must dissolve the after-effect, and drain it, and administer care which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is indeed necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of wounds in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the nature of the wound, indeed I have spoken of every wound in general, how it is necessary for its treatment to be considered individually
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the section of wounds that occur in the head skin.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small wounds occur on the head skin, and they are of the kind of nodules which contain tunics, which are like small bags: as if they were chicken eggs
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	There are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	There are those which are fat: and those which contain moisture like slime: and those which contain moisture like wet earth and gravel: and similar to these, and those which are hard stones
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their section no artery is injured.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is to learn how to use the instrument which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it with the superficial section: in this way.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	Begin with the incision from line b to line g. When the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the sac which contains it, do not leave anything behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times it returns, if anything remains of it
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then soak the wound in Egyptian unguent if it is there: or in water and salt: and apply with it a willow, and remove it on another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The wound has eaten away what remains of the bladder.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Repeat the procedure above on the wound with the second and third aegyptio, and if you still do not see that anything remains of the bladder, then indeed take care of the wound with unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the wound still contains a pimple: then dry it out in this way, making a cut having the shape of a cross: and remove the nails between the two layers of the cut, and scrape the wound from all sides: and try your skill in extracting the membrane which contains it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it makes resistance, the artery must be dealt with as I shall tell you later.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	Proceed in the same way with a stone abscess, by cutting it open and treating it in the same way as before.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	The cutting open of a stone abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these bladder abscesses which are in the head of some men, in whom there is no moisture at all.</start_of_turn
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I have cut open a bladder abscess in the head of a woman who was old, and I found the abscess to be like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it burst open.</start_of_turn
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses of the head, however, except for those which happen in the heads of young children and near the roots of the ears, the incision should be made on the surface.</start_of_turn
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an opening at the lower part of it, so that the course of the healing may be downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for that which agrees with this from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Then care for that which agrees with this from the treatment of the tonsils in the neck
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many swellings occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over these which occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one: and every tonsil is within its own sheath, as in the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have mentioned
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these tonsils are many
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these there are fatty ones: and those which contain humors: and malignant ones, which do not obey treatment
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In this way, as the good humors are expelled from the touch, whose mark is the proximity of the color of the skin, and which move towards all parts, and are not connected with the nerves of the neck, neither with the windpipe, neither with the arteries, neither is it deep: it is necessary to cut it off with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line b to the line g. and to remove two lips of the skin with one stitch, or with many stitches if necessary, as we have mentioned in the swelling of the head, and to extract it gradually
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is necessary to be cautious so that no bone, or nerve, is injured
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the sponge be neither too acute nor too blunt: so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or cause discomfort to the patient, and cuts only what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein or an artery, or are hindered by the operation, then put in the wound a bit of alum or some powders which absorb blood, and bind up the wound, and leave it until the swelling subsides, and the wound is softened: or begin to putrefy it
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Blood is severed by the clamp Redi until completion of the operation.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger whether anything remains from the other small trophlets: if so, cut easily and wash it away.</start_of_turn>
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If anything is in the groin of the large trophlet: then it is necessary that you do not cut that trophlet from its root: rather it is necessary that you bind it with a doubled strong thread and let it go down naturally without stitching.</start_of_turn>
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then put a sponge soaked in Egyptian unguent under the wound.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum.	Take care of yourself.</start_of_turn>
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole trophlet is cut, then it is necessary that you join together the two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately, after which you should wash because there is no remaining excess.</start_of_turn
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you wash and there remains some excess because of the size of the trophlet, then it is necessary that you insert your finger under the root of it and extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever contains moisture from the trophlets, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that you can see the place of its maturity: and put the perforation from this which follows below the body as we have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lint with unguent, and the like, so that it may consume whatever remains from the corruption: until when you wash the wound will be clean: then take care of yourself with the generation of meat, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Of the excision of the epiglottis from the apostemate within the gut.</start_of_turn
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients say that this part of the epiglottis was made by none other in our land, and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in cases of swelling of the joints, it is necessary to make an incision of the epiglottis: since it will not receive any benefit from it, because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	And in those who have a soft swelling in the mouth, or the gullet, or two glands of the tongue, when there is no inflammation of the windpipe, it is necessary to make an incision of the epiglottis in order to escape from the destruction which is caused by the accumulation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, to cut under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision in the middle of the two circles, as in the case of the epiglottis of a hare: for this place is suitable for the incision, because it is bare of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	And if the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with one finger.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until it reaches the windpipe: there will be blood in the wound.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the soft tissue which we have mentioned: and it is signified above the incision of the windpipe by the phlegm which comes out of it, when it is ruptured, and the cutting of the vocal cords.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And withdraw the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When an hour has passed since the inflammation has subsided, gather together two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew them up alone without cartilage
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines which make the flesh grow, until healing is accomplished.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis writes: Then administer the medicines which make the flesh grow, until healing is accomplished.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Thus we have learned from this discourse that the exposition is not to be delayed, except when the patient has fainted from pain: for the patient has perished while breathing, and wishes to interrupt his breathing: the epiglottis is split, that the patient may breathe through the wound in the throat, and he recovers from death. Therefore they command that the wound be closed, until the harmful cause of the disease has passed away. And the harmful cause of the disease is in most cases three days, and almost like the disease itself: therefore they command that the wound be closed again when the disease has passed away, and that it be cared for until healing has taken place.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that is what I myself have seen: a handmaid took a knife and put it into her own throat, and it went into the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to care for her, and I found her foaming at the mouth, like one who is dead.</start_of_turn>
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw that the wound had burst open, and blood had flowed out of the wound of the handmaid.</start_of_turn
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was amazed, for she did not bleed to death, nor did she guide the blood: the wind was coming out of the wound.</start_of_turn
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I cared for her, and I closed the wound, and cared for her until she was healed: and nothing happened to the handmaid except that she coughed up blood: and she recovered after a few days to a better condition.</start_of_turn>
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Hence it is clear: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
Caput XLIIII.	On the section of the hernia of the gutturis.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This chapter is entitled 'On the section of the hernia of the gutturis', and is a large apostema according to the colour of the body: and it is frequent in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	It is classified into two kinds: either it is natural or accidental
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	The natural hernia is certainly not caused by an injury
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental hernia is, however, classified into two kinds: one is like a swelling of fat nodules
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other is like an apostema which arises from the swelling of an artery
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is danger: it must not be presumed that it is small just because of its appearance: and you must prove it and investigate it with an instrument called the Intromisso.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find that it is like a swelling of fat nodules and is not suspended with any other parts: then you must dry it out, just as you would dry out fat nodules: and extract it with that which contains the contents of the sac, if there is one: or if not, then examine the whole of it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place from which it was extracted until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	'On the section of the super-species of nodules'.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLV.	'On the section of the super-species of nodules'.</start_of_turn
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already mentioned all of them in their division: and it is necessary to narrate here the difference between the Node and the Exitus, in case of doubt.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that when the Exitus is hot, and there is fever and pain which arise: until the ebullition of excess has passed and the putrefaction is completed: then the fever and heat will subside.</start_of_turn
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node is not hot, neither feverish, nor painful, it contains blood clots, which is their own sac, and is according to the colour of the body: and it begins like millet and becomes like barley, being greater or less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	There are two kinds: either fatty [blood clots] or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colour of moisture is various, as I said in the previous section
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary, therefore, when you are dealing with the treatment of the Node, to examine it and inquire about it at first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to the shape which will be shown in the subsequent chapter
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	The way of inquiring about the abscesses, and of all Nodes, is to take hold of this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the abscess: and withdraw your fingers gradually until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then you will take the last part of your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out through its opening.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If indeed blood runs out, whatever its colour: then dry it with a superficial incision, as I said in the other abscesses
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no blood runs out through the opening of the Intromissum, then you know that it is fatty: dry it therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, as we have learned: and suspend it with stitches, and scrape away the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the clot close to it, until you have extracted it whole with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the clot ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, as often happens in this case, then extract it piecemeal until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	If anything remains from it, a little or a lot, it returns to Node according to its majority.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If anything remains from it, a little or a lot, it returns to Node according to its majority.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large Node, then two of its lips must be sutured, and it must be cared for with that which is contained in it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein, then it must be sutured, and its place must be properly cleansed, and it must be bound tightly for two or three days, until the vein has putrefied and the blood-clotting has ceased: then return to the incision which remains from the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Of the instruments outside which are used for cutting and perforating.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of the instruments which are introduced, and there are three kinds of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	There are three kinds of these instruments: the large, the medium, and the small
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be of iron, rounded at the ends and flattened in the middle, so that they may hasten the entrance into the abscess
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the perforators, and no, that is, for piercing: and one of them is called the beris, which is a piercer, and there are three kinds of them
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	There are three kinds of these: the large, the medium, and the small
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They meet, so that they may investigate through these abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and bubbles from that which is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, third, linear, like a large needle which follows under the skin, from citrine, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those which are made from citrine.</start_of_turn>
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Experiences also arise from black lead, which unite so that through them fistulas are formed, the cavities of which reflect like lenities themselves with those reflections.</start_of_turn>
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three kinds again.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of the size of the fistula and the tightness of it.</start_of_turn
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of veins, and there are many kinds.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For some are simple, that is, those which have only one curve: and there are three kinds like rivers, great, medium, and small.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And blind veins are three kinds.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And those which have two curves are called haemae: there are three kinds of them: and those which have three curves are called quinary: and all of these are necessary in their place.</start_of_turn
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes and abscesses: there are three kinds of them, for some are large, medium, and small.</start_of_turn
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which make the cut are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not put together except when there is an attempt to make an incision in the tissue of a node near the fear of a vein, or nerve: and so that the patient may recover more quickly from the pain caused by the incision than from the pain caused by the excision of the abscess.</start_of_turn
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magda, and there are three kinds of them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	These are Magda, and there are three kinds of them. They are made of air, and are similar to Radium, with which alcohol is made: and at the wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in it runs inwards and outwards whenever desired, like water.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of Spatumila which go between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: and they are not perceived by the sick: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The winds of the veins when the blood flow is broken: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of air, or lemon-yellow, round, to the length of a palm, like water: and are subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of veins should be large and small with you: in order to break the blood easily when necessary, and then when there is no physician present
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But do not use these in the breaking of blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar wounds, from carnation, humors.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made of these small things which are similar to the knobs of fists, according to their shape: with which the blood is broken when it flows out of the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and when they are made of these things which are round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	About the care of the breasts of men which assimilate the milk of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some people swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to emit urine in sleep), they become like those of women: and they remain soft after urination.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this must cut across the breasts with a lunar section according to this shape from the ridge, to the ridge, and then scrape off the whole fatness.</start_of_turn>
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then apply alum from the medicine of incision.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together the two lips of the wound with stitches, and take care of it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast hangs downwards and becomes soft because of its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to make two similar lunar sections on the two upper sides of it, each containing the other at the limits of each, until one line is greater than the other. According to this shape, from the ridge to the ridge. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two lips and remove the fat, and do what has been said concerning the stitches and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however one does not wish to perform the incision because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding: then it is necessary to apply a poultice soaked in corrosive unguent under the breast and let it go, until that which remains of the fat has been eaten away.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of the apostemas, which happens under the nipple.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemas which happen under the nipple are of the kind of hard roundworms which contain vesicles, and from these are the humilities which proceed.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Whatever is contained in the humors which are exuded by the moon must be cut away with a lunar section, according to this form, from the line b to the line g, as when all that is in the apostemate from the uterus is evacuated, then immediately fill up the cavity with wool and dismiss it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	The cavity must be filled with wool and dismissed until the next day.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the uterus were of the kind of cluster of knots of Strophulas, then cut above it, as we have said in the section above the Strophulas equally
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, a vein extends in this place and emits pus, then administer cautery in it, as we have said above in what precedes
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the section of the uterus which happens because of the artery and the vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.</start_of_turn>
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above the womb is consolidated, then much blood flows out from the uterus: and in the same way blood flows out from the veins also, as in it from the uterus and swelling
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the uterus and swelling are because of the artery and the vein, are these: for when the uterus is because of the artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you press on the swelling with your fingers, you feel as though there is a crackling sound in it
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of the vein, is round in the belly of the patient
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this uterus is dangerous, especially under the ribs, and in the groin, and the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is very harmful
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that the care of it should be taken with iron, and that which is also in the extremities or in the head, must also be taken care of.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	For indeed that which is from iron is from the swelling of the artery, which is found in the cut section along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, afterwards the artery: and liberate it from the tunics, until it is detached
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce under these the point, and make the vessel penetrate until the other side, and bind the artery with a double thread in two places, as you have been taught in the extraction of two arteries which are in the intervals
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then cauterize the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until the blood which is in it all has gone out, and the clot is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall away: afterwards care for this with suitable unguents until it heals
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	For if there should be a clot on account of the section of the Vein, then you must be careful not to do any damage to the skin with your hand.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce under the place where you held your hand the point, and make the vessel penetrate: and there be in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with the same the clot with a good ligature: according to what I have told you concerning the ligation of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another point with another thread under the whole clot at the incision of the needle: before that, and bind your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the swelling in the middle of its course, until when it departs what is in it: then cut through the excess of the skin, and discharge what is bound up from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then apply above the swelling the piece which you submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment, which is done with liniments and unguents, until it is healed
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	As for a swelling that comes from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head L
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as it happens with a swelling in an artery and a vein, in the same way it happens with nerves: that which happens by percussion in the body, or by excessive labor, and in a similar way: and it is most frequent in the armpits, or the calves, and in all the places where the nerves are joined together: and it is a serious swelling
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it is found in various positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with pressure, it feels in it a weakness similar to that of stupidity
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a swelling that is gathered in the depth of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not go forward or backward or to the rear
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Since it comes from the body in the joints, it does not need to be sutured with iron
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps there will be a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which comes from the body in the head, or in the front, find the skin with a swelling like a bubble
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from its root
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and scrape it off: then take it out, and gather up the blood with a suture: and care for it until it heals
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the excision of the apostematus, which occurs in the groin.
Caput LI.	Concerning the excision of the apostematus, which occurs in the groin.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Certain people suffer from multiple tumors in the groin, and in other parts of their bodies, such as the testicles, which are called Fungalia because of their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is tough, their head is large, and they are covered with skin.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	They are excised from small incisions, and they grow large in size.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	I myself saw a man who had two of these tumors in his groin, which were larger than any others. There was no difference between them in color, size of root, or in their covering, and they bled profusely from their bases.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I advise you to excise them, and you will find in one about X and eight ounces, and in the other about six ounces. The operation for their excision is as follows: if the patient is bleeding excessively, and the color of the tumor is white, bloody, and tough of root: then excise it with a broad knife, and be present with cautery in the fire
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Much blood is expelled from their excision. Therefore, if you are overcome with blood, cauterize them immediately
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient is weak and timid from the incision with the knife, take a lead weight and make a hook from it, and string it with thread: whose manner is as we have said, and dismiss it in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead tightly.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease stringing the lead until it is fractured, and falls away without labor
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the root of the great vessel should be affected, then in its incision there is something fearful and small: especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is true that it is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then burn it, so that it does not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound has healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not presume to cut through the little one which is of a dusky colour, little sense, and foul aspect: for it is a cancerous tumor. And I shall come back with a reminder of cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Regarding the care of the umbilical cord.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The umbilical cord becomes prominent from many wounds
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Either from cuts on the skin which are above the belly: or it comes out through an opening in the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the clotted blood in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is because of a cut in the skin, and the opening of the bowels: then its colour is similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various places
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the discharge of the intestines, then its place is as we have mentioned, with an opening of various sizes
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and it causes great pain
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to humidity, it is soft, then it does not conceal itself when you touch it, neither does it tighten nor add anything.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then at that time the swelling appears with these signs against the black mark of the nail
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is due to a broken bone: then it is a swelling that is grave, large, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to a wound, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in this case is as you consider, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of an artery or vein or a wound: then it is necessary to prohibit the treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in this case there is fear and danger, as you were taught in the chapter where I said that swelling due to an artery or vein is dangerous
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the navel is due to an intestine or a tumor: then it is necessary to expel the patient, as long as he holds his breath, and to keep him standing extended
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then the signs with encasement all around the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down between your hands over his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a bandage slightly wider in the circumference of the navel over the place where you indicated encasement
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the swelling upwards with a large loop.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it firmly around with thread or silk thread: and make the knot of the ligament well bound.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the swelling extended above the ligament
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that the finger is caught by the ligament: then draw out the splinter of bone which is projecting inwards, and introduce it into the finger-index, and press the intestine inwards: and if you find a bone, then grasp it with a single hand, and break off its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, on the other hand, the artery or vein is affected: then surround it with much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your work./li>
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And grasp two needles, and introduce them through two strong threads: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the swelling in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it off when it softens and putrefies.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound as it should be until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	Which if the navel-mark is raised from the flesh near it, or from moisture: then it is necessary that you make the swelling concave, as we said.</start_of_turn
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And remove the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for the wound as it solidifies the place.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura CANCRI.	§ Care of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said concerning the species of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution must be taken with it when treated with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and must be cautiously treated.</start_of_turn
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said, when Cancer is in a place where its extirpation is possible, as in the breast or the thigh, or in like members, from parts which can be excised entire: especially when it is in its beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is great and advanced, it is not proper to approach it directly
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I am unable to cure anyone from this: neither do I know anyone who can do so before me
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in this case, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed as before, and to evacuate the morbid tumor from the black bile several times
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then let us perform a phlebotomy if you find it with the swelling fully developed.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which he is placed alongside the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then join the Cancer to the nails which are convenient to him
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then bind it around with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off suddenly, but press the place and evacuate all the thick blood, as much as you can with the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, it causes a violent flow of thick blood from an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the remaining treatment until he is healed
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ On the treatment of dropsy
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 14
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall discourse in this section concerning the different kinds of dropsy, and how water is accumulated: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment by physicians.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is not except one kind of ascites alone: neither is it like iron in kind of tympani: neither like kind of hypospasmus complete: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are being treated for this kind of hydrops of the tympani, take heed and do not neglect your treatment: consider it carefully.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if a patient is suffering from weakness alongside the hydrops, or any other illness besides the hydrops, such as vomiting or solution of the bowels, and the like: then do not treat him with iron, for that is dangerous
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the patient overflowing with spirit, neither young nor old: then the mode of treatment in this case is that you support the patient with your hands and press down upon his belly with your thumbs, driving out the water downwards.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	And take a sponge of thorns, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	There are two acute ends, long, like a sponge of thorns.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Indeed, there is some slight shortness in this, so that it does not pass through until the intestines, and does not wound it
Deinde considera.	Consider carefully.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of the hydrops is from the intestines, then it is necessary to cut from the navel to the quantity of three fingers, downwards straight over the belly
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of the hydrops is because of the congestion of the liver: then your incision will be on the left side from the navel to three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the cause of it is the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side: and it is not necessary to make the incision above where you want to put the patient, in order not to cause excessive bleeding to the delicate parts
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate with the instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that area, and raise your hand with Spatumili between the skin, and scrape, as though you are scraping yourself: and be equal in the quantity that you scrape as the quantity of nails, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate the scrape, until Spatumili reaches the empty place: and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw it out, and introduce into the hole of the instrument, which has this shape
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or gold, or electrum, flexible, soft: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as water: at its extremity is an arm.</start_of_turn>
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends above the instrument, so that it evacuates from the water in an hour the quantity medium.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick person dies from the resolution of the spirit of his animal: or it happens to him syncope which approaches death.</start_of_turn
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what is significant to you the conditions of the sick person from the virtue of his pulse, and from his health.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then draw out the instrument, and retain the water.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it is retained immediately by the skin which retains the hole which is above the scrape: of which I told you, that you must perforate it according to the light mode.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Repeat the instrument on the other side if you are able to tolerate the patient: and extract also from water the quantity that is sufficient.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Repeat the procedure on the other side without fear; and keep yourself guarded against error: until there remains from the water nothing but a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If, however, you fear for the patient, and you discharge from the water a great quantity: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating in the bath and in the sun, and expect above the seat: and care for him with physicians of experience, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the water has been extracted, according to what I have said before
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As for the care of infants who are born in places where the urinary tract is not perforated
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When a child comes out of the womb of its mother and its head is not perforated, or that the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	One must therefore assist with the perforation of it immediately when it is born with a fine needle, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place in the opening a small lead weight, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it wishes to urinate, move it, and mix it up
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which is passing over the place will not permit it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	The one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it becomes wider.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	If the opening is in an unnatural position, they suffer.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	For in such a case the opening is at the end of the hair-growth: because it cannot reach forward until it has lifted the hair above.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there any generation, therefore, because the sperm cannot pass beyond the matrix in a straight line: and there is a wound which is painful to her.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of treatment in this is that the sick person be placed over his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch out his hair with your left hand stretching towards the heel, and cut off the head of the hair from its root, with a knife or a sharp spatula: as it is the cutting of hair, or as you would a radish, so that its middle part comes out like the head of hair: and that the opening be in the middle as it should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care that there be no flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times indeed this happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Oppose it therefore with that which cuts off the blood, and care for the wound until it is healed
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	And concerning the accidents which happen in the preparation of the wound and the head of the hair, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many of these things happen in the hair, and it is the prominence of the diseased tissue.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among these there are malignant and non-malignant things.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	The malignant one must be suspended with a fine thread and cut off, until the whole of it is gone
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon the wound the submerged heel in unguento Aegyptio.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound afterwards with a finer unguent until it has healed
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the wound is malignant, dark in colour, then it is necessary to apply cautery to it after making an incision and to remove the cause of the wound itself.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the wound is tightly closed and is part of the larger wound, and part of it is within and part of it is outside: then it is necessary to ligate the deeper part of the wound until it is consolidated, and then care for the outside of the wound. For if you care for both together, the wound will not be closed
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And sometimes also in testicles, and black and corrupted swelling
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore it is necessary to drain the whole of what is blackened and corrupted, and what wants to corrupt, or which is already corrupted
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply above it after that with honey which is softened with pounded barley and pounded thyme leaves
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it has healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, blood flows, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Cautery is useful in two situations simultaneously, namely for blood flow and for a wound which is corrupted
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the worm has become corrupted and is destroyed throughout in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the flesh of the worm, so that it may mix with the pus above it
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of an adhesion of the wound to the head of the worm, and this adhesion does not happen except in that case in which the wound is healed and does not require excision: and when it does happen in connection with the wound or its pus: it is necessary to scrape away the wound with a blunt spatula until the ligament is severed and the head of the worm is freed from all sides
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern the excellence of these things, then it is appropriate to excise something from the head or from the genitals.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	When the prepuce is subtle, it is perhaps pierced because of its slightness or quickly
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then care for it with vinegar, until it is solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Regarding the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors from accidents.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a complete solution like other wounds: indeed, when it comes from our operation, from our will, and when it is in the child itself, it is necessary to show in this operation a greater care, and to cause less suffering to the child.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is not except that we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Indeed, I have found among the artifices a greater part who make use of cutting and bleeding for the cleansing of infants, by circumcision with a needle and with scissors: and they use wine and ligature with a thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have tried all these methods, and I have not found a better cleansing of infants than with scissors, and ligation with a thread
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in the cleansing with a needle, much skin escapes
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin escapes, and threatens the lower layer: it is thought therefore to make an incision to reach the other, and to relieve the future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the modification is made by the affected part, that is, the digits, which the surgeons employ, it is not secure to make an incision at the extremity of the limb; for perhaps it will enter into the hole of it.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	And in the modification with the nail, perhaps the iron will go away, and will corrupt your work; for the skin of the child is short in nature, and many are born thus, which does not dispense with the modification: and I say that it is this which will aid it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	And with regard to the modification with the scissors, and the ligation with thread, a good experiment has been found to be this: for the scissors are proportional to the incision; therefore, as the sharpness which is above is like that which is below
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you have thus grasped the hand, the two sharpness are proportional, and they cut according to the operation at one time: and there is a compression like that which follows a figure, containing the skin of the limb from every part, so that no mistake is made at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the manner of the operation itself is this, that you make the excision, children especially, if there be any of them who understand their surroundings, that you do not make an incision, except that you ligate the thread in the limb itself: and you let it go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible, from that which receives intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared to their normal height, and do not sit: and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the children do not see them, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand into the limb, and blow into the skin, and pull it up, until the head of the limb comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then loosen the surrounding tissue from that which is aggregated in that cavity.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then secure the marked place with a doubled thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then secure the lower part with an inferior ligament alongside the main ligament.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb, and hold the place of the lower ligament securely, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the vein.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better thus) and put powder on top: and over the powder put a bandage which has been soaked in warm water, broken with a little fresh alum: and leave it on until the next day: and care for the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But as for the shape of the forceps for this purpose, it is like this
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two handles at each end, and the blades are joined: do not let the handle slip into the cleft of the claw: and let the length of the two blades be equal, like the length of two equal thumbs
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The danger in this procedure is that perhaps the underlying skin has escaped entirely, or a part of it has escaped at the incision site.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary to expand the surrounding area from your hour hand with your thumb before incisions: and make the incisions according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the surrounding area with your thumb, then grasp it with your index finger, and make the incision
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, three days pass and the swelling under the vein remains, remove the swelling: then let the swelling subside naturally, and remove the clot with ease, and make the incision as described above: and be careful from the head of the vein downwards
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	It will not harm him. For if it happens from the skin above the measure to the upper parts, it does not harm him even so.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	It will not harm him. For as we have said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Until he is healed.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by the formation of a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh, or similar things from which we have spoken in the method of treatment of dropsy
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not dissolve, and you think that the retention is because of a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary to be positioned with his knees bent over
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then join his feet over his back, and stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and grasp his thighs as much as possible for him
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He thinks therefore that with the neck of the bladder towards the back, the stone will be expelled: and the urine will be discharged
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it does not dissolve as we have said, and you think there is something above the infirmity: then you must administer the extraction with an instrument called a siringa, which is made of silver, is subtle, soft, and concave like the quill of a bird in the thickness of a radius, long like the palm of one hand and a medium: with a fine needle at its head
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way of extracting the urine is as follows: take a doubled thread and tie in its extremity a wool or cotton thread, a good ligation: and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and pierce with scissors if anything remains of the wool, but introduce into the needle with certainty, as when you are making an ass
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then apply the sponge with oil or butter, and vinegar: and let the patient sit upon a seat, and bind up the wound, and pour oil upon the wound with warm oil, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the sponge into the wound until it reaches the root of the wound
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the above from the navel upwards
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the sponge into the wound until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that the wound has gone past the painful part: do not do this except in the case where the wound has become taut.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread with the lancet gradually
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The vein follows the lancet.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw out the wound, and let the vein flow through the urine: and repeat the sponge, and do not cease doing this until the wound has evacuated its urine and the patient experiences relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the urine of Clepshydra
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When in the urine there is a wound, or the blood in it is frozen, or is solidified in pus, and it boils over in the urine: then let it be done with the instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is blind, that is, closed
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side, like water
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concaved place where it is pushed, where that which drives it rests, should be in proportion to the quantity which it desires without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is pushed out, when it is driven out far: according to what the Clepshydra does, which throws out pitch, that is, Greek fire in the fields of Mars
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When any liquid is thrown upon the cavity, introduce the extremity of the bladder towards the liquid and draw it up with that which urges it upwards, for the liquid is thus drawn into the concavity of the bladder.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extremity of the bladder into the cavity, as we mentioned in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then draw up the liquid with that which urges it upwards and immediately the humidity proceeds to the cavity, so that the patient feels its effect immediately
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Thus make a slight enema so that the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver or gold: whose head is like a small basin, and under it the sinus between which the ligament is placed
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then grasp the bladder from its neck and pour the liquid into it, which will cleanse the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie the two sinuses together with a strong ligament with a double thread: and warm the liquid somewhat above the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the enema into the cavity, then grasp your hand over the bladder with the liquid tightly bound downwards, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, the bladder is not present, then grasp a piece of sponge, and make of it a circle, and pierce it through from all its roundness
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the strong thread firmly through those holes, as they are twisted together
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the flax is gathered: after you have placed in it that which is exuded from the humilities, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in an instrument: and do it like that which was done with the bladder when expressing with your hand, until the liquid reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	On the Extraction of the Stone.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken concerning the types of Stone, and their treatment with physicians: and we have mentioned the difference between the Stone generated in other parts of the body, and the vesical Stone, and the signs of the latter: and we have mentioned that the operation for the Stone is performed with the hand and the incision: and that the Stone is generated in the bladder itself: and that which appears in the urine: and I will speak of this with manifest exposition and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the Stone which is generated in the bladder occurs most frequently in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the painful parts of the bladder, and causes them to swell, and causes great pain
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised up, and comes out with it through the anus in many people.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children from this is easy, until the age of fourteen
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in old age
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people, however, it is middle-sized, in which case its care is easier: and if it is small, the care of it is less expensive
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to purge the patient with clister, which removes all the stool which is in his intestines: for this indeed sometimes hinders the finding of the Stone in the inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken with his feet, and is struck, and moved downwards: so that the Stone may go down to the depth of the bladder, or be expelled from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit with his arms prepared between yours, and his hands under his buttocks, so that his belly may hang down freely to the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel a stone in the space, then immediately hold it with a section above it
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of the left hand if it is a child: or the middle finger if it is an adult: and insert it into the belly of the patient, and ask about the stone, until it rests under your finger: and slowly bring it to the bottom of the belly
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where the section is to be made: and command the minister to cut away the belly from the hand, and command another minister to extend the testicles of the right hand upwards: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the section is to be made
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sponge with the shape like this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the belly and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the left hip: and let the section be made above the stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, according to the quantity that allows the stone to escape from it without being greater
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is in the rectum will press the stone at the section and it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that the stone has angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult because of that
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from this is soft, like a gland, and round: and it facilitates the egress of its contents.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	And to it are added angles and margins to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not issue forth thus, then it is necessary that you introduce above it: or that you draw over it with your hand in the middle, whose extremities are like the Moon which is drawn over the Stone, and does not recede from it: or that you introduce under it an instrument which is fine and flexible at its extremities
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot overcome it from above, then enlarge the small opening.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything from the blood incites you, cut it off with a saw.</start_of_turn>
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then drive in the first one to the bone of the belly.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then break over the rest of it.</start_of_turn>
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then drive out the little ones after that: and do the same if there are more than two.</start_of_turn
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is great in size, then ignorance is not sufficient to cut through it with a large section.</start_of_turn
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the sick that two evils come together: or that he should die, or that there is a constant discharge of urine: because the place is not consolidated altogether.</start_of_turn>
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer the expulsion of it until it has gone out: or introduce a fracture in its fracture with scissors, until you have extracted it frustrated.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then apply a bandage of wool, aloes, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a soaked sponge of oil and wine, or oil of roses and cold water: so that the wound will be cooled.</start_of_turn
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then, suspend the patient supine over his own column, and do not loosen the ligaments until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bind up the place with much water and oil
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguent of rue, and unguent of alum, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however it happens that a blood clot has been added to the wound, and is corroded, and similar: thus also when blood is congealed in the bladder and is withheld from it: this is recognized from the emission of blood with the urine
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound, and extract the blood clot
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose all sorts of things with it which is useful for the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of cure of the whole thing, that you bind up two thighs, and join them together, for the cause of the physicians who put things on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small, and is in the meat of the bladder, and is fixed in it, and prevents the passage of urine: then care for it with that which I mentioned before until you reach the section
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Many times I have excused myself from this treatment because of this.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed in wood
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and bind it with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the abscess with ease, until it reaches the Perforatorium to the very stone: and withdraw the Perforatorium gradually from the stone: and make the perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine will immediately cease to flow.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then place your hand over what remains of the stone from the exterior of the abscess.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	The stone itself will break and go out with the urine, and the patient will be healed
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this cure is not prepared for him, because of something that hinders it: then bind a thread under the stone and a thread above the stone
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone within the abscess between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligature and stop the flow of frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to bind a thread under the stone, except that it does not go back to the orifice: and the other thread above, except when the thread is loosened after the stone has gone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to bind the upper thread so that it raises the skin upwards, so that the skin returns to its proper place and covers the wound, as we have said
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Of the Extraction of a Stone from a Woman.
Caput LXI.	(The text continues with instructions for the specific procedure of extracting a stone from a woman.)
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to any of them to have a stone, then the cure is difficult and is prohibited for various reasons
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: a woman who perhaps is a man.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you do not find a woman who confesses herself to be a doctor when she is chaste, or who is married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you do not find a woman who is well-skilled in this art, especially in surgery with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the stone: for it requires deep section, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to that, then you must take a female doctor who is well-skilled: and few are found.</start_of_turn>
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you wish, however, to take a man, take a chaste one, discreet, and present to him a skilled female midwife or a woman who has learned a part of the art: do this, and especially tell him about the stone from the inquiry.</start_of_turn>
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, look to see if the woman is a man: then you must insert your finger into her belly and feel for the stone.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If you find it, grasp it under your finger and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the lower belly of the patient and inquire about the stone, after placing your left hand over the flank and compressing it gently.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If you find the stone, then you must gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all your skill, until you have brought it down to the root of the hip bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut above it at the middle of the flank against the root of the hip bone, from whichever side you prepare it, and feel the stone in that place: and do not move your finger from the stone, holding it under it: and make the incision small at first.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he lets the radium enter through that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels a stone, then he adds to the section a quantity proportional to that which the stone has gone out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that there are many kinds of stones
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among them is the small one, the great one, the soft one and the rough one, the long one and the round one having a branch.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kinds of them, so that you may understand by this what is said above it
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If he sees blood flowing, then he adds in the place of the wound some burnt alum, and he keeps it for an hour, until the blood is clotted
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then he returns to his operation, until the stone comes out: and he makes ready with you the instruments which I mentioned for the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help him in his operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If he sees blood flowing, and you know that the evacuation of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then you put powder on the place, and bind it with threads of a decent size: and do not move it: and let the stone go, and do not pull it out
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the pain of blood has subsided after a few days, and the place has become softened, then he returns to his operation, until the stone comes out
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	About the incision for a watery hernia
Caput LXII.	Chapter 122.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not anything other than the accumulation of moisture in a white sac under the testicles containing urine: and it is called a hernia.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is within its proper membrane itself, which nature has prepared for it in part, until it is put out: that is something else, and is the covering of the testicles between the fat, which we have mentioned: and it does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these branches is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: whereupon it flows out to them this matter
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or, its color is declining towards citron, or it is reddish-bloody, or greenish, black, or pale yellow, and that is better
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white fat which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round about the length like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the proper membrane itself of the body, then the swelling is round with a part like an egg, and because of this the man knows that it is something else
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the covering of the testicles and the fat, then it goes under the sense
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one sees the color of the moisture, then to experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with the introduction of a square which has preceded in form.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which proceeds from the introduction, judge about that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with the iron, then it is necessary to take away from the sick person what is harmful, such as a phlebotomy if it is possible, and to fill his body with liquid
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then the thing rests upon its back upon a high thing slightly, and put under it many cushions.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit thou on its left side, and command the minister, that he sit on its right side, who shall extend his arm towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the belly which is near the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad sponge, and dry the testicles from the middle along their length, until near the navel: and make a cut according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane which encompasses: and scrape it off and observe, or cut it out: and thy scraping shall be as great as that which thou dost scrape from the part which hangs down with the greater testicle: and scrape gently according to the quantity which thou canst manage
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the membrane which encompasses the testicles: and cut the bladder as thou wilt, either entirely or in fragments, especially its width slightly
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if thou art not careful in thy inspection, there will be no security in the incision, that the water will not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however anything external proceeds from its skin in the hour of thy operation: then when thou hast finished the incision of the bladder, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it so that the rest of the wound be healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If thou find any black fluid from another place, then it is necessary that thou bind up the place, which is the suspending membrane, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then remove the testicle with the suspension, and extract the sperm: afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two roots: dry therefore the other part equally as you did in the other
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is made even, as for one operation, then do thus: then drain the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the sections the lancet dipped in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside the lancet another layer of lancet which you submerged in wine and oil, and expand above two testicles, and look into the belly: and put upon it doubled layers of wool, and there are sponges: and bind them up above with a ligament, which is having six according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take away two towels, and wash, and apply the carmine-colored unguent, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are sent forward from the shoulder, or wet wool: and gather with the tightening in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity shall take over upon one until the shoulder, and the second shall take over at the part of the loin: and two extremities upon two thighs lower, and two extremities the other upon two groin, and gather the whole tightening in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when it is necessary to treat this swelling artificially with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron: and it is that you take a fine cautery blade, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, as we have said: until when the white sponge containing water is detected: then take the cautery, according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The letters are assimilated like those in Greek
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then prick with it thus that swelling, and it is ignited, until the whole moisture comes out
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread the sponge with hooks, and burn away the fat with a fine flame, and cut it through as much as you can, until you have cauterized all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	Do not let the flame touch the tissue itself.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	You know that this operation is safer and longer lasting than the one with incision
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, you make the contrary movement in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cauterization afterwards, or there is blood flow, or something else of the like: then it is necessary to treat that which makes the contrary movement, with the treatment which suits it, according to what has been said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect to endure this operation on account of its horror: then I shall give an incision according to what I have mentioned above: and that is enough
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain that you have reached the point which we mentioned concerning the signification of the sensation which has subsided: then you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then make the perforation of the fat in the lower part of the body with a sponge hook: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and keep the opening wide open until all the fat has clotted.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place over the place of the buttock, and bind it, and let it go so that it may clot the remainder of the fat: then care for it until the wound has healed
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the escape of the water in the hour when you perform the perforation: and this is not except for the fact that a white pimple makes resistance to the opening of the wound and hinders the escape of the water: then you must introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the watery humors are extracted, whose form has preceded: or add to the operation of the wound a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	Know also that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates, it returns again in the same way, and passes through the sick man's days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the care of the marrow of the bones.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section above this Ramus, there is fear of producing infection in various positions
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its excision with salt from that is seen
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation for that, and the kind of dressing.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many abscesses happen in the body, from which testicles are composed: and this is from excessive eating of pork.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or chronic excess, or acridness which flows down to the testicles
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.</start_of_turn>
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it is not found to be painful: and it is a grave abscess.</start_of_turn>
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is from the swelling of arteries, and the inflation of them: as I mentioned before concerning its reminder: or from the swelling of veins.</start_of_turn
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which is from the swelling of the arteries, is known by the position of the abscess when you press it with your fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not behove that you touch it directly.</start_of_turn
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which arises from the inflation of veins does not disperse from it with any compression whatever with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	It is also possible that above this kind of swelling there may be a cutting, and above the rest of the flesh: and this is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the limb upwards, and draw it out with a white bandage: and release the swelling from the parts, and bind the part: and cut through the swelling after you have freed it from all sides of the limb
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If, however, the limb is solidified with these native parts of the body, then it is necessary to draw out the limb and cut through it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	If there is an adhesion between something of the veins, or in that which is between the parts: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and to make a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a natural part of the flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through the whole of that, and to draw out the limb, as we have said
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the operation is finished, then put a bandage over the wound which is infiltrated with fat in a rose-coloured oil, and wine: then care for the limb with the rest of the care, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the care of limbs, which is with speed.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 122.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Inflammation is a swelling which is surrounding and compressing the quadra, similar to a bag, with the softening of the testicles: and it makes it difficult for the infirm to move and exercise, and to walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this inflammation is from fear, because of that from which it proceeds is remembered
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then place your fingers under the testicles and grasp them with your hands which are close to the testicles: and hold them with another hand and extend them with an extension of your hand.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then make a transverse incision with a sharp knife over the testicles until the testicles are detected
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then remove the testicles from all sides, as we have said concerning the arteries which are in the groin
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then fix a piece of gut with a knot in the middle, where the veins are, and tie the knot again at the end of the gut.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then dry it in the middle of a straight incision according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the moistness of corrupt feces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. Then take care of the wound with care of the rest of the wounds, so that the testicles which feed one of the testicles are not nourished.
Non est enim malum per illud.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. There is no evil in this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	Truly, it is necessary to say that the operation must be performed as they did in the first instance. But if the veins are all severed from the testicles, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the veins: so that nothing is left to nourish them, because of the incision, and that they do not fester, but rather die and become useless.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the care of the Ramus of the intestine.
Caput LXV.	On the care of the Ramus of the intestine.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this Ramus is from a section that happens in the large intestine above the belly in the groin part from the belly of the intestines.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Because the intestines descend from that break to one testicle
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	This break is either from the siphoning or from the extension of it
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two kinds happen from many causes: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from a cry, or from the elevation of a heavy thing, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it is from the extension of the siphoning
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen immediately: and it is a swelling equal to the depth: because the siphoning compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it is when it is from the section of the siphoning, because it makes the pain that arises immediately: and it is a swelling of various kinds, appearing under the skin nearby: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the outside of the siphoning
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine along with a ball: and this is called the Ramus of the intestine, and a ball: and when it happens with a swelling.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into the intestine with stool, and is retained there: and this is with great sickness: because it makes arise pain in the belly, and especially when it is let go.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these diseases of the intestine with iron, fear is to be had: because it is necessary to prevent the cause of it
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the manner of the operation is that you must urge the principal illness to reduce the intestine to its own concavity, if it obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it rests upon its collar between your hands: and elevate its edges.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin towards the upper parts, and dry the whole scrotum thoroughly along its length
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two points of the incision the intestines which are opposite to each other, according to what is necessary to open the section with the intestines: and the incision should be made according to the quantity which is possible, that it may escape from it all things
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then strip the fat and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white fat is detected, hard throughout: then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white fat which is under the skin and the white fat which is between the fats.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand towards the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white fat upwards, with your left hand: and elevate the gut with the fat towards the part of the incision: and command the minister to extend the gut upwards: and you shall solve the adhesion which is at the complete solution
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek with your fingers that there be nothing left of the intestine in the white fat or hard
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything there: then push it downwards into the lower belly
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then grasp the clamp, in which is a thick thread made of ten threads: and insert it at the end of the white fat, that is, the tunica which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there remain four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then form some of the edges over some others in the shape of a cross: and bind with silk thread, as we have said, because it is under the skin of the testicles that the ligament is firmly fixed, until it cannot bear any of the uses which nourish them to send anything to them: so that it does not happen that after the abscess becomes cold.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put the ligament again outside the first ligament, long enough to be less than two fingers from it
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments let go from the testicles, which are under the skin of the testicles, in the quantity of the magnitude of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely according to the roundness, and take out from it all.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles by cutting, from which blood runs, and heal: as we have narrated before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply soaked wool under the fat, and put in a wound: and administer the ligament which we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white fat which we mentioned has been cauterized, after cutting it out with fear of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament, until it falls down by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its case is delayed, then it will be embroidered with warm water: and put over that which we have mentioned, until it falls down
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the care for wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Of a swelling that has a root.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In the case of a swelling which has a root, no one should be allowed to handle it with a knife.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all, they say, it is like that which we have narrated in Ramice which is with Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	And first of all, they say, it is like that which we have narrated in Ramice which is with Vite. That is, as a limb hangs loose after its section above it is easy to dry out in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it until the limb falls away: and care of the wound, as we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the disruption which happens in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture happens in the groin, as we have said, and the place hangs out, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little and returns in every hour: truly if it is prolonged with that time, a tear is added in the groin until the intestines descend into the groin
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin, as we have said
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the groin is extended: then it is softened and the place hangs out, and it hangs out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cautery, as it was mentioned before
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, in this way: and the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture after it has hung out, and cut across the breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the intestines and those which are under the skin, until the fat is revealed which is under the skin following it
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a needle and put it over the place that hangs out from the fat, and press it into the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two points above the extremity of the radius from the sutures, and join them with a suture one with the other: then extract the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not perforate the gut at all, neither draw out any strings or anything else, like I told you in the treatise on intestinal branches
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then take care of this cure of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have cut the thread, soften it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Do not pull against each other, and do not add prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the marrow.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Of the softening of the skin of testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of testicles is softened in many people, because the meat which is between them is softened, and its aspect is improved
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is treating him to make him urinate on his back, and to cut away the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, make a surplus of the softened skin by means of three or four sutures, and tighten the suture
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then take care of the cure of the remaining wounds until they are healed, and take out the stitches.
¶ De Castratione.	Of castration.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that Castratio has been excluded from our law: therefore, I am permitted not to recall it in this book. It is not necessary to recall it except for two cases.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	For one thing, it is necessary that it be mentioned in the science of medicine whenever Castratio is inquired about: and that one know its treatment when it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other is that we often need to perform castration on some animals because of the stench they emit on account of our perfumes, such as asses, hircuses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that Castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cutting off.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and division
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the former method, however, the operation is as follows: we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles become soft and limp, and then we cut off the testicles with our hands until they are completely severed and no longer perceptible to the touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and division, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly and grasp the testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie off the surrounding area, and cut through the skin over the testicles only as much as is necessary: when two testicles have protruded, then cut through them after you have scraped away everything except the fine fat, which is above the veins.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that by attrition: for it perhaps leaves something of the testicles, which the animal desires for coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it is healed
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	There are two methods for caring for Hermaphrodites.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The hermaphroditic condition originates from two sources.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of these is that it appears in the space following the testicles, or on the surface of the testicles, between two testicles, like the shape of a female vulva, which has hair: and sometimes urine runs from the area on the surface of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	There is another kind among women, which is like a female vulva resting on the abdomen just like small testicles, protruding outwards: one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	The treatment for all three types, two of which are hermaphroditic and one which is female, is: to cut away the added flesh until the imprint of the condition has disappeared.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the remaining wounds
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind of hermaphroditism from which urine comes out through the testicles on the surface, there is neither operation nor any treatment for it
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	As for the incision of the tenticle and the protruding flesh in the female genitals
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tenticle may perhaps be added upon something natural, until it becomes deformed and unsightly: and sometimes it swells in some women so much that it expands like that in men, and persists until coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is therefore necessary to remove the supernumerary tenticle, with or without a vein, and cut: and do not hesitate in the incision, especially not in the deep root: so as not to cause the flow of blood
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it heals
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The belly is that which is born from the matrix until it fills itself: and sometimes it departs to the outside according to the shape of the tail: and for this reason they call the disease of the tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore we must proceed thus as we proceed with Tentigin and cure it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Of the care of the fistula, which is the swelling of a woman which is not perforated.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.</start_of_turn
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The fistula is, as it is a swelling of a woman which is not perforated, or as it is a small opening.</start_of_turn
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from the disease which preceded it: and this itself is either from the native flesh added, or from fine sand, or from pus: and it is either in the depth of the matrix, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coitus and impregnation, and delivery, and perhaps hinders menstruation.</start_of_turn
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if there is an apparent prolapse of the opening.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then inquire with your fingers, or with an X-ray.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the prolapse is from fine sand, and is close to two teeth: then proceed carefully, and break it.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is like putting over two lips two little pillows.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your two index fingers of both hands together, and the woman sit with her back expanded and her knees spread wide.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend two lips with force, until the delicate sac is ruptured, and the opening is revealed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then grasp the lip, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman drink every day, so that it does not solidify in another place.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the sac is thick and tough: then it is necessary to cut it with a knife like the blade of a myrtle leaf
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the opening is natural from the flesh: then suspend the lip with hooks, and cut it: and there be with you medicines which flow blood without causing harm, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus it is aggregated with alum or white powder.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that it does not solidify too quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer vinegar from dry lino, then care for the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when it is born in the matrix of other flesh: it is necessary to cut according to this manner: while there is no cancerous tumor in the matrix, do not oppose with iron in any way
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red ones in women's veins.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins near the opening of the rectum, because of the great flow of blood in them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids are thus lessened, they become little; and I have already spoken in the discourse concerning the species of these and their signs: and here I will tell you what is useful for their treatment, and what is not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, that hemorrhoids which are in the matrix opening, and which do not appear to sense: then there is no need for treatment with iron
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Whatever exists in the cavity of the uterus above which sensation is lost, is to be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you immerse the woman in a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the lobe with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut away the roots from them.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the roots above the flow of blood from one incision without causing damage: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her to bed in cold water
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is therefore separated with it, that is good: and if not, make it adhere to the swellings, and blisters, without incision
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak in the juice of tarth, or the juice of arnica, or the juice of elderberry leaves, that is, aloe, wine of Ponticus, and make it adhere to the wound
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the swelling has subsided, then care for the place with unguents, until it is healed
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Though it is white in colour like hair, and has a rough appearance
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said above: and care for it, until it is healed
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On perforation of the Exitura [a vein] which happens in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	On perforation of the Exitura which happens in the matrix.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various kinds of abscesses happen in the matrix, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcer, foreign body, alekilati, herpes, aestiomemus, fistula, hemorrhoids, ragus, thelil, and cold abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I shall say concerning all these ailments and their kinds, their signs, and their treatment in general: it is necessary to speak in this treatise of the cold abscess which happens in the matrix, when it is caused by other abscesses which join health, and to know how to open it with a knife.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary to consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	If the pain of the abscess is acute with percussion, flame, and fever: and you see it turning red: do not attempt to open it immediately: take care of it with something which promotes its maturation, until the acute inflammation subsides.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to make her sit on a seat which supports two seats, and she should recline, or be laid across her back, and rest her feet on the lower part of the belly: and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her knees, and bind both straps conveniently to that.</start_of_turn
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then sit on the right side the obstetrician, and administer the instrument with which you open the orifice of the matrix.</start_of_turn>
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which has the shape of the things which are after.</start_of_turn
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument, to hold the liver with a deep grasp of the matrix of the woman: so that it does not go deeper into the matrix than is necessary, and does not harm the lower part.</start_of_turn
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument be more shallow than profound, it is necessary that you place plugs over the covering of the profound matrix: in order to prevent the entrance of the entire instrument into the profound matrix. And it is necessary that you place a plug, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that you hold the instrument, and that you turn the minister of the plug until the profound matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the exit appears, and the hand grasps it, and it is soft and yielding: then it is necessary that you cut it off at its head with a broad spatula.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the healthy parts have been evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a cushion soaked in rose oil: or in olive oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the cushion, and withdraw the section from the profound matrix.</start_of_turn>
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the matrix, and over the wound a bandage of wool soaked in water, in which there are bulges of evil.</start_of_turn>
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then care after two days with an unguent which agrees with it, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the wound are washed, it is to be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which there is a radix of lily, or longwort: then return to the unguent.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound has been hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary that you hinder its treatment with iron, rather treat it with that which we said in the instruction.</start_of_turn>
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Concerning the doctrine of midwifery, how to treat the embryos of women, according to an unnatural figure of egress.</start_of_turn
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter Lxx.</start_of_turn>
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to know in the first instance the figure of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to know in the first instance the figure of natural birth.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, you must immediately grasp the uterus so that the embryo may descend more quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over the head, it descends with the second [part] also, and is delivered with those [signs] which are above-mentioned.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever does this for another part is unnatural and harmful.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out feet first, and the body comes out before the head, and the feet and hands together, or the head and hand: or the belly comes out: or perhaps the head strikes against the collarbone, and similar things happen from unnatural figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to be wary of error and excessive force. I show you all the figures of these things and how they are performed, and I explain their significance, and I stand over them.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out head first at its natural delivery, and if it is delivered over the woman, and if it is difficult for her to part, and if the water breaks: then let her sit down, or let the women hold her up. And let her breathe slowly with a decocted vinegar solution and with oily unguents.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician introduces his thumb between the toes of the fetus and finds the second [finger], and grasps it with his finger, until it is freed from the moisture: and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary to instill a woman from the fenugreek mucilage with ole of sesame.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to supinate after instilling, that she cover her belly with the palm of her hand, and keep her mouth and nose closed for one hour
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out at once, then it is necessary to reduce them gradually
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not yield inwards, then place a woman upon a seat, and elevate her feet above her head: then press the seat against the earth: and the woman should be kept steady, that she does not fall upon the concussion
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut open the abdomen, and extract the fetus: and bind the hand with a cloth, and extract it with an equal force: for it will come out itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The emergence of the fetus through the feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out through the feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then gradually turn the fetus: afterwards equalize it
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take hold of one foot and extend it gradually
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out up to the hips, then command her to cover herself, and make her lie down: they will come out by themselves, if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if they do not come out as we have said, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out by itself when its time comes.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it be forbidden with all that we have said: then take from the slime of elderberry, and ole of sesame, and gum dissolved: and pierce all through in the mortar by a good blow. Then line with it the vulva of a woman, and below the entrance of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until the jaundice follows.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When the lower parts are relaxed by the heat, then make for her a sieve of myrrh: and support her
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the sieve for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her expectorate: and bind her jaw and nose: and press the lower part of her belly with pressure from below.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the urine will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus comes out over the knee and hand
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then it will enter inwards gradually putting out its hand.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies down on her neck, and hangs her legs down to the lower parts: and she lies lying on a bed, and she covers her hand with her own hand
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	And press above her belly gradually
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	And draw out what is under her feet from the nails, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take hold of her feet, and move them towards the navel.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the jaundice gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then put out her hand gradually, and equalize the fetus slowly: and command the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus hangs laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The fetus hangs laterally from the hands. Reduce the hand
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If it is not possible to reduce the hand, then elevate the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is unable to walk, then make her lie on a stretcher: and beat her thighs with a blunt object until she feels pain
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the unguents which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she feels relief in the part, then make her sit on a chair
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman groan and instruct her to compress herself until she is delivered.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus has emerged over his collar, with his hands spread out, and his face is towards the back of his mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The obstetrician must grasp the fetus's hand and gradually rotate him, aligning him with ease
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When he is aligned, then place on his navel the unguents which we mentioned from wax and mucilages
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move slowly
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean towards her right side
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress: and make her groan with effort.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is ready to be born on the right side
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended through the birth opening in this way with the second foot, then break the second foot with your thumb until it is expelled from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If the fetus hangs suspended over the face and the neck, then cut the cord from the navel: so that it does not remain and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you have placed the cord according to what is necessary: and command the woman to press her hand lightly: for he will himself come out through the easy birth opening.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born multiple: and sometimes three or four are born together.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	It is true, but it is rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five things indeed are outside of nature, and do not live long: and they are retained together, although multiplied, by one: and they are separated by the navel-string of each of them
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural birth opening, easily: and they come out through the difficult birth opening, as we have told you.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If, however, some of them are difficult at the time of birth, and remain until they reach the figures which we have mentioned as unnatural, then care for them as we have told you: and let the midwife be gentle, and do what she does with ease and with delay, and adapt herself to every figure as she is prepared for her from the ingenuity leading to safety
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that they are formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more are formed in the womb: and I have seen a woman give birth to seven and another to fifteen, all of them formed
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is done by the measurement of the glorious learned man
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore all must be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	It is perhaps like that: it opposes it just as it must oppose that which is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with medicine as I said in the discourse on medications, and it does not go out, and you must perform an operation with the hand, then you must consider it.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a healthy woman is virtuous and there is no risk of losing her due to any accident, then you must cause the woman to recline over the lectum, over her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs elevated: and the minister should hold her from both parts, or she should be bound to the lectum, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matricis with oily substances with high mucilage, and sponges of aloes, and linseed seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the Obstetrician wet his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he will introduce the hand into the matrix with ease
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he will feel where the ribs are fixed to the fetus, and the convenient place for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the ribs in the eyes, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate itself, or under the beard, or under the hyoid bone, or in nearby places to the ribs, and under the hypochondria
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is over its feet, then in the groin and the middle ribs
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that the hook grasp the thumb with the right hand: and place the curve of its arch in that which is between the digits of the left hand: and insert it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until it reaches the desired thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	And then fix the other hook opposite to it, or the third, if necessary: so that there is an equal contraction, and it does not incline to one side
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	And then extend it evenly, and it should not be extended only in a straight line, but rather move towards all parts, so as to alleviate its emergence: as it is done with a tooth when extracting it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between these, so as to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if it be retained from that, then the Obstetrix must grasp any digit with wax, and insert it from the side, so as to rotate it with that which is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If, therefore, a part of the fetus goes out, then change the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out whole
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If, therefore, the hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its coarseness: then it is necessary that it be covered over with the thumb
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	And then draw out the hook until when it comes out whole, cut it either on the joint of the thumb or on the nail, or in the heel: and it is necessary that you make the hook in the other hand, and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the head of the fetus is large, or if there is a constriction in its exit, or there is water gathered in its head: then it is necessary to insert between the digits the Spatumile spinous, and grasp it with that, and draw out the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of great head size, then it is necessary to remove the afterbirth: either by extracting it along with the placenta, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.</start_of_turn>
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head comes out, and remains at the vulva: then it is found, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If, however, it does not become complicated, and does not yield to extraction: then cut off the head as best you can, as is possible to you.</start_of_turn>
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there is an afterbirth below the belly, or in swelling: then it is necessary to perforate it, until the moisture from it comes out.</start_of_turn
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is above its feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal bone is gentle.</start_of_turn
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is caught at the abdomen, or the chest: then it is necessary to extract it with the cloth which you have placed over your hand: and find the abdomen, or the chest, until the moisture that is in it comes out.</start_of_turn
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the rest of the limbs are removed, and the head returns: then let the obstetrician insert his left hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If, therefore, the maternal bone is open: then insert your hand deeply into the womb, and grasp the head with your fingers until it reaches the maternal bone: then insert a single hook, or two hooks, into it, and grasp it with them.</start_of_turn
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the maternal bone is closed, because of a thick afterbirth that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to toil over it, but it is necessary to administer an effusion of liquid and fat: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.</start_of_turn
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its normal size, it is possible to equalize it: then the usual remedy is administered for the fetus which is present.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to equalize it, then it is forced out and extracted.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything remaining inside the body.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed the operation, then the usual remedy is administered for the postpartum chills which occur in the womb.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then descend in slippery substances, and administer the remaining treatment.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whom there was a dead fetus: then she was impregnated above that liquid again, afterwards another fetus died also.</start_of_turn
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happened to her after a long time that there was an abscess in her belly, and it became inflated, until it was opened: and pus began to flow out.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to her care and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.</start_of_turn
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed over it some strong adhesive plaster: and it came out of the place.</start_of_turn
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed by, and another bone came out.</start_of_turn
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am amazed at this, since there is no bone in her womb.</start_of_turn>
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that there must be the bones of the dead fetus.</start_of_turn>
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I inquired about the wound and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better conditions: and I treated her for a long time, and she stopped emitting pus.</start_of_turn
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment.
Caput LXXVII.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment. Here below is the shape of the Strictor, with which books are equalised, to which are equal two handles at the ends of two sticks.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment. True to this, these vertigo must be made subtler than the strictor: and to do this, either from ebony or from seasoned wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment. And the breadth of every stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are fastened in both, of whose length is half of the palm and a little, and whose breadth is like two fingers, or less
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment. And these two additions are introduced into the matrix bone, so that they open when two Vertigines are turned together.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	And I have not fixed this foreign matter until I have ascertained that there is knowledge within it, and an aid for that which the artful physician administers with his hand from the care of the ailment. The shape of the Vertige which opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form like that, subtler and smoother.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It may be made from seasoned beech or horn, according to the resemblance of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Two appendages are to be added at its extremity, as above: and the length of each appendage is like the palm of the hand, and the width of each is two fingers wide
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with this, then make her sit over a bench, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her thighs
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two appendages joined together into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like when you are using forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the Obstetrix has done what she wishes
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo which the ancients called the Impelling Force which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form which counteracts the large head: and is assimilated to the forceps which have teeth at their extremities, like the teeth of the forceps
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is oblunged, like the forceps following this form, like the teeth of the forceps which have teeth like serrations, so that it incides and counteracts
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form which counteracts the small head
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The Vncini form which has a spine like a single thorn
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The Vncini form which has two spines
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The forceps form which has teeth like serrations, with which the head of the fetus is countered
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the spatumilis has two extremities to cut off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatumilis also has two extremities
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more numerous the species are that are prepared by the artificer, the swifter will be the operation and the greater its height among men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	There is no need to despise any of these instruments, because they are all prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is not excusable to omit any of them
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the second (tooth)?
Caput LXXVIII.	Head number 78
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second is retained in the part, then it is necessary to split the lower incisors in order to retain the breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make a groove with the forceps: and grasp the hand over the bone, and restrain the breath of the patient.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, that is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then grasp the root firmly, and perforate at the junction of the bone: and place in it savory herbs such as calamine, rue, and chamomile, and saffron, and rue, and cassia twig, and centaury: grasp all of these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them over a fire
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bundle of reeds over the hole in the pot, and the other extremity in the bone: and keep it held until the vapor has reached the cavity of the bone
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make a groove as we said before
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second will then come out easily
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, after this treatment, he still remains and does not depart: then command the Obstetrician to immerse his hand in the brim of the olive oil or in the thick mucus of the elder.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he shall insert it into the anus and seek with it the second [part].
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then he shall grasp it and draw it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, there be an appendix in the depth of the belly, then he shall insert the hand again, as we have said, until he has found the second part. And he shall draw it out gradually following the rule, so that the belly does not tear at the time of drawing out: it is necessary, therefore, to shift it with ease to the right and left sides: and then add in the quantity of the drawing out.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will obey him then, and will be healed, and will depart from the adhesion
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	As for if the belly-wall is closed, as we have said before: treat it with vomiting and with a medication of oil with herbs
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not depart with all that we have said, then beware lest you tire yourself out in the process of drawing out.</start_of_turn>
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true that it must come out at the os of the belly towards the woman's hipbone.</start_of_turn>
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint the belly with unguent of four herbs.</start_of_turn
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	This will make the belly putrefy after days, and will dissolve, and will depart.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it has putrefied, it will emit a bad odor from the belly and the head, and will cause pain in that place, and make the patient weak.</start_of_turn

¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the care of an unpierced animal.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.</start_of_turn>
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their navels unpierced, and whom I have seen oiled with subtle saffron.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore that the midwife pierce that with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a sharp needle: and be careful of the tear, lest it touch it.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put upon it infused wool in wine and oil.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with nails, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If indeed it is to be oiled, then put in the hole a lead cannula for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to urinate.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And indeed the oiling of the navel also takes place from the consolidation of the wound, or from the afterbirth.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be dried up, and then care for it as we have said concerning care and lead.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Of the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are of two kinds: Nodation, and Grossitudo, which occur close to any deformity: either in the space of one part or in several places.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When thus the Nodulation is treated, it is opened up and white aqueous moisture or subtle pus runs out of it
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.</start_of_turn>
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating fistulas are recognized by the evacuation which proceeds from them, and the swelling, when the patient evacuates with pain: and sometimes it issues from worms also.</start_of_turn
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas of the kind when they are penetrating right up to the bladder, and right up to the marrow of the bone.</start_of_turn>
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating right up to the hip joint, and right up to the node of the buttocks.</start_of_turn>
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	And thus it is known that a penetrating fistula right up to the bone, even if not penetrating, is that you introduce your finger into the part, and introduce something subtle into the fistula from the air, or from iron: when there is no distortion.</start_of_turn
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is distortion in these, then introduce into the part a subtle lead weight, or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel the weight, or until the hair enters your finger.</start_of_turn
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	When you do not feel the sensation of the tip, neither is there any evacuation from the wound, neither swelling, nor worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: proceed therefore to the treatment.</start_of_turn
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	When the fistula has penetrated as far as the bladder or the meat of the urine: then its significance is the discharge of urine from that point, and the prohibition of that from this point in order to consolidate the place with the physicians.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	When the fistula has penetrated as far as the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that it extends up to that point, if there is no curvature of the fistula up to the bone: and the appearance of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always escapes from that point: and that there is no benefit in that from the medicine, neither is it consolidated with the unguent
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the cure of them is toil and constancy, from the stupid doctors, over whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those which are not penetrating and are not old, hope of recovery is expected with rest: as I have said above, and as I have proved: and it is that the patient should lie between your hands over his back: and lift up his legs up to above his hips, and his hips should be inclined towards his belly
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air, if there is curvature of the fistula, until you know where the tip has gone.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels pain around the part: then it is necessary to insert your finger as a sign into the part
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger that the fistula is penetrating by itself without you having recognized it, besides that you feel between your finger and the flesh, or bone: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: for there is no benefit in that, because it is not its cure, as we have said
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some men the wound heals by itself, and from the medicine which is expected to be given to him, it is that you should apply a subtle cautery according to the breadth of the fistula, as it has been said before, and introduce the flame into the fistula until it has gone round the part
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh has become softened like the pennae of a bird.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with softened butter until the flesh comes out: then treat it with unguents which generate flesh and consolidate it
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will not be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the limb comes out and does not reach up to your thumb which is in the groin, and is between the thumb and the thick hair of the flesh, or if there is a fistula there: then make an incision in that which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you dry with the thumb which is in the fistula until the cutting reaches the end of the thumb, and the thumb comes out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften those softened flesh which have become like the pennae of a bird, so that nothing remains of them
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood comes between you and the operation, and separates between you and the operation as you cut those flesh: then it is better that you cauterize with fire, or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For indeed cauterization with fire unites good habits, adds the adulation of those added flesh, and cuts blood, and dries moisture
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with softened butter or poultices until the place emits pus, and the softened flesh comes out in the pus
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat it with a wound which is consolidated with unguents which generate flesh: and these are medicines which have stypticity and drying power
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When restoration is complete, then healing takes place: and not by repeated efforts.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	When, however, the fistula persists even to the depth of the bowels, and is prolonged by the excess of bodily humours: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire concerning the extent of the fistula.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel resistance, and between you and the fistula there is soft swelling of fat or flesh, and there is proximity to the penetration: then there is no operation in that place, except with great trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For in such a case one must use three methods: or else cauterise the fistula itself, as we have said: or dissect it, until you have reached its cavity, so that you can afterwards introduce remedies and achieve a cure from the next moment
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the dissection, lest you lacerate the wall of the rectum, and cause excessive discharge of faeces without will
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal by itself: or stretch out the swelling and dry it when it is almost close to the rectum, as we have said, or by means of a hook or other sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then wipe clean the tissues which are left after the dissection, until where the mark of the incision disappears.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	And try to restore the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be less painful
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	When you suture the fistula in this way: and that is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is at the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforated extremity, which is like a needle with a head, that is, prepared for the skin, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert within the loop of the thread which is bound up from five threads, and round about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	And insert the needle with the thread into the fistula, until it follows the curvature of its opening.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, however, it has pierced the inner margin of the anus near the opening, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you may insert your finger into the anus, and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and bind both of them, and let it go on one day, or two days: and the more the thread has penetrated the flesh, the more tightly you should bind it, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have become soft and fallen away: then take care of the wound, until it is healed, and the fistula is cured
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not pierced: then make it pierce in whatever way you consider suitable, except that it be too deep
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	And do not make it pierce too violently, lest you damage it
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	And do as we have said above, until it is healed
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Make the sponge of spicery which is found in the fistula, the curvature of which is acute above, and the part which is not acute below, so that it does not damage that which is not necessary, like water
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	As for the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs out of the incision of them: and the care of the wounds.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, like the stones of a bean or a plum: or they are like the seeds of an olive tree
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And they are small and large: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many of them
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And there are outside the knee, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	And those which are outside the knee are mostly few in humidity, from which yellow urine or somewhat thick blood flows: and they are of the colour of the body itself.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	The treatment of that which is inside the knee is, to give the patient something to stimulate the bowels: and to express, until the anus comes out, and the other parts appear.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend with hooks: or hold with your thumb.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut through at the roots of these things.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, they do not remain in the grasp of the hook, because of the humidity of these things and their softening: then cover them with rough cloth, or with a coat of coarse wool, and draw them out with your fingers
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut through, and powder over the cut whatever fine powder you like, so that it stays in the place of the burn.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or burn them according to what has been said in the chapter on burning
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the knee with the rest of the treatment, until it heals
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	And if the anus does not come out spontaneously, then instill the patient with a small enema, so that it be urged out along with the urine, and comes out quickly when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	And if the other parts are outside the knee, then the matter is easy, and is like that of a hook: you can grasp them with your thumb, or grasp them with the hook, and cut through them
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for the knee as we have said, until it heals
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	Whoever abhors incision with a knife must administer suture accordingly.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the thread and pass it through the point.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the needle to the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root from the opposite side: and pass through two extremities of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and make them lateral: and tighten the knot firmly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and draw out the needle.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the knots, and let go of the needle: neither do you retain it, lest you cause excessive bleeding.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put over it a soaked bandage of linen in rosewater, or alum, and put the latter over it: and command the patient to rest.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go, until it drops off.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When they have dropped off, take care of the wound with unguents, and leave the treatment until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn

Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When these have ceased, and they do not yield to medical treatment: then it is necessary to ligate with a sponge or with your finger, until they become soft, and the outer layer is removed from the wound which hinders consolidation.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the wound, until it consolidates as it should.</start_of_turn
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.

¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of the swelling of the marrow of the teeth and not of the teeth: and of the swelling of the gums, and of the ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Concerning the treatment of the swelling of the marrow of the teeth and not of the teeth: and of the swelling of the gums, and of ants.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that Almirmar is not anything other than a round node according to the color of the body, like the head of a nail: and it is found throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it arises from inflammation of pain while walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that it be cut off which is around the nail, and be held with forceps, or with a needle, and be eradicated from its root
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for this: and if you wish you can cauterize it according to what is written in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	As for ants, one of them is a small, rough, filtered, rounded elevation above the surface of the body
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they appear in the hands of children many times
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is that you extend the ants and cut them off: or you tie them up with a silk thread: or with hair, until they fall off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is stated previously with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the inward ants are eradicated, and not the outward ones with the instrument which I say
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And as for ants, it is also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, which extends inwards downwards: and when it meets with cold, it feels like the bite of an ant, and it occurs throughout the body: and most of them occur in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a thorn from the claw of a cat, or a strong bristle: and put it on the ant, until it encloses the circle of the bristle from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the cannula until it severs what is around the Formica: and place it in the depth of the flesh, and extract the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	Or if you wish, do this with an air or iron cannula, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn>

Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	This is what is administered in the treatment of young children with loose or painful lungs, as well as those clistera.</start_of_turn
Clistere magnum.	Large clistera.</start_of_turn
Cistere paruum.	Small clistera.</start_of_turn
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is tied, should be broad according to this manner: and should have a distinction so that the uterus is tied like water, and the lower part which goes into the belly should be solid, that is, not open, soft, flexible, drawing towards smoothness: and on one of its sides there are two holes, and on the other side a single hole.</start_of_turn
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The diameter of the opening should be according to the length of the rays; more so the larger, and less so the smaller. And let there be a space within, in which the instruments are placed from the belly of the animal: either from parchment or from skin, which is according to the shape of a small ass. And its root is a single palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	The opening should be perforated with many holes as it is turned, and there should be space between each hole equal to the thickness of a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into the holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and twist it together like an ass's hair
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	And when it is placed in this space, it is strung in the head of the clips between two distinguishing constrictions of strength.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	And then clip it with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the circle which is here depicted, and of the holes
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the clipping with it is: to grasp the belly or the belly from the medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too cold
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	And then the patient is laid upon his back, and raises his legs towards the upper parts: and place under it a cushion, that is, skin over which men lie, or linen
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	And then apply the extremity of the clips with oil, or with alum, or with barley mucilage, or with things of a similar kind.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	And then introduce it into the hole with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	And then grasp the belly with both hands and press it out until it evacuates all that is in the clip into the intestines
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the physician thinks that he should remove it, then he should retain as much as he can
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps throughout the night, this is the most important thing in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you apply the Clistere to the inner parts of the belly, and it brings about the evacuation of its contents: then repeat the Clistere until it is healed
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the rectum, then let the Clistere be gentle and soft, from the Clisteres that are given to children
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle Clistere which is above that which is strict of the skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head wound number 84
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the discourse about the treatment of wounds that it agrees with the book, and I will say here the treatment of them with the hand and also with the help of physicians as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are varied according to the thing which causes them, and according to the place where the wound falls
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	So also the wounds which are made by many things are like the blows of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and like these from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds, however, which are caused by the place of the body are like a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the limbs: and like these from many parts of the body
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	I am reporting on the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may present a ratiocination and regulation concerning the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	I shall begin with the simple head wounds: for the recollection of compound wounds is at the beginning of the third chapter
Dico ergo.	Thus I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound on the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if there is discharge of gravel, or like substances, and if the wound is only superficial: then it is a great wound, and the parts surrounding it are liable to become inflamed because of the heat: then take off the part immediately, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy without delay: and do not delay: and extract from it as much blood as is in its power according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing to prevent it, especially if there is little blood flowing from the wound
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wound
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient be warned against repletion, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however anything prohibits diminution [of the wound], then let him abstain from food, and not approach flesh or drink wine.</start_of_turn>
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply to the wound if it happens to him a soft swelling, a poultice of fat bound up in rose-colored earth, or with wine in which there is styptic matter.</start_of_turn
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are secure from the soft swelling, then apply to the wound, if there is blood clot adhering to it, and has not changed its colour, the powder which I will tell you of later: and if it has changed its colour, then apply over it some unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is great, or is from a cut of a knife, and like these: and the edges of it do not adhere by means of little hairs, then adhere them together with a suture, according to what I shall say concerning the sutures of these wounds.</start_of_turn
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, a vein is detected to be hanging loose, and it is not possible to retain it, except in a small suspension: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Care for the vein with the physicians, and restore it in the place of the skin, and command the patient to eat food which is solid in the stomach, such as heads of garlic, and barley boiled, until the pulse is restored: and such things are similar to it.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the flesh putrefaction, which does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part entirely, and throw it away: then care for the wound
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in the wound there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire concerning the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If, therefore, you find it not severed, cut it off with sponges, or ligate it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is severed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple: then the matter is easy and light: so that it is sufficient to sprinkle upon them this powder: because it will consolidate them before they change from air.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of application of the powdered dressing.</start_of_turn>

Recipe: mix one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts burnt lime: mix them all together thoroughly, and sprinkle them over the wound, and bind the wound securely, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then stretch it out over feathers, and send it away, and do not keep it until it has become dry, for it will spoil.</start_of_turn
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine.

Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine.
Caput LXXXV.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Until it is healed, it does not vanish from this medicine
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed a wound is deep, or occurs in that sinus in its lower part where pus is gathered, then perforate it in a depressed spot in that place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed a wound has incised an artery, and blood flow has ensued: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or cauterize it if need be.</start_of_turn>
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If indeed fragments of cartilage have fallen out, or all of them, and the surrounding tissue is soft: then gather the edges of the skin together with sutures over the opening of the gut, and do not touch the gut itself, but rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and discharge it in a few days.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with poultices which have astringency and drying qualities, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If indeed a wound has made an imprint in the bone, then uncover it: then if there are fragments of bone in that place, extract them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound has healed, and the bone has separated and discharged its pus.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If indeed the wound was recent, then powder over it the powder which I have mentioned.</start_of_turn
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If indeed bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn

SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is percussion of a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If any fluid proceeds from the wound when the patient breathes, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not reach great depth, and it is found with its blood: then do not put in it from the first hour any powder, neither string it, lest the blood remain in its depth and be lost, but return to the heart and kill the patient: but put in the wound a strong absorbent, and dress it twice daily.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed the wound is not present at the place, then put in the opening of the wound a thick wool cushion, that it may absorb what proceeds from it from the humilities: and cause the patient to sleep upon the wound, that the blood which is gathered in it may be cured.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed more than three days or more have passed from the wound and the patient has neither spasm nor bad tremor of the heart nor bad constriction of the breath, nor other symptoms: then you know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Care for it also with medicines and with care, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens: then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Care for it from its head to its tail
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or a knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it as for that which has been sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if indeed it has made an imprint in the bone, and there is a fracture from it: then inquire about the wound, and properly remove that fracture, if it is separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated: leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, in order that the extraction of them may be easier
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The remaining wounds of the other members must be judged in their curation.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning the wounds of the belly, the intestines, and the bowels
Caput LXXXVII.	Concerning the wounds of the belly, the intestines, and the bowels
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great one, therefore, whenever the intestines or a number of intestines come out
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, there is an inward displacement of them, and their suture is more arduous and difficult
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption is also difficult in another way
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not promptly restore them to their place after their inward displacement: for they swell, open, and become thickened: and thus their passage becomes difficult
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, therefore, the medium disruption is better: for with it the reduction of the intestines is not difficult, as it is with the great and small disruptions
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of wounds is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common for the suture of the belly, and for the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper for the remaining wounds of the body.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are other two which are more proper for the suture of the belly: and I will narrate both of them with their exposition and their declaration
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when a wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Neither because of the proximity of the disruption [of blood vessels] nor because of the inflation in the intestine due to the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When such things are present, it is necessary to heat it [the affected area], as with oil or to immerse a sponge or bag filled with moist material in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water a little barley, some cypress and saffron, and embrace with them the intestine until the inflation subsides
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When such a drink has been made which has a styptic power: it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the inflation has subsided, then moisten the intestine with the warm water in which it has been boiled, or with vinegar.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For in this way its entrance will be eased with little things.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, its return recurs after this treatment, then one will find a small disruption, with the instrument used to remove hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first treatment is better when it is prepared beforehand than when it is performed hastily: and it does not cause injury to the instrument after it is necessary and defective
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the outer part not be as soft as that of Spatumilis, rather let it be rather blunt: and such is like cheese, as in the drink
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the vessel has been strengthened and the intestine has been introduced, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible: for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the disruption is wide in the lower part of the intestine: then one must make the patient lie on his belly with his head raised higher than his feet.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	If it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head above and its feet below.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	If there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and consideration on this, that the part in which the wound is be above the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	It is like this with great wounds and with medium wounds also
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands, which hold the disruption whole: and join its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it what follows the suture something after something: and this is the manner of common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take the needle, or the number of needles according to the quantity of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of a finger-width, that is, the doctor: and fix the needle once beyond what you introduce into the flesh in two extremities of the skin, when two extremities of the fat are made to penetrate from the other side, and when you have brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fat: and there are four orders
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then draw with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are aggregated by a descent.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go the length of a finger also, and fix in the flesh another needle: afterwards pass the thread back with the needle, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do this until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles of medium size are between the length and the breadth: because the fine needles easily slip through flesh, and the large ones are difficult to pass through the skin: therefore it is necessary that the intermediate sizes be between the length and the breadth.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	It is not permitted for the needle to be placed at the two nearest edges of the skin: lest it slip through the flesh too quickly, and open up a wound before the tissue has solidified, and remain extended even after stitching, thereby hindering the healing of the wound
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the extremities of the needles, so that they do not wound the patient in his sleep: and place upon them little cushions of wool from all around, which hold the extremities of the needles: and let them go, until you know that the wound has solidified
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this is the kind of suture which is most suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For a small wound, one or two needles, or even three or four, suffice
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is that in which the extremities are four in number: two of skin and two of fat in one wound, with a needle through which the thread is passed, equal in length and breadth.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced with the needle the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the thread is taut from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture will be like the stitching of cloth. Place between every suture as much breadth as the little finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture is known to men
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I performed this suture upon a man who had suffered a wound from a knife in his belly, which had been disrupted by the intestines up to the amount of two palms from the middle of the intestines, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	The intestines stood outside the wound for forty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound closed after remaining open for fifteen days: and I cared for it diligently, and it healed: and afterwards it remained closed for many years, in its original position.</start_of_turn>
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians judged that it would not heal.</start_of_turn>
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And indeed, I did not treat it with unguents.</start_of_turn
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where unguents were not to be found, and there were no medicines available.</start_of_turn
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I placed above the wound a bandage of wool twice a day, and I bathed it frequently with warm water until it healed.</start_of_turn
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two other kinds of sutures I shall describe according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is thus that you begin with the acute suture: and you enter the hook from the outside inwards towards the interior.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When you have thus penetrated the skin, and in the tear you have made according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let go of the outer extremity in the side from which you introduced the hook, and make the hook penetrate through the opposite extremity from the inside outwards at the opposite end.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus made the hook penetrate, then make it penetrate once more in the same place outwards from the outside: and let go of the outer extremity which is in this side, and make the hook penetrate through the opposite extremity from the inside outwards at the opposite end. Make it penetrate just as you did when you made the first penetration in the outer extremity which is in this side, until it penetrates through the whole.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then commence also from this side from the same edge, and draw out the same with the extremity which is from the heel to the edge on the other side, and extract the point from the skin which has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then withdraw from that skin and draw out the heel which is on the other side with the edge: and extract that which has penetrated from the skin from that side, and make that part one with this and that: and make this part one after the other until its edge is altogether as in this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of all these sutures is as for the sutures of leather: thus as you draw out one extremity from one part of the skin: and as you let down the other from the other part, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture which Gale has said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the way in which he has said it, that you must join each part according to its likeness, as certain physicians do with some things: and you must apply the heel to its like, and the edge to its like.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you insert the point at the heel close to the outer side, and make that penetrate inwards only in this place: and draw out both extremities of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then withdraw the point and make that penetrate from the outer side inwards through both extremities of the suture, that is to say on each side
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then withdraw both of them, and also make them penetrate both from the inside outwards through the other two edges which are on the opposite side
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this is the best way of stitching which is remembered.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some have said this.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The gut suture is corrected with two squares.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, insert in both guts a single thread: and begin with the needle that is with thee, and make it pass through until it reaches the other side, following the suture that is between the two layers of skin
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	Know that when a disruption is in the middle of the gut: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the gut.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgement of the violent wound is the judgement of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you follow a wound with its blood, before it changes itself by swelling: and you reduce the intestines, and hold them together: then you put over the powdered meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put over it some unguents, which are in your presence, until they make pus: and the thread will fall out, and the wound will be consolidated, and will heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this as for the care of the other wounds, until it is healed
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if there are not present to thee medical men, then put over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, soft cotton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught thee, until it is healed
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For thou shalt not use any other medicine in many cases, when wounds are simple
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however thou fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the lesion: then thou must plunge wool wool of the finest kind into lukewarm oil, or into rose oil: and put it about the parts which are between the buttocks, and under the armpits
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then he must anoint himself with a mixture of wine and black, warm unguents: especially if putrefaction has already penetrated the intestine, and an opening has been made through to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The small intestine, however, which is called Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from the wound which happens to it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their numbers, and because of the subtility of its body, and for the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a clot, and you follow it up, reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines which you equalise
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed it has passed beyond that space, and is black or dark: then it is necessary to tie it up with a thread above the place which has been injured so that the flow of blood does not occur
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a clot there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut through that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to support above its attraction, and extraction of it in the case of a clot, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound which happens in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, in some individuals, that it will heal: because I have seen that which was wounded in the belly with a lance, and which was from the right side of the stomach, and which was old: and a fistula was formed, and it went out of it egestion, and swelling
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I hold fast this treatment until I am relieved from the patient's condition: neither will I cease until he is healed and his place is firmly restored.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	Once I have placed the treatment in its proper position, I fear no harm to the patient, for no harm has befallen him from this treatment.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	I remain in a better state of health, eating and drinking well, fasting and sweating, having bathed, and exercising regularly in my diet
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestines, and it is slight: then it is necessary to bind it in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking large ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join together two lips of the wound, and place an ant on one of those which has an open jaw over the two lips of the wound
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When you have placed the head over them, and tied its jaw, cut off its head, and it will adhere to it, and will not be dissolved.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	And place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this until you have completed the wound to the amount of the entire wound
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	And then draw it down, and close the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	And those heads remain annexed in the intestines, until the intestine is healed, and is not harmful to the patient
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	It is also possible to bind the intestine even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestine of an animal, and is annexed to it when it is introduced into the belly
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And take the extremity of that thread from the intestine, and cut out a great deal of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then the ligament at its extremity is bound by a subtle thread of linen.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the edge, and with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And in this manner of stitching with hooks and intestine, it is not without reason that it should be done with trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that which is great, spacious, especially if it is in a graceful intestine: then it is not wit without subtlety, neither is its healing altogether
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	About the care of ulcers, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every ulcer, or swelling when it grows old and hardens, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not burst: then it is called universally in any part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.</start_of_turn>
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed according to truth a filtered nodulation, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the consistency of a bird's wing feather: and for this reason they call some of them Risati, that is, feathers.</start_of_turn
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes in certain hours it is moist, which emits pus.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it bursts in some hours.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes when this moisture is much, and is little, and is great, and is fine.</start_of_turn
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I say beforehand in the explanation, that every ulcer which does not heal, neither is born in this body, is not that except for one new cause.</start_of_turn
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	When one is in want of life, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because between the two there is a hard substance covering the lips, hindering the birth of flesh: or because there is an abundance of pus and phlegm: or because there is a putrid ulcer in itself, and the matter that issues from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment: or because corruption is falling in the region, being a kind of pestilence: or because of the property of the region itself, as it often happens in Caesarea, where digestion is difficult and healing is delayed after a wound by nature: or because there is only one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	I have also mentioned all these causes and signs, and the cures for them with the doctors in discussion. And it is proper here to tell you the cure for fistula and swelling, which is done by one operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	There are indeed fistulas which arise from great veins and arteries, or nerves, or fat: or from the intestine, or the bladder, or some of the bones: or from some parts of the back, or from some of the joints.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Since these fistulas are of this kind, they are caused by difficult diseases that do not receive treatment, and are accompanied by hardship and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, any fistula does not reach such depths as those which I have mentioned, and if you hope for its recovery and trust its treatment, and wish to recover your health, then attempt to grasp the air or iron if the fistula lies according to its rule, and inquire about it with the thing itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, in the fistula there is tortuousity, then you must investigate the same with a weight that is subtle.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For the weight is gentle of its body, it will flow around the tortuousity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible to do this with the weight alone
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore grasp from the inside out of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture which you grasp will go out through the other openings and run from the inside.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire diligently in what manner it is possible: that you may know whether there is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is of long or short duration: or whether it is a fistula which has many openings and rests upon the whole of it, with the sum of your force: with your interrogation of the patient, and the finding of pain upon compression with your hand in the place, and similar signs and symptoms following
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have rested upon all these things, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence: and it is that you consider then, if the fistula is apparent in a nearby place, or in a remote place from the junction, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have mentioned: then dry up the fistula according to what is said above from the narration, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and corrupt blood, which is born from the opening of it from the flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it is healed
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is according to right angles: then it is necessary that you cut through the depth as much as is possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then remove from it all the corrupt blood from it
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the roundels of lead involved in acute medicine: and introduce them until they reach the depth of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this as many times as necessary, until the acute medicine has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from its corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the cavity with unguents that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it does not heal through this, then cauterize it according to what we have said
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you have confirmed that for me: then inquire about it, and dry it up according to what I have told you: if it does not impede you anything from the bone, or nerve, or major limb, as we have said
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If indeed it is detected that there is bone in it, and there is some corruption and blackness: then burn it, until the corruption of that is completely removed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	Which if it does not heal, and pus is emitted as it did before: then you know that you have not achieved the entire eradication of the corruption
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Investigate further concerning this, and inquire diligently about the reason for it, and the purification of it with your utmost ability.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If indeed it heals, it is good: and if not, then you know that that corruption is in a profound depth of the body, which you have not been able to overcome
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not in your power to do anything in this matter, except to yield to the nature of things.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If indeed the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for that purpose
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then make a strong traction of them all, and do not let anything slip from your hand with your skill.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, there is anything slippery from the humors, and there is no fear in the incision, or error: then incision them humors and flesh, if there are any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to extract the bones from this hour, then place over it something which will putrefy it: and let it go, until it putrefies what is around the bones from flesh and humors
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not swell
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And be careful of the section which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And put over it, if you will, sulfur pounded with oil: or immerse it in Egyptian unguent, or in some other unguents of your choosing.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these humors putrefy, and are separated from the bones, the wound will be soothed by the removal of the pain, and their traction
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If indeed there is a large bone, such as the femur or the tibia, and the like of these, which is corrupted: then take it out cautiously, until the black spot and the corruption are removed
Deinde restaura uulnus.	And then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone: then it is necessary to cut it through, and to open it up to the very place where the corruption is: then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, what happened to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and an aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had moved above the middle of his body inwards, that is, from within, until it reached the leg, and there remained a great swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	The swelling had persisted for a long time with an error of the physicians, until the swelling was opened, and many substances accompanied it.</start_of_turn>
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the dressing was placed, until the leg was bandaged, many holes were made in it: which all discharged pus and moistened the body.</start_of_turn>
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The multitude of physicians treated him for two years, and there was no knowledge in their art concerning this matter until I came, and I saw his leg and the matters which issued from those holes in great quantity: even all the men in the city were astonished, and his color became pale.</start_of_turn>
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	They tried to pierce one of the holes in one place, and the attempt reached the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I inspected all the holes: and I found that they all led inwards from all parts of the leg.</start_of_turn
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I treated it accordingly, and I cauterized one of those holes, until I found a piece of bone: and I found that it was corrupted: for it was rotten, discoloured, putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated even to the marrow.</start_of_turn
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw that which had been detected by me, and prepared from the corrupt bone.</start_of_turn>
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I declared that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption, which I excised and cauterized.</start_of_turn>
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I extirpated it.</start_of_turn
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I order the restoration of the wound along with the physicians who are firm in their space for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And they are not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I will attempt, and I have found above the first detection: and I have found continuous corruption with the bone: and I have seen that even this corruption has appeared from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempt restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I have found thus above it again, and I have not ceased to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt restoration: and it is not restored, until I have cut from the bone almost a palm's breadth, and I have extracted that with its marrow
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and there was no need for this repetition of the operation on it, and the section of it, except because of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, for it was dying in every hour from excessive evacuation of its syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is thus healed completely: and he was born in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned to him: and he conversed with his fellows: and he did not make him lame in walking at all
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to support it, according to this method: that you take a ligament and bind it to the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of a greater size alongside the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the ligament over the flesh, which is upon the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you will discover the flesh over the place where you wish to saw, so that it does not damage the flesh
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: for when you do this, it does not hinder that it will cut through rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	It is necessary that the suture be placed above the corrupted part, so that there is no depression of the corruption: and that it does not appear to the sense, and that it compels the patient to make a new suture
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, continue the part of it with the part itself: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in the part itself: then remove the flesh from all sides entirely
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood under it.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards suture that part first from which the corruption is, until the suture reaches the other part: and let the suture be as far from the corruption as possible, as we said before
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the junction, cut through the corrupted junction and suture the bone where the other part continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then there is no wisdom in it except for abrasion
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then matters are difficult there
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary to inquire what kind of corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade the flesh, and cleanse it as much as possible according to any possibility, and with any ingenuity: when it does not make the vein or nerve worse
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	You know that the saws and the sutures for cutting this bone are many, according to the position of the bones, and the preparation of them, and their length, and their thinness, and their size, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherever necessary, it is appropriate to prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	You also know that these operations are significant in relation to the kind of instrument which is suitable for them, when you have studied for a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of treating diseases: for then you will find for each ailment that which instrument is suitable from among the instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am confirmed in the last chapter of this book concerning the number of instruments, which I have placed as examples of the instruments that you will experience, and the test which you will make on other things.
Forma Serrae.	The Shape of the Scalpel.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The Shape of the other Scalpel
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of the other Scalpel again
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of the other Scalpel once more
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the Scalpel is depicted with the middle part made off-center
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Its arc is on the upper part, the point of its sharpness on the iron: and its handle is of boxwood, and it is made pyramidally off-center
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The Shape of the Scalpel with a Joint.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this Scalpel is in the shape of the head of a star: and its points are in the shape of the points of a fishnet
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable except when it is grasped with the head of the javelin, when the head is broken, or when the bone is fractured, and it is large
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The Shape of the Greater Scalpel.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The Shape of the Middle Scalpel
Forma Rasorii lati.	The Shape of the Broad Scalpel
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the wound in which there is concentration.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the wound is milder in this case.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the wound is more curved at the extremities in this case
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of the wound is small and mild in nature
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the wound as when bones are fractured
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape of the wound is large in this case
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to the radio [radius of a circle], and the extremity is like a saw: it appears in many places because of the reason for the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the wound agrees with the cause of its perforation by bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and the extremity is acute
Fit ex Indi.	It is like that of India
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it should be as it has been said concerning wounds, incisions, and saws in general
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the incision of the extremities, and the closure of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy either from an external cause or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have treated the cause of the corruption with medical remedies, and the corruption does not cease: and if you do not cut away the corruption of the limb, without which recovery will not take place: then you must cut away that limb until the corruption has ceased, so that the sick person may recover from the limb rather than from the limb itself, or from the harmful affection which is greater than the defect of the limb
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this has happened is that the limb is blackened, until it is burnt: or it becomes putrid after blackness: until that putrescence has gone out of the limb until it has reached that which follows the limb, and has spread throughout the body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore when the incision is made, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from a blow of some venomous creatures: such as the scorpion of the sea, and the viper, and the spider, and those of a like nature.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If there is corruption, or the blow is at the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so that it may reach right up to the other hand
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut off the hand from the root of the bone, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it is carried away in the bone of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it occurs in the forearm, then cut off the forearm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption has passed, and you see it round about the elbow: then that is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And as for the treatment of this, the quantity of the remedy is important.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do the same with the foot, when corruption occurs in the finger, then cut off the finger at one of the joints: and if it reaches the heel, then cut off the whole foot
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	And if it reaches the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	And if the corruption has gone above the knee, then it is not in this that the limb is preserved, except for amputation, and leaving the patient to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting off the limb, or preserving it, is that you bind the ligaments below, which you wish to cut: and bind the other ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one ligament downwards: and extend the other ligament upwards
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is torn away
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it occurs, or it returns.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Then it occurs, or it returns. It is necessary that you place all the layers of the membrane around the gut, and do not touch the healthy tissue: and it comes to pass that the sick person's wound is added to, and the swelling is cold.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or put upon it some powder which absorbs blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine until it is completed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind up the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I say to you that this is what happens in my foot, for this is what I say to you.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happens in your foot black, with the soot which is assimilated by the fire: and the corruption first happens in your finger, until it affects the whole foot.</start_of_turn
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Thus did this man recover from his ailment, after he had cut away the corruption which was in the limb with its pain: and he found that the pain had gone away, and the soot had disappeared.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And when some time had passed, the same corruption happened in his thumb.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to recover the uselessness with what I had learned from the physicians after the purification of his body: and the uselessness did not return, but it began to go away in another finger: until the corruption spread to the whole hand.</start_of_turn
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the return of the uselessness: and I was also afraid of the death which would result from the cutting of his hand.</start_of_turn
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the patient was above the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When he had recovered from me, he was brought back to the earth: and he came to me because he wished to, and he struck his hand entirely: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I do not approve of this narration, except as an aid to that which falls from the kind of this illness: and as a sign that signifies, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	About the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with doctors.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When swelling occurs in some limb with carbuncles, and the space of the swelling is prolonged until the collection of pus has taken place: then it is burst, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is ejected, and what remains is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a thin veil: and it does not reach the end of its corruption, neither does it affect the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus, and not a fistula, truly, until its space is prolonged, until corruption affects some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula, or swelling
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you cut away the entire skin as it returns: and especially when it is thin, and done like a veil: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and this does not result in the last consequence of corruption: and if there is hardness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which comes out of it has a foul odor: then blister it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and alum, equal parts, which are gathered in a vessel: and they are boiled over a fire, until the medicine turns red: and then they are applied to the swelling
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from this what you need: dissolve it with water and honey, and instill it with oil into the sinus: and bind up its orifice, and send the medicine in it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with pressure: do this every day until the sinus is healed, and the stench is gone.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is instilled with water of cinnabar, when it is not present with this medicine: then take cinnabar from the wood of the willow, or from the wood of the ilex: and sprinkle it over the water.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then remain quiet, and instill with it until you are confident that the sinus is softened.</start_of_turn
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither the water of cinnabar, then instill it with water and honey, to which something of ground cinnamon has been added.</start_of_turn>
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or instill it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to soften and loosen: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in it.</start_of_turn
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then instill it with something which makes the flesh grow in it.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from alum of diaphanicon: and dissolve it with rosewater and wine of astringency: or instill it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.</start_of_turn
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the catheter for instillation will not pass: then widen it with iron tongs: or put in it a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in castor oil, until it is widened.</start_of_turn
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	If the orifice is large, then join its lips together with sutures and discharge from it the quantity which entered without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	If the orifice discharges pus, it is elevated towards the higher parts: then dry that in the lower place which is in it, so that it flows downwards: for pus, when it is congealed in depth, prevents the generation of flesh in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible to dry the sinus below downwards, then attempt to prepare the limb with the preparation which facilitates the discharge of pus easily as it is prepared
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Attempt to retain nothing of the pus at all in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the edge of the bandage.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the bandage be of such quantity that it makes communication of the entire sinus possible.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then with forceps grasp directly at the orifice of the sinus and widen the opening of the sinus slightly
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the soft tissues above the other bandage, according to the size of the opening: and place it above that in a distant position from the orifice of the sinus, so as to facilitate the discharge of the pus from it: and do not tighten the bandage too much, except after a few days when one has become accustomed to it
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	Whoever is above the orifice of the sinus should constantly move in every hour, so that what is aggregated in it from the pus may be discharged: and you will know whether it is much or little, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this consider again the place of the sinus itself, whether it feels any pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it, or whether there is no swelling in it
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When, therefore, the remedy is extended like this towards the mother of the sinus, then you will know that the sinus is already adhering, or is approaching adherence: then you must solve it in the mane, or on the third day. And when you have solved it, then change the bandage and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	When, however, it [the sinus] comes out from the sinus after a long space of time with a subtle discharge, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, because there are men who are late in the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	When, however, it comes out from the sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	When, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then physicians must join in the care of the patient, for they make the medicine both moist in substance and dry in action: like alum, when it is added in excess.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last of these things which are done for its care, it is, that you take alum and dissolve it with rosewater, and apply it over the old wound equal in amount to its substance
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then join it with this, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the like of this, when there is no alum present, honey, when you dissolve it, until it has solidified, and you apply it with that.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloes, and balsam: mix them all together, and grind it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then apply it over the bandage, and bind it over the sinus: and apply with the honey which you have boiled until it has solidified: and sprinkle over it the powder of these things, and put it over the bandage and bind it again.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	When such a long aristolochia is administered, along with radix lilii coelestis, lilium, herba flour, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	When such long aristolochia is administered, along with radix lilii coelestis, lilium, herba flour, and centaurea, use either simple or compound preparations. Crush the mixture with honey as described previously and use it immediately.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinus persists and does not improve with treatment, you know that there is corruption in its depth: either an impression is made in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or in the ligaments. In such a case, treat the fistula according to what has been stated previously.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of panaritis and the retracted nail, and the addition of incision of the digit and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 101.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a swelling that occurs under the nail of the thumb or toe, or perhaps in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When such a condition persists and is neglected, and the swelling becomes painful, pus is emitted, and the root of the nail is corroded: and perhaps the whole nail is broken, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, which gives off a foul odor: and the digit becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you have treated it as we have said, and the condition does not improve: then it is necessary to cut away the whole remaining part of the nail with a knife
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterization is better with cold.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound and the nail is also sound, and the addition of the nail has caused the flesh to swell inwards and to bleed: then you must place a fine radium under the nail at the angle where it is biting the flesh, and press the nail upwards: and cut away the flesh easily with the knife, and place over it what remains of the flesh which has been burned by the doctors, corrosive, until it has disappeared completely
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away the bone and extract it: for it will not heal while it remains in that corrupted state.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If an ulcer or corruption approaches the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as has been previously mentioned
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, attrition or percussion should occur to the nail, and there is pain in that area, then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part at first
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the wound with a sharp spatula from above downwards to the end.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the incision should reach the flesh under the nail, for you will thereby cause additional pain and a risk of gangrene in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which rests the pain
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which has been added which was born in the hands of men, perhaps is entirely fleshy: perhaps also in some of its bones, and perhaps in that is its nail: and some of them are born in the root of the joint, or is the origin of its nature in some joint of the finger
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some joint of the finger does not move: and he who is born beside the joint of the finger, perhaps moves
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is fleshy from bone, his cutting is easy
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, as you would cut it at the root with a broad spatula
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	As for him whose origin is in the root of the joint, the care of him is difficult
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Caput XCII.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then string the thread of the patient from the upper part of his thigh to the lower part of his knee with oil.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry one, or two, or three sections wide at the place where it is needed
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift up, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the upper part, and from the upper part pour it down as phlebotomies for the patient at first
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the wound until blood stops flowing: until the quantity of blood which you have drawn out is equal to the amount which is sufficient for the patient, and as much as the patient can tolerate of the pain.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie up the wound: and command him to abstain from foods which generate black bile: and repeat the emptying and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this will be good for the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of the limb is done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	The thigh of the patient, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert the limb into a bath: or embroider it in his leg with warm water, until it turns red, and makes the veins swell: or perform an exercise forcefully, if there is no bath for him, until the limb is warmed up
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin along the line of the vein section: or at the end of it at the knee, or at the lower part of it at the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with needles, and remove the vein from all sides, until it appears sensible: and it is at the appearance of it that you know that the blood has returned to its normal colour
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it has gone out of the skin, the blood is like white thread
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce from beneath the edge of the Radium, until it rises up and departs from the skin: suspend it with one finger, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry out the surrounding area near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape away the skin from the upper part of the nail, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise up the skin with the Radium as you did before, and suspend it with another finger, as you did at the beginning
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry out the surrounding area, or the surrounding areas, if necessary
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise up, and cut through the last section at the heel
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull out the skin up to the section that is above it
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have pulled out the skin from the higher section, or from all the sections, until they have all come away: then cut through the skin
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not yield to pulling and raising: then introduce a sharp needle with a strong thread, and bind the skin, and pull it out: or introduce from beneath the edge of the Radium: and move your hand over the whole thing, until it comes away
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Take care not to tear it
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it tears, it will be difficult for you to raise up the skin afterwards, and it will enter through the wound to the bone.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have pulled out the skin completely: then place over the wound a lanolin pad soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it heals
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist which involves parts, and is not as we have described according to the rule: then you must find over the skin all the parts of the twist of that twist.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the part with the hooks until the entire limb has been raised up: and take care at the section above the part that you do not cut through the vein or wound it: for it is difficult to raise or extract the part above.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the wound that heals life itself.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the wounded limb becomes blind
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It has no curvature like the rest of the limbs, neither is it acute at the extremities, so as not to wound the vein: and it is thick and flexible: because if it were slight, it would cut through the vein by its softness: indeed it has such excessive thickness that it is like we have said.</start_of_turn>
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.</start_of_turn>
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in warm lands, like Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry and warm lands, with little humidity, that is, in which no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.</start_of_turn
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the decomposition that occurs under the skin, like that which occurs within the bodies of serpents and worms, and the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the commencement of this vein is that which occurs in the thigh inflammation and swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is to be dried.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein is to be extracted from that place of drying, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When the swelling appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to immerse the finger over the leaden weight, which weighs from a drachma to two drachmas and a nodus: and let go of the suspended lead.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	When anything proceeds from that to the exterior, immerse it in lead and bind it there.</start_of_turn>
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it persists for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and immerse the rest.</start_of_turn>
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	Do not cut through the root before all of it has come out.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts, and enters the flesh: and causes the swelling to become more acute, and gangrene in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently, and extract it slowly, until all of it has come out of the body: and from this vein proceeds in some men as far as the tip of the thumb and the little finger.</start_of_turn>
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And I have seen it happen to me that it has come out whole from the hand of a man who had been bitten for twenty palm-widths.</start_of_turn
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it happens to you in the hour of your treatment: then introduce radium into the cavity of its wound, and perforate the wound with a long needle, as with the body, until all that is in it from the matter be evacuated: and administer antiphlogistic treatment to the place with physicians for a few days.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the aftercare of the wound.</start_of_turn
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.

Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found her arm swollen, and I saw an inflation of pus in the groin of the arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw that there was another inflation going up like a worm, ascending up to his shoulder more quickly than is possible: like silver when it runs from one place to another
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place and settled in the shoulder
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	And after an hour it went round the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	And she told me that it had passed through her whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I am amazed at the speed of its passage from limb to limb
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed I have never seen such an ailment of the eye like this, in the way that it is described above
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Many people suffer from pain that changes from limb to limb: and not from the eyes, as with a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe that this is the case, except perhaps in those instances where women have been afflicted by the swellings of the lower parts of the body: from which it follows that the pain is transferred from one limb to another
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, and in whom the swellings are hidden
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore he has received his cure, and the patient feels this pain: then, if it appears to him through the eye, as we have said, then bind above and below in the same place: and dry above the same, until the swelling is discharged: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then cure him with the evacuation of the body, and with that which drives out the swellings, and carmine them with poultices of rue, and with saffron pills, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The text continues with a section titled "On the Extraction of Arrows.")
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.</start_of_turn>
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are varied according to their kind and the places from which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	There are various kinds of arrows: because some have large cusps and others have small: and some are concave and others are convex
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And those that have tongues
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And those that have stars
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those that are according to the limbs from which they fall are in two ways
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	All limbs are either principal limbs with concavities, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, spleen, and similar structures.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When any limb has fallen into any of these positions and their signs of death appear, as I shall afterwards narrate, it is necessary to remove that arrow from there, for death follows its trajectory in various positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs of distress do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When the arrow has fallen into the brain and has pierced the bone, and has emerged above the brain, these are the signs: because of its impact, there are swelling, bruises, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, and mixture of the senses, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And possibly blood will be expelled from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And possibly speech will be lost, and the voice will be destroyed
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there will be discharge from the wound of a white moisture resembling pus
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there will be discharge from it like the moisture of meat
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear, abstain from treatment and remove the arrow if it does not emerge naturally
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that has fallen into the heart are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And possibly the arrow will move like the beating of a pulse: and blood will flow from the wound black
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following that, there is cold at the extremity, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know therefore that death approaches uncertainly.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	When the arrow wounds the lung, the sign is the bloody foam that comes out of the wound: and the swelling that follows the neck, is raised and changes the colour of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great and high spirit departs: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the chest, that is near the ribs: then there is a great pain in the back with deep breathing: and a movement of all the arms and shoulders
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	If the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps it comes out of the wound with some undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	If the arrow falls into the belly, and it lies there: something of stool or bile or intestine which has been broken comes out of the wound
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is greater over the patient: then you know that it is deadly
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	As for the rest of the members, such as the face, and the neck, and the chest, and the gut, and the hand, and the foot, and the back, and the buttocks, and the hip, and the thigh, and the like of these members, when it does not find the arrow in the artery or the nerve: and there is no venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	I tell you that I have seen many such arrows, so that you may know that there is no hope for your cure.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What is this, because the arrow of care has struck the pupil of his eye in the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no document remained in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from him which had struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find the tip of it in the wood: and it was a great arrow like those of the Turkish archers, with a lead weight, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed therefore, and no evil happened to him in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the Christian's belly.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, which is the one with ears
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	And thus I found it between two ribs: and it was submerged in his belly
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I handled it cautiously with them until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the belly which had struck him in the flank: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	When thirty days had passed from that, and no change had occurred in his condition in regard to the arrow, we considered that the arrow had ceased to exist: so we extracted it from him: and he was healed, and no evil happened to him
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And behold the man to whom the arrow had struck in his back, and the swelling had subsided from him over the arrow.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after seven years he recovered from the arrow which was in the root of his thigh
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And the woman whose arrow had gone into her side had the wound consolidated with a woul [bandage] above it, and the arrow remained inside her: and no alteration was made to its position from its natural disposition, and the woman did not discover any document in relation to any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And the man whose arrow had gone into his face had the wound consolidated with a bandage, and it remained, without causing him much pain: and similar things happened in many cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the King's servant, which had gone into the middle of his nose, and it had bent towards the right side below: and the arrow was entirely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to care for him after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the arrow wound firmly bound tightly
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I questioned him carefully with a gentle touch, and he did not feel any pain: and he himself discovered the puncture and the pain from his right side
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that this was the cause of the puncture by the tip of the arrow
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with a firm plaster in which the painful swelling had arisen, confident that the wound would heal, and that the sign of the arrow would disappear: and it did not happen in a place where the arrow had followed its course
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I remained with the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound consolidated in the meantime: and he felt the arrow on the day that the arrow was extracted from his nose
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I put on him a sharp and corrosive medicine for several days, until it opened: and when I grasped it, I felt the tip of the arrow adhering to the wood
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then did I add in the opening of the wound for the acute physician, until it appeared to us with certainty the extremity of the arrow: and I passed over with it the space of time for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	When the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not obey my orders to come out: then I did not cease to work subtily, and devised means above the ordinary, until I had finished on the following day with forceps which I had made with my own hands, according as the form of the matter would permit, until I had extracted it from the body.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed completely: nothing further was known of it.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of the arrows: so that you may know the rule and the significance of it, that which I have not mentioned
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by narration: neither does this book comprehend them, nor does a prudent artificer compare them with little to much: and with that which is present, he overlooks that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and an new instrument among the descent of things of this art when they arise
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by means of the other part being reversed
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or that is an arrow proceeding in the fleshy part: it is attracted and comes out
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to the outlet within the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you discharge it for a few days, until the flesh that surrounds it has putrefied: and the attraction of it will be alleviated, and its egressio.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And in like manner, if it is found in bone, and does not yield to you at the outlet, then discharge it also for a few days: and do it again every day with attraction and motion, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you at the outlet after days, then you must perforate the entire circumference of the arrow in the bone with a fine thread, until the arrow is enlarged
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the head of the bone, and has already progressed into one of the cavities of the brain, and some of its accidents appear externally: then abstain from the attraction of the arrow, and discharge it, until it is equal to it again after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow persists at the fracture, the death is not prolonged for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the fracture: and remains sick for a few days, and nothing of those accidents happens to it: then proceed to the attraction of the arrow and its extraction
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed firmly, and does not yield to you at the attraction: then administer oil in the circumference of the arrow, as I have said before: then care for the place, until it heals
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow has already vanished from its place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire about it with care.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel pain, then draw out the pain with some instrument which is suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If it is impossible to remove the pain above, because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is no bone, no nerve, nor vessel there: then find above the pain until the wound has become larger, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are any ligaments which hold the flesh fixed in the wound, then release the flesh fixed in the ears from all sides, with all skill which you can, and with ingenuity, if it is not possible to remove the flesh from the fracture of the ears, and to twist the ears, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you make the wound evacuate: and lower the last fragment, so that the arrow does not break, and that its extraction be difficult, and itself.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If it is not possible to remove the pain within an hour, then leave the pain for a few days, until the things which are around it have decayed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the pain: for it will make the flow of blood worse. Then perform what we have said in the chapter about the care of wounds: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.</start_of_turn>
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And perform wisdom in every way that you can in order to facilitate the extraction of the arrow: and be quick, peaceful, or slow, and firm, as I have said.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do the same when you draw out the arrow, so that the sick person is in accordance with the figure, as it was with the arrow itself in the case of the arrow.</start_of_turn
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	How great is the benefit.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If it is not possible to do this, then do what you can according to the figures available.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which goes out from the opposite side, or which proceeds from that to the outside: or it makes a bulge of the extremity of the arrow at the sense of the superior part of the skin close to it, and it lets go what is above: dry it therefore above, and make a section according to the quantity that they grasp in that pair of forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the gut: for itself it becomes easy to go out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it for itself: then draw it out
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then do it again, until it comes out on its own.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow is in the limb, then push it out with that itself
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If indeed the limb is fractured, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into the gut an instrument which is concave, so that the concavity of the instrument is against the concavity of the limb: then push out the gut with that itself.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push out the gut with an instrument that is entering into itself.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow will be released by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if possible
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for the gut as it befits
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the belly-button, or on the side: and that which you touch with your finger is close to it, and it is possible to cut above the gut: then cut above, and burn from the navel, or nerve, and draw out the gut
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then, if the wound is deep, take care of it and keep it clean until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the form of forceps by which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not slip from it
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	There are many kinds of forceps, great, small, medium, according to the quantity of the arrow, the thinness or thickness of the wound, and the constriction of the wound itself
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the hooked implement
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	The shape of the blunt implement
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of the extremity like a radius, so that its entrance into the hooked arrow is alleviated, and it is driven by it
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This extremity of the forceps is hooked like the beak of a bird: so that the entrance of the arrow into itself and the driving force are alleviated
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On Phlebotomy of Veins
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 125
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins which are to be phlebotomized, which abound in the body, are thirty in number.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these there are six in the head: two pulsating veins which are behind the ears, called the Herbae: and two arteries which appear in two temporal regions: and two veins which are in the two tear-ducts of the two eyes, called the Aspicientes: and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and the vein which is at the extremity of the nose
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi which are in the neck
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Of phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Of phlebotomy of the veins which are under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy: for it is necessary for the evacuation of the cephalic phlebotomy towards the gut, the tongue, and the mouth diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the cubit
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	For in these three veins which are phlebotomized in the cubit, phlebotomy is customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by cutting with a curved knife: or by cautery with oil: or by drying with a knife, and this is Alnesil
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, because it agrees with the section
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are wide and narrow kinds according to the breadth of the veins and the tension of them. The form of phlebotomy with the knife is wide, like water
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it agrees with opening wide veins, full, bursting, apparent, large, and those which contain thick blood, turbid
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomus is of smaller width and finer extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of Albucasis.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Basilicae, however, which is one of these three veins of phlebotomy, is an instrument of great value
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the humors which are below the throat and the collar, from that which follows the breast, and the belly: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist because it causes no pain, and is above the vein.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, it err, and the puncture of the phlebotomy adds to it, it will reach the artery, and there will be a flow of blood
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to perform phlebotomy with the phlebotomus which is already punctured: rather let it be dry as with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If indeed it does not appear by a clear sign, then it is necessary to seek it out; and change to another one, or ask for another branch of it: or perform the phlebotomy in another place, such as the elbow
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is itself evident, and is dry with the phlebotomus of Alnesil, as we said before
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to make a phlebotomy of it itself, then it is necessary before the tension of the arm, so that you may reach the place, until you know the place of the pulse
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then take a sign over the place with the nail, afterwards the arm, and dry the vein with a concave section of the phlebotomus, as we said before.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	Take care that the percussion does not fall outside the space of the artery
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	When you draw the string of the ligature and inflation occurs in the place which you marked with the scar, then that inflation is an inflation of an artery: it is therefore necessary.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	When you draw blood at the phlebotomy and it flows like the urine of a child, and it is pale red: then you know that it is from an artery
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Therefore you must take care, and place your finger on the space that is longer, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood is shed (for it is shed in abundance), then tighten the arm and let go of it: and let the patient be still, for fear of movement: and be over his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Do not move him for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however blood is not shed, and you perceive that it is not there at the present time: and that there is no physician present at your moment, then cut the artery if you see it.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities recoil, and blood is shed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of the skin of the buttock, and find the vein: take half of it, and tighten it over the place where the swelling is decreasing, with the ligature and the strings until tomorrow.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is shed, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of him as the one from whom the recollection of the bleeding of the wound is remembered: and the cutting of blood in him is not difficult in many positions, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of tying the artery from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the vein of the buttock.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The vein of the buttock is suitable for phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the branch of the basilica, and the branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above fear of his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If, therefore, he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds a nerve, there occurs in it a stupor, and his healing becomes difficult, and perhaps does not heal at all
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears to be connected with sensation many times
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people, and is slight, and is not seen: then you must know that you must perform the phlebotomy as you would perform the ligation of Alnesil, and divide the nerve with your skill.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	And if there is one between two nerves, then find the one in length
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the nerve of the head
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies, however, of the cephalic nerve are dangerous, because they draw blood from the head, and confer to the eyes ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is proper in this nerve to make the puncture with the needle only, or with the hook of the myrtus: because it is safer for all the nerves, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve under it
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	It is indeed fitting for you to seek out a gentler location with regard to the phlebotomy, and inquire about a place where there is less danger: and it will not harm you, if you do not find it at the first percussion, as you will return over it with the phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Perhaps indeed it will happen in some people when it is not punctured at the first time, but it does not harm them that.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be taken in its performance.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and its accidents require your attention.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	The quality of phlebotomy and its accidents require your attention.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And as for the vein in the cubit, there are three that are useful for phlebotomy, namely the cephalic, the cubital, and the basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And as for phlebotomy at the beginning of spring after fasting, in the summer, and in the autumn and winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	It should be done on the first or third hour after the three hours have passed
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy for ailments does not have a fixed time: but when it is necessary and convenient, day or night, at any hour and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not permitted to perform phlebotomy on children until they are at least fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should it be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor on the elderly who have passed their sixtieth year
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wants to be bled for any reason: it is necessary to clear the intestines beforehand with a laxative, if there is much stool retained in the intestines: so as not to bring about the contamination of the principal parts by the putrefying matter of the intestines.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither should it be performed on a patient who is suffering from acute pain, or who is nauseous or vomiting from drunkenness until these symptoms have subsided from the body
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Neither the sick nor the infirm are immune to hydropathy
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the phlebotomist is laid down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If, therefore, a vein opens from the vein once, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it with another vein under that place slightly, or over it with some restriction: if the place does not recover
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	Which if it recovers, or if the patient becomes faint, then let him go today, or tomorrow: and do not tighten the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps he will then draw out the clot gently.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Do not put in the poultice.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood runs too slowly: and take care that blood does not escape from the vein more than is necessary: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to the rule, and add a little more to the operation
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do it with restriction, before the place recovers: for in many people the place recovers during the operation itself.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that the clot has already gone, then do not repeat over it at all, for it excuses you from that thing
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put over it something of the residue of oil: because it will soothe the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And in the same way administer the residue of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you do in prohibition of the course of the blood: and make them become tyriaca alfarach and sage, when you put one of them over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and resolves when it is gross
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If the large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, it frequently happens, especially to those who are not phlebotomists except in the case of a small opening of the vein, then cleanse the area and place above it a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up: and bind for an hour: because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	It is also necessary to do this after the blood has been drawn from the vein itself, with the addition of its complement, or from another vein.</start_of_turn>
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything black or purulent remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if it does, place above it something of aloe, or myrrh of solutes: or something of the juice of mint, that is, camomile or something similar.</start_of_turn>
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And frequently indeed abscesses and swellings occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place your hand over it [the abscess], then if you feel softness under your compression of it, then that swelling is bad.</start_of_turn
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Because of this, put upon it something of what we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps it will flow from the artery.</start_of_turn>
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster of it with something that has styptic power, that it may stop the bleeding.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue.</start_of_turn
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color of the wine on the blood.</start_of_turn
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then send it away until it becomes red: and in the same way if you see it thick: then send it away until it is thinned: and in the same way if it is acute: until its sharpness is gone.</start_of_turn
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	He who is full, strong, and requires extraction of blood should do so with one, so that the phlebotomy may be extensive: and on him who is bilious should be done contrariwise to him.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	He should withdraw it in veins and make the puncture narrow: and it is better that the puncture be transverse than pointed in phlebotomy
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	This method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from the nerves: and is more laudable and safer than phlebotomy through its width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for those who are accustomed to faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary that before phlebotomy he be given a spoonful of pounded bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or barley, if he is feverish: and let him draw from him from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is pale, then before phlebotomy he should be given bread soaked in honey syrup or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented scented syrup
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope should happen during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary to give in the pot water of meat and fragrant syrup beneath the tongue: and to mix it with caraway and sweet galega and to touch his chest with these: and to do the rest which we said in the chapter on syncope from emesis
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to bring about evacuation of his arm, and to resolve his blood slowly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because of excessive evacuation, and whose temperament is bilious, that he should gradually resolve blood by the amount of his temperament in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to bring about evacuation of his arm, and to resolve his blood slowly, and his body is strong: then let him do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from the body towards the opposite side of that from which it hangs down must do so on the second or third day
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that it allows the diseased hand to be introduced into warm water until the swelling subsides and the joint becomes visible once more.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over itself with a bandage of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy should be performed in a transverse direction gradually, not too deeply or too superficially: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be as high as that which is above the wrist joint
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood is prohibited from flowing out, then put the hand once more into the warm water, and allow the blood to flow in the water until you have achieved your purpose
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in the warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And most of all, the flow of blood in the warm water is to be set in the cold days.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this joint is safer than all the others, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the right hand of Salvius is equal to the treatment of the diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that you bind the hand with the bandage or your own hand after you have introduced the hand into the warm water until the swelling subsides and the joint becomes visible once more, and the patient should be asked to feel whether the pain has disappeared
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomy should be performed transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein completely, it will not cause any harm to him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care not to cut the hand too close to the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under the edge of the nail are nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then again, wet the hand in warm water, and stop the blood flow in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not wet it in warm water, the blood solidifies in the opening of the nail, and is hindered from running.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have drawn out the quantity of blood necessary, then put oil and salt on the nail: so that it does not solidify too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in the same way it is necessary to do with every fractured limb.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The bandage of a left-handed person is: because it is equal to the spleen in respect of ailments: and in like manner do it in the phlebotomy of a right-handed person, as you did in the second [instance] equally
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	As for the phlebotomy of the saphenae, the bandage is for ailments which are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, retention of menses, and kidney disease, and the ulcers of the groin and the ancient ulcers of the knee, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it lets the sick limb go into the warm water: and makes above it friction, until the nails break: and binds above the junction of the limb with a bandage.</start_of_turn>
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the nails are at the heel, appearing beyond the thumb: and they are pulled out from it in the front of the foot near the bones of many bones.</start_of_turn>
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore better in a wider limb, or at the heel in its mass: because it is better and safer.</start_of_turn
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you do the phlebotomy on the front of the foot, then take care of the nerves that are under the nails on the face of the foot.</start_of_turn
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And establish your vein that you are cutting across as if you were making an incision: and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If blood flow is forbidden, then repeat the foot in warm water: and let the blood flow in the body until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist has erred in the first attempt, then repeat with phlebotomy to the upper parts, for the place is safe, and not because of any danger, when you fall from nerves, as we have said
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other foot like the saphenous vein.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	As for the sciatic vein, its place is at the heel from the side of the cubitus.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the remedy for the pain of the ankle when it is because of cold blood is to perform phlebotomy.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it should include a diseased bag, and hurry: and bind the leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel four fingers, with a fine strip: it should not be visible except for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the phlebotomy should be carried out according to whatever method is most suitable to you, or according to the cut: and it is better to make an incision or to cut through the skin
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its place is safer, and in many men it is hidden under the hair
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and do not appear to anyone: then perform phlebotomy on one of its branches, for it is that which appears in the back of the foot, and is under the heel: and cause the blood to flow from it as much as you desire
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then solve the stricture, and place above the site of the phlebotomy the skin, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	The stricture is to be solved, and the skin is to be placed above the site of the phlebotomy, and the place is to be tightened.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Regarding the treatment of the wound, and the quality of the dressing.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn>
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wounds are caused by bones, and by air, and by dirt.</start_of_turn>
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	The treatment of the wound is done in two ways.</start_of_turn
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	By scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is treatment without scarification.</start_of_turn
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this treatment which is without scarification is done in two ways.</start_of_turn
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or with heat.</start_of_turn
Aut est absque igne.	Or without heat.</start_of_turn
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the wounds which are treated with scarification and extraction of blood are in fourteen places of the body.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	These are the wounds which are treated with scarification and extraction of blood: Alnocrati is the most posterior wound of the head: Alkehel is the middle wound of the neck: and the wounds of Alhagdahim are two layers of the neck from two parts together: the wound of menti is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: the wound of two spatulas: the wound of Alachosos is over the end of the tail: and the wounds of two focilia are in the middle of the two arms: and the wounds of two crura: and the wounds of two caudae.</start_of_turn
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And the treatment does not draw out blood from small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this does not cause the emergence of pus like that which happens in phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither is it necessary to administer the cautery with fire, nor without fire in any ailment that arises from excessive swelling, until the entire body be evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	Whenever the need arises on account of an ailment, or by custom, we administer it at the beginning, at the end, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time as required.</start_of_turn>
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For in man, when his blood multiplies excessively in him, until it requires extraction by cautery, it generates in his head a grievous swelling, and pain.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from this is that it appears in his face, head, and neck swelling, redness, and distension.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from this it appears on his face itching, and a rash, and shadows, and dimness in his eyes.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from this it is that the place of the cautery is scraped.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from this it is that his laughter multiplies.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from this it is that the taste of blood appears in his mouth: either the tongue swells and expels blood.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from this it is that his sleep multiplies.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from this it is that he vomits in his sleep blood, redness, and froth, and spots like these.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see any of these things, or even two or three days after the beginning of the month: we then order the cautery to be performed immediately, after two or three hours have passed.</start_of_turn
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The application of the Ventouse of the Neck is: because it itself causes weight in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It should remain in place after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed the Ventouse of the Cephalic Phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to use it on those who are pale-faced or in whom there is discharge from the eyes.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it carries great danger with it.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	It is not permitted to use it on the elderly or in whom there is cold in the head
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	However, if it is used constantly, it will cause a blackening of the face
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary to warn the Ventouse-bearer to remove his hand with the wet hand towards the lower parts, fearing the production of blackness
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The Ventouse or Alkehel is in the place of the phlebotomy of the Vein of the Fusae, and of the phlebotomy of the Basilica, and because of this it causes asma, and constriction of the chest, and splitting of the instruments of the chest, and cough, and distension.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to support the Ventouse of the Alkehel downwards, because if it is placed downwards, it causes stiffness of the heart and stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The Ventouse indeed causes headaches, pains in the head and the temples, swelling, dizziness, perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of the phlebotomy of the Basilica
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary for the Ventouse-bearer to be cautious not to tear the vein with the hand: so that it does not cause the flow of blood to be stopped
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The windbag, however, under the chin, brings the saliva to the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and like these there are other diseases which are in the mouth: and it is in the place of phlebotomy that these are.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The windbag, however, under the chin, brings the saliva to the mouth, and corruption of the gums, which is caused by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The windbag, however, of the two cavities of the jaws, brings the saliva to the mouth, and corruption of the gums, which is caused by reflection and heat: because it attracts blood from all these small veins which are in the flesh: and it attracts these small veins from other large veins which are in them, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary, as regards the main wound, not to make it too deep: because the place is denuded of flesh, and under that are nerves and arteries
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The windbag which fills the cheeks brings haemorrhoids to the anus, and ulcers beneath the lower lip.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary, as regards the main wound, that the windbag should be large and open to the air: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the fine windbags will break: and it is necessary to make a great incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The small windbags of the limbs grow in number: because they draw blood from the whole body, and cause old pains in the bones and marrow, and veins: they provoke menstruation, and cause swelling, and stiffness: and they are in the place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the popliteal region.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body much, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The popliteal windbag is close to the wound of the two veins of the limbs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the veins is such that you should place the full stomach in the first incision, and perform suction with a tempered degree: and do not prolong the position of the stomach, but place it quickly, and move it quickly, so that the humors come to their proper place equally: and do not cease performing this until the place has become red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears: then you should scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has a lean body, little hair and few pores, it is sufficient to make one incision, not more: so as not to ulcerate the place
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the surgeon to make the incision wider, and to deepen it slightly: and to perform the suction gently and quickly, and with little movement of the hand
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is any thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to make two incisions.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first place, open a small opening for the drainage of the blood, and its evacuation: and in the second place, perform a precise incision for the extraction of the thick blood
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is black and fetid, then make a third incision: so as to achieve the end result
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract the blood slowly and little by little, it suffices for us to make one incision only.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract a lot of blood, we will make several incisions
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the end point of the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is necessary to be administered from the oils concerning the position of the veins, and what is the cause of the swelling?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	When the skin is large, hard, and tough, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint with open oils, soothing and resolving: if it is in summer, such as almond oil or olive oil, or sweet fennel oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or ivy: and such like these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is excessive fat that is cold: then use bitter almond oil, or balsam oil, or white oil, or alum oil: and such like these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the wound is full of pus and has many pores, and tough flesh: then it is necessary to prevent the oil from sticking by rubbing, and to wash the wound with rose water, or cold water, or salt water, or cucumber water, or seawater: and such like these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He who has much blood in his wound, wash it with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and such like these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He who has large fat, wash the wound with old wine, or chamomile tea, or alum decoction, or camomile: and such like these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to keep the wound warm in a bath, or in the steam of a bath, for it is better that it be given after the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And let no one sleep after the wound has been dressed
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What should be done so that the wound does not swell, or that a bloodletting should be done before the dressing of the wound?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And afterwards, you must consider in the first place: if the patient is suffering from a choleric Ventosatus or Phlebotomatus, and if their blood has increased in quantity and become inflamed: then you must administer cold, such as a pomegranate seed: and also fennel with vinegar and lettuce, and saffron, and chamomile.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And provide them with cooling food, such as poultry and lean meats, and foods seasoned with rue: and things that are similar to these.</start_of_turn>
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if their complexion is cold, you must give them a drink of honey syrup, or of ale, or of saffron-seed broth: and give them a moderate perfume, which is between vinegar and oil: and it is to be taken sparingly of food.</start_of_turn>
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And provide them with poultry and birds: and fish, that is, small birds: and pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of the day after vomiting and bleeding should be more liquid than food: and it is necessary that it be given in a vessel at some time between sunrise and sunset, or medicine of musk, that is, muskroot, or alum before vomiting, or after: to comfort the principal parts and to temper the blood.</start_of_turn>
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And do not give them warm food in the vessel.</start_of_turn>
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About Ventosatus without scarification.</start_of_turn>
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, those vomiting which are without scarification are those which occur over the spleen, and the loin, and the heel, and over the belly, the navel, and the parts of the kidney: because these parts do not suffer scarification over themselves.</start_of_turn
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	Neither is it necessary to inquire concerning ease, except for an attack from a blood vessel to a limb: as we place Ventosam upon the breasts in the flux of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	Neither is it necessary to cool the member by ice, except for an attack from a blood vessel to a limb: as we place ice upon the belly and the navel
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	The cold itself rarefies the limb, and heats it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the swelling
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys, when it happens in the swelling of the testicles or the bladder.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	The urine itself may open the swelling, or remove the stone from its place
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in like manner it does when it is placed upon the kidney and the spleen in the swelling of the uterus in both places
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These Ventosae are administered with a section only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered filled with lukewarm water in pleuritic ailments: and this is done in order to implement the Ventosa, and that it should be great, only lukewarm water alone, or water in which herbs that agree are boiled
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of the Ventosa administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its size is two open fingers, as we form it: and its quantity in depth is half of a palm: and its side is in the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity of the needle: it is made of air, or citrine, of fine margins, soft, equal, rough: so that it does not harm the limb in its position above it: and there is in its middle a transverse vein of air, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus it is with this great swelling, which is greater than we have mentioned, and somewhat less than before, according to the ailments and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The swelling of children is less severe, while that of young men and robust bodies is greater
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this swelling with fire on a limb is that you must apply it with a cloth soaked in oil rather than with direct fire: and put some salve on the middle of the vein that is in the middle of the swelling, so that the fire is surrounded below the lower part of the swelling, so that it does not burn the body of the patient.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then put on the limb: and the finger should be on the hole which I mentioned, until the swelling is taut: while we are holding, we remove the finger, and the vapor rises from that hole, and the swelling is instantly dissolved
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply the remedy according to its method, and do it again if it does not succeed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In swelling which is administered in the case of pleurisis with water, there is no vein or hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is put only on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the greater the swelling is, the more it can absorb water, the better
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugars are not administered in many places, except in those in which it is not possible to position the swellings because of their proximity, such as the lip and the tongue, and things like that.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things like that.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	The quality of the use of the blood is: as that which comes from bloodsuckers which are in sweet waters, far from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are discharged day and night into sweet water, until the patients are satiated, and nothing remains within them
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated at first with a phlebotomy, and with enema.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the limb of the patient is washed until it is red
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then the dressing is placed over it
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they have been placed in and have fallen, it is possible to suck the place with an enema, that is to say, this is the last treatment: and if not, then take away the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rubbing, and squeezing out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	And if the course of the blood should be prolonged after the sucking of the bloodsuckers, and this is the result of sweating: then pour a bandage into cold water, and place it above, until the sweating ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	And if there is an excess of blood, then sprinkle over it fine charcoal, or alum, or things of that sort from the sponges: until the bleeding ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place over the place means of linen cloths of good quality: and discharge, until the cloths adhere to the place, for the blood will cease to bleed
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the bloodsucking, when it is possible, to change the places.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if bloodsucking is prohibited from suspension, then the place is evacuated with blood recently
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or keep the wound closed in the place, until something comes out of the blood
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are bound, for when they themselves feel something from the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When they wish to fall, powderize above them something from aloe burnt, or salt, or ashes: and they fall immediately.

¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections of the nature of bone fractures, of which some are prerequisites, must be considered before we proceed with the enumeration of fractured members and their various types.
Caput II.	Summary and collection concerning bone fractures are prerequisites before listing the fractured members and their types.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	As the prologue to this chapter states, summaries and chapters are required for the artisan to grasp the true station of these matters: namely, that some are prerequisites and others are added at will
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	When any fracture, dislocation, twist, or fall occurs: then it is necessary at the outset to draw out the blood and resolve the swelling, or both simultaneously: for if nothing else hinders it, such as weakness of spirit, or is due to some other infirmity, or old age, or is the time of the year when heat or cold prevails
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him content himself with his food of bread, cold herbs, and birds' meat, and drink only wine in moderation: and refrain from fat meats and fill himself with food from plants and all other food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until then, when he is secure from the heat of the after-sweat, and no longer has effusion of matter from the limb: then let the infirm person return to his ordinary regimen as before his ailment
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the fractured bone begins to restore itself, then it is necessary that the infirm person should eat nourishing foods in great quantity: such as porridge made from barley cooked with water, rice, heads, feet, beans, eggs, and fish that are fresh; and thick drink, and things of that sort
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen, coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know this, that broken bones, when they are in the veins of those who are in their prime of life, and decrepit, are not able to continue and consolidate according to their natural course, because of the drying up of their members: and they consolidate and continue only from what remains in their extremities, as is the case with the bones of newborn puppies.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Truth to tell, nature adds something like glue to every fractured bone, which is of such thickness as to adhere to and bind it together, until they coalesce into one, and are bound together, until it attains in the end the strength and firmness which it had in the beginning, until it is able to withstand any operations which are done to it: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient nourishing food, in which are contained fat, oil, and thickness, as we have said before.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know this, that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the members: for as the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the head: and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the backbone: and so with all the other limbs they are all different from each other: and I shall speak of the recollection of every kind of fracture which is exposed in its chapter, and which is distinguished from the rest.</start_of_turn>
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The kinds of fracture of a bone are also diverse in themselves.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For example, a fracture is bowed, besides the fact that it happens in the hollow.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture is according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures which are compound, that is, with displacement, such as in a pen, when the knife is adjusted to write.</start_of_turn
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not from the bone itself: and is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and is a slight fracture.</start_of_turn
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	Every species has an inherent faculty, or its own instrument, in restoring itself, according to what its memory recalls of it, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From this it is known that the fracture of a bone is its twisting, and its elevation: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when pressure is applied to it
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore the twisting does not appear in its place, neither is there a sound at the touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor is there any great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is a twisting or a slight fracture. It is not therefore necessary to move the limb with the hand and compress it entirely, but rather to place above it from the physicians whose memory recalls what is suitable for the place: then the stricture will be bound tightly
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	You know that when an arch is bent and broken into two, except for the fragments that happen to be in this place, the whole limb is moved from its place: then you must begin from the current hour to restore it, equating it before the cold swelling sets in.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however swelling sets in, then keep it off for a few days, until the swelling has subsided.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then restore it as well as you can by means of gentleness and skill
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	You know that the restoration of it, and its equating, is easier than that of a bone in which there are fragments.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up according to what your memory recalls of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are fragments in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this limb from two parts, if the hand is involved, or the foot: or with the hand, if it is a small limb: or with two strings, or with thread and the hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb above a level place, according to the natural shape of the limb, until the fractured parts extend: then attempt to restore the limb by all your skill, and according to whatever method you wish in its places: and be cautious according to your strength, lest you cause greater pain or damage through your operation than before, and attempt according to your strength, that you may apply one bone to its fellow, according to the better form.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is proper in this hour that you should attempt and touch the limb itself.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If anything else helps there, make it right, and equal it according to the quantity of your virtue
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	Be cautious of excessive tension and compression, as many marbles do
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Many thus cause it to happen through their operation that the limb becomes swollen or contracted in the limb: as we have seen this from their operations many times
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then join after the equalization, and loosen the operation, and bind up the limb, and rest, and tranquility: and comfort the patient above all
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And keep it quiet, lest he move it in the hours of sleep, and his dream, and his agitation, and his egestion, and all his movements his last effort
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And be cautious lest the position of the limb be the cause of pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	When he feels pain or damage in the position of the limb: then it is proper to change it to another position in which he does not feel pain
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be cautious with that, lest his position be crooked: lest there should be twisting in the limb when restoring it.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The quality of the fracture of a broken limb is such as I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken limbs vary in size and shape, as well as in their magnitude
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Such as the small bones, such as the arm, the finger, the ankle and things of that kind, it is necessary to have soft packing, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	As for the large bones, such as the hip and the thigh, it is necessary to have extensive packing, hard
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide ligament connects the large limb and tightens it from every side of the fracture equally, so that it does not yield
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have evacuated it, take an ointment suitable for this and apply it on the fracture site with a soft cushion.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then bind the ligament above the fracture site with three or four ligatures as necessary for the limb: and tighten your hand together with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then keep it firm above the fracture site, and tighten less than the tension you put on the fracture site itself
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then pull it out along with the ligature from the fracture site gently, and soften the tension gradually until you reach a healthy condition again
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then do the same again, and bind it once more above the fracture site with ligatures
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then keep it firm below the fracture site too
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tying and the softening of the fracture, as we said in the first binding above
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the ligatures a soft cushion, or a cloth, so that the fracture is straightened out if there is a twist in it: and if there is no twist, do not put anything in it
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then apply it over the entire other part.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then apply it over the entire other part immediately, if there is no inflation in the place or a hard swelling.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is inflation or a hard swelling in that area, then put on that which sits upon that swelling and expel the inflation: and leave it off for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then string over that and immediately apply it over the entire other part
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the bandages be of the middle breadth of broad rush, soft, and formed with wisdom: or they may be of wood whence are made sieves, which are made of shoots, or reeds, that is, palm branches or rushes: and let the breadth of every bandage be according to this form and this same figure
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the bandage which is put over the tract should be greater and wider than the rest of the bandages: and the length of the bandage should be according to what is convenient for the limb in relation to its magnitude and thinness
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over the bandages with the other part, according to the first measure which was made.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then secure with thread from the center, according to what we have said concerning the measure: and it is that the measure be greater over the place of fracture: and the greater the distance from the fracture, the smaller the measure
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the thread should be of middle thickness and fineness, and should be of softwood.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the thread is thick, like that which is taken from the intestines of animals, thus it is a great error: for the measure will fall from its quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And the thin thread does not suffice: for you will not achieve the purpose with the measure with that which you wish to achieve
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	It is not proper that there should be less space between two stars than between the finger and the thumb.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is treated by the extremities of the stars after stricture in healthy places: then put under the skin a piece of soft wool, or carded wool, until nothing is pained from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When the fracture is with wound, and the rupture has happened in the skin, I will remind you of this in the second chapter concerning the singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	You know that not every fractured limb must be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For a large limb, it is not proper to bind it with stars above its greatest extent, except after five or seven days, or more, according to your security from the heat of the afterburn
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	This is the way of plastering which the ancient restorers used to put on fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common way of plastering which restores the fracture, convenient for various temperaments, especially women and children: because of this it does not burden the heat or the cold
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	Take from the flourmill, and the barley which hangs in the walls of the mill by the turning of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you add lime with the gypsum. Do not put the confection too thick, neither too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Use it like this.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another way of plastering which restores fracture, dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of meal, laudanum, acacia, enula, mugath: and gum, all of them an amount of X myrrh, and aloes two amounts of V and alethil two hundred parts are boiled together, and pounded, and mixed with the water of alethil: or with gypsum if the complexion of the patient is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, make use of this plaster. For it is of good composition and restores fractured bones quickly, and protects many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plastering which also prevents fractures and dislocations
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Mix together flour, blood, white of eggs, ten myrrh, five aloes, six acacia nuts, and twenty parts of Armenian bole. Dissolve everything together with water, or blood, or vinegar: and apply
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of plastering for joint injuries, and separated bones from their places: it soothes the pain of the accident, and tightens the fractured bone and fracture
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fine wool, soak it in vinegar, and smear it over the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	In this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for the relief of after-pain: and it drives away pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of plastering which restores the fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take ivy leaves and fig leaves of the wild: and grind them both together to make plaster.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Short method of plastering, administered for the restoration of the fractured bone: and when you want the resolution of the after-pain.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of radish, chamomile, violets and barley flour, all of which take up one part: mix them all together and dissolve with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then mix it with humid vinegar water or with water only and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of plastering is stronger for the resolution of the after-pain than the first, when it is necessary to restore the limb after stiffness
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the radix of the elderberry, and of the seed of linseed, and of the ballus, and of the melilot, and of the samsuci, and of the flower of violets, and of chamomile, all together take one part, and dry them all, and mix them with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this according to the warmth of the limb, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that it should be placed upon the fractured limb for the restoration of it, except for a lump made of wax and oil: nothing else. And he says that it should be between the thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, thinks that it is useful to place upon the fractured limb for the restoration of it things which contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olibanum, and the like of these things which we have mentioned
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of the plaster which provides for the lesion and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe of mugwort, and ciceros, and human hair cut off, or feathers of birds, and elderberry, and salt, take equal parts: dry them, and grind them, and mix them together: and make from this plaster
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, according to how much is necessary, that the ligature remain, then dissolve it, for thus you will know then, if it does not happen to the sick man that he feels no pain, neither itching, neither movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If indeed it happens to him in the place of itching or burning, or pain, or swelling: then do it properly, and dissolve it at once, and take away the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a sponge of marine wool, wet: and moisten it with warm water, and bathe with it until the itching ceases, and the pain is gone
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it a layer of wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or oil of roses: and bind upon it once at night, until it is secure from the heat of the apostemate, and rest the swelling of the limb, and relieve its pain.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process with a slight tension, and apply a small plaster: and do not bind it too tightly, but with some space about it, until it is healed
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If the swelling, the redness, the pain, and the heat have passed away, and all the accidents have ceased, and the limb is soft and painless, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning equally
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing has happened to the limb from what we have mentioned, then do not touch it, except after three days, or four, or five, or seven
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the limb has recovered for twenty days in total, according as you have seen from the solution of the limb, as we have mentioned, until when the fracture has healed and the coagulation of the flesh has approached: then add to the tension more than the tension you first put on it: and also add to the swelling of the food that has become frail, according as the memory of it has returned.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If however you see that the fracture has healed in that place, and is stretched more than is necessary: then you know that the nutrition is hindered from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Moisten the limb with lukewarm water at every time that you wash it, and keep it in this way for three days, and relieve the tension a little bit.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this operation the limb will receive nourishment, and will heal quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the rest of the restorers of the fracture of the limb do with other means, when they do not restore it in the first place, according as is necessary, and restore it according to the crookedness, is an error in their operation, and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have operated in this way with them
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I do not know from anywhere what has been done in this matter, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the treatment of an injury to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3: Of the treatment of head injuries
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is what is done by an impact with a weapon: and the impact raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, just as an axe does to a log: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axialis
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the weapon strikes something of the bone, and breaks its face, and does not penetrate to its very end: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	There are two kinds of fractures, or a great one, or a small one
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is what is called contusion, or abrasion: and its cause is an impact with a stone, or a fall from a height, or something similar
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the marrow, which is under the bone: or in the face of the bone: and this is a severe kind of fracture, either great or small
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture is what is called occult within the bone in the thickness of hair: and it is a small fissure, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Capillaris
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from an injury is a fracture which is done by a fall, or by the impact of a stone, or things which make layers of the bone break inwards, and make concavity: like happens with bubbles of air when there is an impact and some of their parts go inwards
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most often it occurs in the heads of moist bones, as in the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And they are all of these kinds of fractures which are separated from the surrounding substance, and I shall return with the reminder of the whole in its place
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their projection above the surface, their tension, and the excision of the corrupt tissue which is above them
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary kind is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, is excised, and is bound over itself with bitumen: for the fracture appears black
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, consider in the first place the signs of the patient: then if you aid from the signs which signify a manifest danger over fear, such as vomiting of cholera, and extension, and loss of consciousness, and swelling, and syncope, and fever, and sudden loss of vision, and redness of the face, and similar things from various accidents, probably will not recover: and if you do not aid from the dangerous signs, and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If he comes to you wounded in the first instance when he is wounded: and it is in the cold days, then it is necessary to learn in the ablation of the bone before the fourteenth day of the month in every disposition
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to prepare to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it is corrupted which is under the bone from the marrow, and these things happen to us.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	And if the fracture of the bone has reached the marrow touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary to cut off the separated part, and the attraction, according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary, when you wish to raise the head of the wounded: to remove above the bone according to whatever method is possible for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what lies above the infirm.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you while detecting the flow of blood from the bone, or a soft swelling: then oppose it with whatever is appropriate.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary, that you fill the place with soaked cloths in wine, and wet plaster: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then commence with the care of the bone, and its elimination.</start_of_turn>
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is that you cut the bone with a straight chisel: and this is its form.</start_of_turn
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	The other method is that you administer another chisel after the first one is broader: and this is its form.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another chisel which is broader than the previous.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have at your disposal a number of different chisels: some of which are broader than others, and some are shorter than others: and they are of iron or steel: and use them with ease in striking over the chisel, so that you do not break the head and damage it.</start_of_turn
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before you administer the chisels, with needles which are called non-penetrating needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate the end of the bone which is under the acute angle of the head: because the needle is a rounded extremity above that, which is under the acute angle of the head, like the margin, and a small circle prevents its submerging, and penetrating the thickness of the bone.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take from these bones a great number, of which each one corresponds in quantity to the thickness of the bone until the present time that you have reached the whole skull: concerning whose extremity the acute quantity is in length and breadth according to the quantity of the thickness of that bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	This is the form of the three shapes of bones, or trepanae
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around the fractured bone is this: that you place the bone above the bone and move it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the bone to another place and put what is between every hole the quantity of the thickness of the radius, or around that
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors that are between every hole in the bone: and make that one finer than the thickness of the bone from the edge of the wound, as we have said, until you have fractured the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have prepared for this purpose: such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take heed of every caution, that you do not touch the bone, or any instrument of incision from the gut.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with drilling and it is separated from the gut, if it is continuous with it, you must extract it, and you must ligate and equal the extremity that remains in the bone with another instrument like the incisor
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	But it is necessary that it be thin and fine like other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything small remains of the bones, and fragments: then grasp them with ease with what is at your hand from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after this with sutures, and bandages as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, above all that which is long from fear: as Galen has said and praised highly.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary at first to remove any part of the bone from the place where the fracture is greatest and most evident: until such time as you have removed that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lens-shaped incision which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	The lens-shaped piece does not cut anything: and the acute part of it is wide on two sides of it like water: so that the lens-shaped piece is closely applied to the sac, with the acute part of it facing the bone
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then pierce through the incision with a small hammer until you have cut through the whole bone easily as it is turned: and you will be secure from the nail, which does not happen in this accident which you fear above all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant of this, or is asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the nail in some place, he will cut it away from that with the extremity of the lens-shaped incision itself, and will liberate it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is liberated from that without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the nail, and that which is detached from the bone is its face, and remains in the same roughness and slight inequalities: then it is necessary to smooth that roughness, and to remove those inequalities with fine rasps of various quantities, so that it is possible to administer from them in every place more conveniently, and more accurately, according to that which leads you in the operation, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	You must also administer in the ratio of one to four the larger of these raspers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer rasp after the larger one
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	Do not cease to do this until you have reached the point of administering the thinner and finer rasps together.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every other case, when there are remaining small hair-fissures and a fracture of the finer kind, you must take care, according to the nature of the matter, to restore it to its normal position
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	For all this is not hidden from anyone who has studied in this art, and it stands in the writings that we have mentioned before, and we have set it down in the fractures of great magnitude
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a bubble of pus is found adhering to the bone when you are rasping the bone: then you must take hold of the bubble of pus, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another bubble, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first bubble: and do this until the pus is made soft and does not ooze
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it a broad ligament: and do not tighten it, except for the quantity which is sufficient to hold the wound only: and remove it on the first or second day, when you are certain that the wound is healed from the heat
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then wash it and administer afterwards these medicines which are useful for excess dryness: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herbs, and the dust of thorns, and marjoram, and similar things: and make from these medicines a powder, which you will sprinkle over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	Everywhere he [the surgeon] administers, let him use every kind of medicine which has the property of drawing out [the foreign body] without biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	Beware according to your skill, so that your instrument may be limp and flexible in your handling: neither greasy nor biting shall it be
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let you permit the application of any viscous or oily substance in all this: for when such a substance is applied to the head of a wound, it corrupts the matter, brings about its corruption, and increases the danger in the diseased part. In like manner, if you do not take care of its treatment, black spots appear on the head of the wound, when the bone is exposed by the dressing.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, if you happen to encounter such accidents as we have mentioned, you know that it is dangerous to delay treatment
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if no black spot appears, except that which is caused by the medicine which is applied to it, and it is in the skill of that medicine, then you must take from the honey one part and from the rose-water three parts, and mix them with the dressing.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then apply it to the wound: afterwards take care of it with the methods which are appropriate to the case, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured
Caput IIII.	(The text provided does not include the content of Chapter III, so I am unable to translate it.)
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts simultaneously, or one of them: because they are two bones. For the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, neither does it happen to it except for attrition, twisting and bending
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then you must introduce the little finger into the nose, and equal the fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with skill and ease
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	Neither let the operation be performed too closely upon a sickly person suffering great pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach the nail: then it is necessary that the breadth of the limb should be equalised in that part where the thickness is small.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If however the fracture is in two parts: then do like that: and keep it equal with restoration on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not: then after the seventh or tenth day from the commencement of the pain.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the limb of the nose a bandage of linen, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two bandages if the fracture is in two parts: and let the thickness of the bandage be such as to close the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers say that they are to be infused with butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	This however does not seem to me to be good; it is better that the bandage be infused with alum and powdered meal
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the bandage when the bone has become firm, and apply cartilage
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When however it is introduced into the nose in the place of the bandage a pen of lead is to be placed over it, after it has been covered with soft tissue: and let the pen hold the fracture of the nose more firmly, and that it does not prevent the sickly one from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you will: do so. And if you will not: do the bandages
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If indeed it happens that the nose is again struck while you are working on the after-burn: plaster the nose with lead, or with fat burnt in oil, or mix some of the above with vinegar
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the callous swelling does not subside, then it is necessary to pack it with barley flour and coarse powder of barley with alum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place over it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose with anything whatsoever.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are fractured in a small part, or are split, then it is necessary to break through above them and extract them with the instruments that are suitable for that purpose
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut through, and care for it with that which nourishes, and consolidate with suitable dressings or unguents.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If there be between the nose and the eye a swelling, then it is necessary to care for it with astringents. And give antimony until healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is disrupted.
Caput V.	Chapter V
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is disrupted and its fracture is not associated with a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only lateral and not divided into two parts, and it is healed inwards: then its knowledge is easy
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the left index finger into the fracture: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the right index finger: and press with it the prominence of the fracture inwards towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and with this to equalize it
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an expansion between the two parts, according to the rule of rectitude: until it is possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, swelling should occur in the teeth, either from commotion or rupture: then bind those from which you hope that some remains with gold, thread or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place upon the fractured jaw a bandage.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place upon it a doubled pad, and place upon the pad a large sponge which is hollowed out in the middle: or an equal piece of leather which is split in the length of the jaw.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it up above, according to how it is prepared for this ligation, and apply it itself conveniently: until it is not broken: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him soft food.</start_of_turn>
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something has altered in some way: then expedite matters, and solve it on the third day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered from that, and cover it with fine powder, with alum or with oatmeal, after you have removed the bandage: and place upon the covering soft wool.</start_of_turn
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore that plaster remains attached to that, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, let it go, lest you break it: or bind the fracture.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Many times this fracture is bound for three weeks.</start_of_turn>
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime swelling occurs which is cold: then manage this as we have said many times in its sedation, until that swelling is removed.</start_of_turn
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.</start_of_turn
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if it is separated from the bone fragment, or from the dressing: then take care of this, so that you do not increase the fracture with that which agrees with you in the ablation of them.</start_of_turn
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is strict, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	When you have removed the blood clot, and nothing remains of the clot, then enlarge the wound if it is large: and if it is not large, place over it patches which fit to it, and hold them in place until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the fractured bone.</start_of_turn>
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.</start_of_turn>
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furcula most frequently fractures from the front part towards the part of the humerus, and the fracture of it is done in one of three ways.</start_of_turn
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it simply fractures and separates into two parts, besides which there is blood clot: and this is easier for its restoration.</start_of_turn
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, that there is blood clot in the bone: and this is more difficult for its restoration.</start_of_turn
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, that it is fractured with a wound.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without wound, is that you make two assistants present, one of whom follows the fractured Furcula, and the other extends the limb above the part.</start_of_turn
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of the fingers, until it has the proper form, according to what is necessary: and let it not be prominent, nor hollow.</start_of_turn
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If indeed extension causes more distress, then it is necessary to place under the limb of the patient a ball of wool, or a lancet: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of necessity. And extend and elevate the Furcula, and bandage the ball of wool, until the fracture is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If the bone of the Furcula will not be drawn out to the exterior, because it has gone deep: then it must be that the patient must lie upon his belly. And you must place under the arm of the patient the middle finger of your hand in size, and bring your minister of the humerus down to the lower parts, until the bone of the Furcula which is in the depth has risen up to the surface. And then you must straighten the fracture and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a swelling from the Furcula, and it moves: then it must be that you must find above that and draw it out easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is retained in the bone, then you must make an incision in it with one of your incisors which you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the Furcula an instrument which will hold the soft parts: and the instrument is of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a spiral which has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to that which you must digest from the magnitude of the bone, and its thickness
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also according to that which is possible for you to do in the operation
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities, like a bow: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the rupture of the skin which you cut when you drew out the swelling of the bone is wide, and you secure it with a warm pack: then you must join together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or times there is a warm swelling: then you must close the wound with a bandage, and with stitches according to the quantity of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If the abscess is hard, then pour oil into the hollow rosate, and aceto, and wine, and place on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	If the abscess is without wound and without incision, then place on the bone a plaster made from flour and alum
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft cushion over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under its head if it is painful.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take hold of the heel, which is, the part which the Saracens grasp, which is long like the palm of one hand, or more or less like that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a doubled towel over the cushion and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a needle from a thin board, whose width is like three fingers, and as long as that.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then pass the needle through the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then pass oil with the needle in the place where it rests on the fracture and the place
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the fractured part over the fracture so as to turn it, and pass the needle over the healthy side and under the fractured side: and reduce the oil over all parts, as much as the tension of the fracture allows: and that which does not appear outside, and the whole, so that the needle does not slip from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to keep the wound moist every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Every time, therefore, that the ligament is softened, and the needle is removed: then rectify it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient to sleep on his back, and place under his head in the night a few small cushions to support his side
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the furculae is raised by elevation of the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the collar of the same: and do not loosen the ligament unless it happens in the place of its accident from itching, or from an abscess, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its face towards that side
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And give support in bending, and let it go, until it recovers and coagulates
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the furculae is bound up and comforted according to many in eighty days: and sometimes in some people in less time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	About the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the scapula fracture, and in its broad place: and they do not fracture from it except for the margins of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it fractures in that place, and fractures in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then try to prepare it according to the figure of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it above the natural figure in every way of ingenuity, which is possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put upon the place flour of barley with alum, and lint, and put on top a little bit of cloth from a doubled sheet
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on the place a broad bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the scapula whole, or a little more
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the bandage is a concavity in some place of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with lint, until the bandage descends according to equality
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind tightly above with the alhimate, of moderate constriction and firm support, until it returns to its proper place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	Consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligament is softened, bind it and keep the swelling in check if it moves from its place: and let the patient rest on the sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	The spatula will be restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this time has elapsed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from the bones that the common union is made, and from them it is not easily severed
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If indeed it proceeds from a broken bone, and projects under the skin: then cut over it and remove it.</start_of_turn>
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said concerning the fracture of the collarbone from the swelling of the after-pulse, if anything like that should happen.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the restoration of a fractured breastbone.</start_of_turn>
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare.</start_of_turn
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are most often fractured, and break from its accidents.</start_of_turn
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and if there is pain, unease in swallowing, and difficulty in breathing: and perhaps vomiting blood, and the fracture is evident, not hidden from sense, the restoration is that the patient lies on his back: and place two spatulas between his thumbs.</start_of_turn
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then first of all touch the humerus of it, and join the ribs from two parts or sides with the hands: and subtilize in its proportion, according to every possible way and as it seems convenient, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a plaster and bandage, and place above it a sliver of lead from a thin board of salt, or chalk, or like lead in lightness, after you have bound up the part in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then subtilize in ligating the part above the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and guard with ligature according to the roundness to the back, and string it with a good stitch.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligature at every hour, and whenever it is softened, string the part: and if its necessity shows itself at the solution of it at the wound, or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or swelling: then take care of it, and solve the part, and remove the plaster, and restore what has happened in the way of its treatment
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you are able to do so to the face: and bind it with a tight bandage, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	As for the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	The provided text does not include the content of Chapter IX, so I am unable to translate that section.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the ribs does not happen except in great places following the back, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen that the ribs are fractured except by violence, because they are cartilaginous
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense when it is inquired of with the fingers
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that it equals the fracture with the fingers according to every possible way, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plaster, and bind the broken bone with an awl if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	If the fracture of the ribs is towards the inside: then it happens to the sickly man a severe pain and swelling, and a puncture, like that which happens to him who has pleurisis: because the bone pierces the lung, and also to him happens difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were skilled in these things with many skills: and among them are some who say that you should put on the patient's body things which generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, extends, and drives the fracture outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abhor that it should be the cause of making the abscess soft, if this does not happen
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if this does happen, then it is added to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them say: put on the place of swelling a soft dressing, then bandage it with force, and this is similar to reasoning
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But indeed they fear that it attracts excessive swelling to the place, because of the disposition of the fracture.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them say: it is necessary that the place should cooperate with the bandage which is already submerged in hot plaster: and put in wool between the ribs until it is fixed: so that there is an even ligation when you wrap it around according to the roundness
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then care for the patient with the cure of pleurisis from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	And if you bind the patient tightly because he cannot tolerate it, and the bone pierces the lung with a painful puncture, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary that we split open the place and remove the fractured rib
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place above it the instrument which conserves the moisture, whose remembrance precedes: and we will penetrate the bone with ease, and we will penetrate it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will add two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and we will care for it with patches, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a hard swelling occurs, then we will make it straight, and we will infuse sponges into the softened gum, and we will place upon the place: and we will care for the patient with what is suitable for the swelling.</start_of_turn>
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And also during the night the patient rests upon the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.</start_of_turn
Caput X.	Chapter X.</start_of_turn>
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck sometimes suffer fracture, and rarely is there any abrasion: and in the same way the vertebrae of the spine also.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to anyone, and you do not know whether he is healed or not: then stay still.</start_of_turn
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you move his hand, even if it is softened, and puffed up, and dead: and you cannot move it easily, neither extend it easily, nor constrict it easily: and when you constrict it with your fingers and pinches it with a needle, he does not feel any pain, neither does he feel any suffering: then you know that he is not healed, and that it is fatal in many situations.</start_of_turn
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves it and feels in it a constriction with the fingers and a puncture: then you know that the bone is healed, and that the patient will be healed with care.</start_of_turn
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it be that Spondilibus dorsi suffer like this, and thou desire to know whether he is well or not: then consider his feet: for if thou seest that his feet are softened, it is like that which happens in the hands: then, when he lies upon his back, there issueth a discharge of wind and evacuation without his will: and when he lies upon his belly, there issueth an evacuation without his will: and when he lies upon his back and would wish to speak, and is unable: then know that it is deadly.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	If it be that Spondilibus dorsi suffer like this, and thou desirest to know whether he is well or not: then consider his feet: for if thou seest that his feet are softened, it is like that which happens in the hands: then, when he lies upon his back, there issueth a discharge of wind and evacuation without his will: and when he lies upon his belly, there issueth an evacuation without his will: and when he lies upon his back and would wish to speak, and is unable: then know that it is deadly.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing else happens to him from this, things are easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of him which happens from this is as follows: you give him a warm pack to the back: thus, as you put on Spondilem a little oil of roses alone: or with some wool or fat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on him again at every hour in the day, until when the back is healed: then put on over one of his beds some soft cushion or blanket, and bind up over him with a bandage: and command the patient to rest quietly and peacefully
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Neither let him sleep upon the part which is suffering from the pain, until he is healed
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it be that at the attrition of the sathaya bone, or that something is separated from it: then it is necessary to cut through the skin, and bring out the diseased part.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is great, with a suture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with anyone who is in the body, from the unguents until they are healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the heel bone is fractured, and the end of the bone is towards the heel: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the hole, and to make equal the fractured bone to the other side, as much as possible, and in accordance with the proportion.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on top of it, and lift it up: and care for the wound with the care that went before, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the ankle
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the ankle fractured
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not except for a break in the extremities: and they are split along their length, and lean inwards: and this causes pain in the place, and swelling: and the leg that is fractured becomes stiff
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as it is in figure
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities: then make equal the fracture according to what is prepared from the proportion, until the figure of it is equal to its natural figure
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is along its length, or leans inwards: then make the sick person lie upon his belly, until the restoration of the fracture is prepared
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal: put on top of it a dressing: then put on top of it a bandage of wood, or of leather: and bind tightly over it what you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, and the removal of the bandage
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equal breadth was made for them with that which was placed before them, until it grasped them firmly according to their equality: and it was prescribed to the sick man, that he should sleep upon his back, or upon his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a cold abscess should arise: then cease from the extension of the limb, and restore it, until the abscess is settled: and place upon it what has settled before it, according as it has been said before, then restore it to its former state: and bind it as seems necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed it happened in the sitting bone, or was fractured, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is therefore fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of them is: take a flat board of medium thickness, according to this form which follows
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind at the two extremities two ligatures.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick man sits down
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his fractured arm over the board, until it reaches its elbow, in which there is the attached piece of the bone
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend from above something heavy, so that it extends the limb downwards
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor will stabilize the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is restored, as seems necessary
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is that the sick man should lie on his chest: and suspend his limb from his neck with a ligament
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one above the fracture with their hands: and let the other hold below it, and extend each of them to their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	Or if desired, for greater extension, then bind under the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament: and extend each of them by both assistants to their two parts.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If, however, the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to place one ligament under the olecranon and the other under the fracture beyond the cubit.</start_of_turn
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	Similarly, if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary to place a ligament above the place of the fracture and above the forearm itself.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then keep the fracture still with ease without labor, until the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply a good dressing: then bind it if swelling does not occur after warmth.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however swelling does occur, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.</start_of_turn>
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place above it a dry bandage soaked in vinegar in aceto and rose oil, until the swelling subsides: then bind it. And the way to bind it is to place a plaster over the fracture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a covering of new cloth over the plaster.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then support the arm over the assistant, and place your hand open over your shoulder.</start_of_turn
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a bandage, and bind over the assistant's arm, so that the arm rests in the place of the bones of the fracture: if it does not hinder you from anything, do not move anything over it from the fracture.</start_of_turn
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If at any time, while another has something fractured from his bone protruding over thee, then use a sponge: for it is, that thou shalt place over the fracture a sponge which is broader and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And thou shalt place between every sponge a breadth equal to a finger: and the length of the sponges shall be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the sponges as I said at the beginning of the chapter
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that thy binding over the fracture be stricter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is elongated, the less strict the binding shall be
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore thou hast aided the position of the sponges and the binding, as we have said, when thou dost restore the limb at the hour when it is restored, then do: and if at any time thou seest a swelling, then loosen the binding and the sponges until the seventh day, as we have said
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, that it may not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or be hindered from nourishing the limb by the disposition of the excessive binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Thus do all things, according as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however thou art in great doubt, that nothing worse may happen: then do not loosen the ligament, except after three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep with his head on his chest, and his hand on his stomach: and place under his support a full bladder of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night, or day, that the fractured limb be not deformed, or the ligament be not relaxed
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Thus do all things with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order we have given, so that the food is soft in the beginning, until the os begins to string: then it is necessary that you digest the food of the patient.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	And concerning the custom of the attendant and the limb, it is necessary that it be bound in forty days: then it is necessary that it be dissolved, and a bath should be administered, and medication with unguents which rectify that
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture be a sprain or bruise: then do not dissolve it from the ligament and the bones until the fiftieth day, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.</start_of_turn>
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are named two epicondyles.</start_of_turn>
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the ulna: and that which follows the thumb.</start_of_turn
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the radius, which is placed under the ulna from the lower part.</start_of_turn
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the fracture occurs only of the greater bone, or only of the ulna: or perhaps both together.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the fracture occurs of the upper ulna, then the restoration of that is easy, and its healing is more favorable.</start_of_turn
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the fracture occurs of the lower bone, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.</start_of_turn
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured together.</start_of_turn
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the upper ulna, then the physician will agree concerning the restoration of that, that he put the thumb in extension with ease, until it is equal to itself.</start_of_turn
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed a large wound exists: then it is necessary that a stronger suture be placed above.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that the figure of the hand be placed at restoration of the limb, and its extension be extended above the wound.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb be placed above the rest of the fingers: and let the lower joint be placed over all the fingers, or over the rest: and let the limb be sitting square upon itself, and let the wound be facing outwards, or in a straight line, in height, so that the limb does not suffer from work
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the limb from the lower part, or the hand itself, or with the ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb extends in like manner
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician must equalize the bone, until it is reduced to a better shape than possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	And if there are gaps in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their place with your art
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed in this appears a separated fragment, and it has burst the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the method which we mentioned before
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I make of this a single head, so take care of it from this moment on
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If indeed at the beginning of your restoration you encounter a hard swelling, then draw the skin with silk thread, white and strong, and let the middle be between thickness and fineness: and tie the thread over it with a fine suture, until the swelling has subsided: then remove the silk and put on a prepared dressing of pounded powder with albumin or glue
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	And put sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture itself be wider and stronger
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know this, that the number of bones in the Brachii arm is six in various positions: whether there be a fracture in one cavity or in two cavities simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then you shall place your bandage firmly over the stronger and more prominent part of the fracture, and somewhat more above the fracture or below it: or you shall place a softer bandage under the former bandage, as the case may be according to the recollection of the matter at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, moist: and not hard, rough ones
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread which is taken from its own line, medium between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens which requires rectification, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until the itching ceases, and loosen the limb, until the itching ceases, then repeat the bandage
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has been softened, and the bone has been removed, and things are similar to these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nutrition is hindered from reaching the limb by the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until the nutrition has returned to it, and then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if no other illness happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to dissolve it, except after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient is suspended at the level of his collarbone.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his collarbone be equal, and his skill be guarded from disturbing movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep upon his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture will restore itself in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the arrangements of temperaments, and the arrangements of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the bones of the hand, and of the joints of the fingers, are rarely found
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And do not happen to them except from great attrition
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, such a fracture happens to the limb, or to the attrition: then it is necessary that the patient should sit with his buttocks raised up: and let him sit with his face towards the side which is equal
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	And then put his hand upon his extended back
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	And extend the fractured bones gently, and keep them even with the hand of the doctor, until they are reunited in a good union
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a bandage and a support, if the swelling does not subside.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	And put a support above according to the quantity of the place: and I have bound up the hand in linen cloth
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is at the lower part almost round about the limb, then make like a sphere from the cloth: and command the patient to rest with his fractured limb resting upon his buttock: and bind it round with a long cloth
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the support be from leather, in which there is softness, so that it may be applied to the skin along with the limb: and bind the hand according to what is necessary
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is towards the outside, then it is necessary: that you place a bandage above and a bandage below in the sole: and keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a dressing, as it is bent: and extend between the fingers with the ligament
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If it happens that the fracture be of any joint of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it must be equal in proportion as it is necessary
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bandage with the sole: and if you bind too tightly, place upon it a bandage straight and firm: that the fracture be elevated and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, as the middle, and index, or ring, and little, then it must be equal, and it must be bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or they must all be bound according to the continuation: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place upon it a supporting bandage firm, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in the restoration of the hand, and after the setting has been done, a warm compress: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens of the like, according as its narration is repeated
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	(The provided text does not include any information regarding the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone, so I am unable to translate that portion.)
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The thigh bone is frequently fractured, and it is declared by sense: because it curves towards the interior and the exterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in this way, that it is bound with a ligament above the fracture, and a ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the limb is supported over its face
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around the part according to equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is close to the root of the coxal bone, then let there be a ligament to the part above, so that the extension may fall upwards: and another ligament under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if there is a fracture close to the knee, then let there be a ligament close to the knee, so that the extension may be towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician must stabilize the two bones with his hands until he has reduced it according to the natural shape: and he must join the bones together with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to place a dressing and a bandage, if the limb is not otherwise stable.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens that the limb is unstable: then let it be rested for a few days, until the swelling subsides, and then return to your care
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage must be tight enough.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover the fracture with a firm bandage, that is, a bandage: and two layers of wool, or three: and let remain from this excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the thigh, until the heel reaches the root of the nail
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And pass a long thread between the coxal bone and the thigh near the knee, and bring the extremities of the thread from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the thigh and the coxal bone from the excess from the rest
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put upon the coxal bone in the place of the fracture some sponges, and put upon it from above a single sponge on the bone of the thigh
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the cavity between the thigh and the coxal bone with wool and linen cloth, so as to equalize the tension
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four windings
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	The more you prolong the ligature at the fracture site, the stricter, harsher, and more severe it will be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then you must draw the two extremities of the thread through to the inside between the hip and the thigh bone
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind it with three nails as well above
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then loop the thread with two extremities downwards until you reach the ankle bone.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have drawn through both extremities of the nails from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip out of place
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tension above it, while it remains, so that no break, swelling, or puffing occurs, or anything like that.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	For if anything like that happens
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then do it properly with its solution and correct what happened before, as we said many times before
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a piece of bone that is protruding from the bone: then it is necessary to remove it, if possible
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on it, and remove it: and care for it as before, until the healing is complete.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	When this fracture of the hip is sutured, besides the nails which are added, do as we said in the treatise on the arm and the thigh
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But in restoring it thus the fracture will not be cured.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if only one leg is restored, besides the other leg which is applied, then it is necessary that the lame leg should always limp
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the hip is sutured in fifty days, or added a little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the diversity of complexions and the remaining provisions
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fracture of the Rotula genu.
Caput XVI.	On the restoration of a fracture of the knee-cap
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that fractures of the knee-cap are rare, but they do occur frequently.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If it does occur, then it is not without fracture or hole in its parts
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with wound and without wound
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	The condition is complete with sensation
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	The restoration of it is thus, that it be made equal to what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is reunited and joined together as much as possible according to proportion and ease, and fabrication
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on a dressing of pounded wheat or barley flour with albumin, or oil: and put on above it a round plaster, if necessary: and bind up above it a suitable bandage to that effect
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Consider all the arrangements which we have narrated in other fractures: thus as cooling the swelling, and the like: so that you oppose all accidents with that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the shinbone.
Caput XVII.	You know that fractures of the shinbone are very serious and that their restoration requires great care and attention.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the shinbone is composed of two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it occurs with both kinds of fracture as that which occurs with two bones of the forearm: and because of this its restoration is equal to that of the forearm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the Cruris is inclined towards all parts
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If a bone is fractured more subtly, the heel is turned towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If a bone is fractured more coarsely, it is found lower down: and it is from that which does not cover the limb.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equality, and ligation of the bones according to that which is equal
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	But it is necessary to know, if the fracture of the heel is a fracture of the bone with many segments: so that the extension be less and the alleviation softer for you
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the heel there is something from the operation which is over the arm: that is, when you equal the bones and complete all your operation, then take two boards of pine, which are administered in the making of sandals which are put under the boards: and they are made from the nails of the palm. Choose from those which have a small thickness, and that they be not from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the heel from the knee downwards
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then cover over one end and a half with two coverings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the heel from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee downwards to the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then ligate two bands in three places from two extremities and the middle
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the limb is rigid, the heel inclines to the right and left, and stands in a good position
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed an ointment is administered from wood according to the length of the heel, and it is placed in the heel, so as to keep it still
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most of all it is necessary, so that you make the limb whole when it is wounded like this
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Consider the crura every day, and study them with the utmost care from the apostemate, or inflation, or from any other cause.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything happens to them, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the foot and fingers
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The calcaneus (heel bone) does not usually fracture completely
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes fracture when the fracture of the heel bone occurs, and the fingers are rarely fractured: and they do not fracture except when there is attrition in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture, and the blood flows between them, then put a bandage on the foot and elevate it above the level of the heart. Prepare the ground under the foot like that of a walker
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stay still, and place your foot on that which is elevated from the bones: afterwards press, or put on a boot: and keep it equal, until it returns to its place
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a compress, and put on a bandage: and put under the foot a board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind the bandage tightly around the foot, after you have covered it with cloths, and the rest that is needed
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, or more, then loosen the ligamentum
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For indeed you will find the bones equal, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is like that of blood
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any of the fingers are fractured, then restore them, and keep them equal as I have said in the restoration of the fingers of the hand
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger on the heel and extend it as long as the finger itself: let it be wider there than below: then place under the foot the board which I have told you of and bind it securely with a bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, the fracture is from the bones and there are two, or three, or more of them, then place over each finger a pad equal to its own quantity, enclosed in linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower part of the foot. Let it rest upon one head of the board outside the foot, so that it may hold the parts firmly in place.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	It is also fitting that you should remember, when considering all the fractures which result from accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary for its cure.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	As for the fracture of a woman's vulva, or of the bones of the thigh, or of the heel of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the part of the back which is towards her, and keep her firm behind her
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the obstetrician put his hand into the vulva until he reaches the bone: and let there be in the vulva from that which is like a sphere
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman bear down, and gradually lift up her back
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This will drive out the bone which is fractured, until it is like a sphere in front of the vulva, and the bone is healed
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wishes to go, move her limb with ease, then she will be able to go: and reduce her limb in the same way as you introduced it at the beginning: then return to her initial bandage
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	The bone shall be restored in seven days, or thereabouts.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	If desired, take a piece of gut and pass it through the hole, and string it over the opening of the wound. Then insert the gut entirely into the cavity of the wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow air through the tube until the gut is swollen within the wound, and the fracture will be healed
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is to be bound with a compress, and left for a few days, as we have said, until it is healed
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	When the bone of the arm or the woman breaks, then treat it in its restoration, and do to it as we have said concerning the bone of the forearm
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	The rectum should not be hidden in close fractures, which are not serious, especially for one who has studied or is learned.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, for a fracture itself signifies to you in many cases the need for a straight restoration and a loosening of its stricture: understand therefore
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the limb of a man when it breaks, take a gut of gut and grasp it: and insert it into itself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put upon it a covering of cloth, and bandage it, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a broken bone, when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It agrees with him whose misfortune has occurred a fracture with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the bone of the thigh or the bones of the forearm or the like of them, that you must immediately perform phlebotomy: if you find that the conditions for phlebotomy are attested, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If a vein bursts, then it is necessary to prepare for its ligation, so that it is pulverized above the surrounding tissue: if nothing else is present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Restore the fracture in the same day: do not delay this, if it does not happen spontaneously
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed a cold swelling occurs, then postpone the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling subsides
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	Do not approach it on the third or fourth day, for you will make it worse.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the fractured bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary to reduce it and align it with your hands with ease and a slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If it is not prepared for extension by your hands, and its alignment is not done: then reduce it with this instrument
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	The instrument is made of iron, its length is equal to the distance of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four [instruments] according to the quantity required for the care of each kind of fracture
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	Round in shape: and in size small, so that it does not double under compression at the time of operation: and acute at the extremities, which has a margin at the extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And its upper part should reach from the middle to the lower parts
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in the operation to place the acute end of the instrument curved over the protruding extremity: and press it with it until the bone returns to its place and is equal to the surrounding parts
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	To attempt to equalize the extremities fractured in unison.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the fracture is slight and does not hold the instruments well, then one may cut off the limb at the bone until the instruments can grasp it properly.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed it is not possible to reduce the limb as we have mentioned above, then one must amputate it along with its surrounding tissue as we have said before: or one may burn it off in any convenient way.</start_of_turn>
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then the remainder of the limb with its rough surface and small pieces of cartilage.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone has been reduced and the limb has been found to be still painful after its reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.</start_of_turn
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great comfort to the sufferer when you complete the restoration of the limb as you do the bone.</start_of_turn>
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the limb in lukewarm black wine.</start_of_turn
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And in summer especially.</start_of_turn>
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place upon the limb a greasy cloth, or anything containing oil: so that it does not cause it to become putrid and corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then give him urine at the hour of completing your restoration of the limb.</start_of_turn
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And discharge the limb detected: thus, that you cut with scissors a hole in the incisions according to the quantity of the wound.</start_of_turn
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take heed of all these things, that you do not tighten the limb with the fracture.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many have done this for the sake of surgery: they have caused harm to their patients either by death, or by injury, or by corrosion, or by cutting, that is, by restoring health.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And be your treatment soft, gentle, diverse according to the nature of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If a wound is bad, or is large, and times are great, there are certain harmful things which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the hanging part: then it is not fitting that you should put sponges upon it
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions from hard papers in the place of sponges, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, a day or two has passed, and the wound has begun to swell, that pus has been generated: then remove the sponge which you put upon it with wine
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply ointments and unguents which are customary with us to heal wounds: thus as unguentum of tetrapharmacon, and the like.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting that you soften the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is fitting that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus should flow downwards with ease
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass before the wound is consolidated, and the pus does not separate: then you know that there are small bone fragments there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	For you must inquire about the wound cautiously.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these small fragments are separated, remove them, and extract them themselves
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what remains of them which are not separated, and which puncture the limb, and cause pain, try to cut them out, and remove them in every possible way
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound occurs, or an ulcer, or swelling, or any other corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose each with that which agrees with it in respect of its treatment, of which account has been given in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And thus in this in which it is necessary to oppose it, you must have in your mind that which you make present to me when you break a bone and it hangs out from the limb, like the thighbone, and the joints, and the like of great limbs, for you must not imagine that it will draw on its own, for much harm thereby accrues from that liquid, indeed I would rather expel it than that it should putrefy.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall away of itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore care for the wound, if you see it: and otherwise, expel it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Note: The provided Latin text does not include any information about the care of nodulation in the case of a fractured bone, so I am unable to translate that part of the sentence.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this Nodulation occurs in the process of healing of a fractured bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the sutures: and it is nourished from that figure of the limb
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider in this, if nodulation exists: administer in it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like of these
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take from these some, or all of them: and mix them with wine that is astringent, or with albumin or with vinegar: and apply them to the nodulation covered in wax, and bind them over the suture
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	Release the tension and do not delay treatment for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Resume treatment and repeat until the swelling subsides completely.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the swelling a lead plate slightly askew from the center
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of driving out everything that is harmful from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the swelling has already gone into the stone and is tightly bound, and excessive tension results: then find above the swelling from the upper part downwards, and cut away the excess: or ligate the swelling with some instruments, until it subsides: and care for the wound until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When restoring, and the limb remains somewhat under tension even after this, do not follow the natural course of things.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn>
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When restoring a fractured bone, and some tension remains in the limb even after treatment, it is weak: then it is not done except for serious reasons.</start_of_turn>
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	There are several reasons for this weakness: the excessive tension of the ligaments, the tying of the ligaments in an unnatural way, the excessive application of ointment that hinders the supply of nourishment to the limb, or the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and the weakness of the patient.</start_of_turn
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and keep his body warm, until the blood supply to the limb is increased.</start_of_turn
Et administra balneum.	And apply a warm compress.</start_of_turn
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon it.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb: so that it attracts much nourishment to it.</start_of_turn
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	He diligently applies the ointment with warm water until the nourishment runs its course, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Until the nourishment has run its course.
Caput XXIII.	When restoring fractured bones to their original position.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the fractured limb has been restored after healing, and the protruding bone or swelling: then the limb is bound up in such a way as not to impede its natural action; for it is not necessary to break the limb again.</start_of_turn>
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there are many proud doctors and restorers of limbs who have done this in our land.</start_of_turn>
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is very dangerous, causing death or great fear, for it is mortal.</start_of_turn
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the fracture and swelling are recent: then it is necessary to apply the ointment with warm water, in which are boiled softening herbs, such as rue leaves, and the root of this, and mellilotus, and similar things.</start_of_turn
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make a plaster with a softening plaster, such as gypsum made into a center.</start_of_turn
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of rue root, and mix it with chicken fat, or beeswax: and plaster with it.</start_of_turn
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take colocynth seed, and grind it with poppy seed, and things of that kind which are mentioned by doctors to reduce consolidation.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling has subsided with persistent and gentle friction, as happens with wet hands.</start_of_turn
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb is administered to every part at all times.</start_of_turn
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, a swelling has preceded it [the pain], and has become strong, and has been converted into a lap [swelling], and has been provoked by the necessity of its cure with fire: then it is necessary, that the upper part be severed, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and that which has supervened from the node or bone with fine scissors: and it is to be administered with ease, with attention and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	If, however, a swelling has preceded it, and has become strong, and has been converted into a lap, and has been provoked by the necessity of its cure with fire: then it is necessary, that the upper part be severed, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and that which has supervened from the node or bone with fine scissors: and it is to be administered with ease, with attention and care.
Caput XXIIII.	If, however, a swelling has preceded it, and has become strong, and has been converted into a lap, and has been provoked by the necessity of its cure with fire: then it is necessary, that the upper part be severed, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and that which has supervened from the node or bone with fine scissors: and it is to be administered with ease, with attention and care.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some parts from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is prohibited from its movement, and deforms the figure of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the occurrence of greater pain, and wounds which are dangerous to health
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When, therefore, such a dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: and do not delay at all
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is spoiled, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation itself
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary to move, or extend it in the hour of its displacement
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it makes many times the spasm, and painful aches.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when it has happened, then it is necessary to prepare for bleeding of the limb.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is to be let go, until the displacement has subsided
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb is bound with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb is cared for with that which reminds it in its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I command you to keep the parts of dislocation in their place, also as it has been said in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	About the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.</start_of_turn>
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles are rarely displaced except in rare cases.</start_of_turn>
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with a slight displacement, and are softened gently.</start_of_turn
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are displaced completely, without displacement, until they are softened to the chest, until the pain has gone away, and it cannot bear to be closed, neither can it close the bone, and the tongue is involved with the speech.</start_of_turn
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the displacement is small, then it returns to its places by itself with little attention.</start_of_turn
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the displacement is complete, the whole: then it must be immediately administered the reduction of it without delay: and it is necessary that the head of the patient should remain still: and the physician should insert a finger of his hand into the root of the mandible which is displaced between the bones of the dislocation, if the dislocation is from one side.</start_of_turn
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two fingers of his hand at the same time, if the dislocation is from both sides.</start_of_turn
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, where they are equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick man to loosen his teeth and bite down on everything evenly
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The doctor equalizes the jaw and urges the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then apply heat with warm water and oil, until the reduction becomes easy of both: do not reduce them both at once, as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and are equal, and the bone of the sick man is closed, and not softened: then place over the teeth of the pulp the cerate made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And it is bound with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be resting between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left: neither should he be forced or urged to chew anything: rather let him take a soft diet, until when he moves his pain subsides, and the jaw is relaxed: then he can eat what he wants, and this is administered with ease
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He does not suffer from the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and swallowing, until the jaw is relaxed and healed
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult, when they are displaced at some time, and do not return to their places: then many times arise from this fever and sourness: and perhaps the sickness of the patient is relieved, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you have done this: then you know that it is a loss, and many times a man dies for whom this happened in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Furcula does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuation with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It dislocates sometimes outwards: and this is recognized by sense
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lies with his back on the bed, and extends his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your strong palm, for it will return by itself
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put over it a compress, and sponges, and bind it tightly
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of it which follow the elbow, and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and made even according to what has been said, and that it be prepared for you
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put over it a compress, and sponges, and bind it tightly
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the extremity of the humerus has been reduced by this treatment, even when it is separated from its place
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	And concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus does not dislocate, except according to three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	The first is that it dislocates to the part of the elbow downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates to the part of the breastbone.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is displaced to the upper part of the Humerus: and this rarely occurs.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not displace to the posterior, because of the splatter.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not displace to the anterior, because of the nerves
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And mostly it is displaced and comes down towards the lower side of the elbow: especially in those whose flesh is little
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it comes out quickly and goes in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those in whom the flesh is much, it is contrary to this, namely because it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or an accident, and the Humerus is displaced by a hot after-effect, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced already.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to try this until you are certain of its displacement, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is recognized as displaced when it comes down towards the elbow: and you will distinguish between a displaced Humerus and a sound Humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find between these two a remarkable difference, and in the head of the Humerus a concavity, and under the elbow at the touch of the hand as if it were bone itself: and you cannot reduce the limb with a gentle hand, neither can you move it in any way
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Likewise, if it is displaced towards the breast or upwards: then you will find a clear touch, neither hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in these cases the displacement is easily reduced when it is recent, or when the limb is weak
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it elevates the minister's hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	And then place your thumbs under the edge of its [wound] and elevate the connecting tissue with strength upwards to its place: and the minister will elevate his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	And then place the lower part downwards, and he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return by that which we have said, and if many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary to bathe the patient in warm water, and to apply an embolus which softens and smoothens, like the decoction of wild roses, and fennel, and meadowsweet in water, and to administer these things.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	And then the patient is laid on his back: and under his edge is placed a sphere and a bandage, which is equal between softness and tension
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	And then the physician places his heel on the sphere, and elevates the upper part of the arm with force, and pulls the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: he himself returns immediately
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if necessary, reduce it in this way: make the strong hand which is longer than the patient to stand at the side and introduce the arm under the edge of the patient: and elevate the edge upwards until the patient is suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister pulls the patient's hand downwards into his belly
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the patient is slight: then it is necessary to suspend it with something else, so as to ease him: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in another manner: thus it is formed in the earth a long stick whose head is rounded like a mortuary glove: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	And then it is placed under the patient after the linen has been placed over the head of the stick: and the patient shall be standing in accordance with the length of the stick
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	And then the hand is extended downwards from the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with force: for the joining returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is the quantity of two arms, and whose width is the quantity of four fingers, and whose thickness is the quantity of two fingers: whose head is rounded, in order to facilitate its entrance into the depth of the wound, according to this form
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	And then the linen is bound over the rounded head, so that it does not damage the sick stick.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	And then it is placed under the wound of the patient, so that the hand, or the arm, is extended over the stick until downwards: and the stick is bound over the aid and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	And then the arm is placed over the step of the ladder for its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the remainder of the body is let go from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joining enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When thus the entrance is completed according to any possible method: then it is necessary that you place under the wound a sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	And then place a prepared plaster from pounded wheat with oil, and white of egg over the whole arm, as it is turned outwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then string under the thumb a stricture of decency: and the ligament will be returned over the palm above: and its hand shall be annexed to its column, and it shall be let go, neither shall its hand move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary to provide the patient with food, until comfort the limb: because it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then put on a wider dressing after seven days, or five, and take it off when it moves.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is firm and is not softened, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If indeed the suture is loosened many times, because of the humidity that has happened to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that there be administered upon it cautery with three holes, according as it is prescribed in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If thus you do all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture does not hold, and the palm and the stricture above it are reduced, and do not harden, and fall away, and do not raise themselves up: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the suture will never be fixed in its place
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for a dislocation which happens towards the breast and the nipple, or towards the back, it is reduced with a push and extension with the hands: until it returns, and there is administered in the rest stricture and care, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there remains a degree of stiffness in the limb, and slowness in its movement: then the patient is to be bathed many times, until that stiffness is softened, and it returns to its former state
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	(The text provided does not include information regarding the cure of dislocation of the cubitus, so I cannot translate this portion.)
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the dislocation of the cubital bone is difficult, and returns with difficulty: and it dislocates to all parts, especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not hidden: for it hangs loose under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated in
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubital bone with the sound one, it is declared that it is manifest
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	It must be united again, and must not double the arm, nor touch it with the other arm
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you should promptly reduce the dislocation before a cold swelling should set in
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a cold swelling should set in, its reduction becomes difficult: and it may not be healed at all, especially when it is at the back
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is bad in all species of dislocation, and of greater pain: and it descends with great swelling.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend the limb with two hands: and the arm be extended, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and below it, and he himself urges the union with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front: then it returns in such a way that it doubles the hand with the hand, until it reaches the root of the palm of the hand which is dislocated
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey reduction, then manage violent extension, strength permitting: and it is that two assistants extend the limb: and they must hold it also, so that it does not move during the extension
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is returned to its entirety after the thumb has been wrapped over the hand with a doubled long bandage or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	When the physician grasps the hand, let him moisten it with oil: that it may be slippery and facilitate the procedure.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he impels the bandage with force until it returns
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And afterwards, when the reduction has taken place, it is necessary to place over it a dressing which has styptic properties and which will dry out with alum: and the wound should be bound securely
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	The arm should be suspended from the collar of the patient: and it should be allowed to rest for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is healed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the bandage remains firm in its place, then the ligament must be divided from it and the thumb be allowed to rest
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	If the bandage has not been bound firmly, then repeat the dressing, the ligament and the thumb: and allow it to rest for a few days until it is bound securely
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it is healed
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there should be pain after the reduction of the bandage, and the limb should be still: then administer moisture in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the limb is firm, or put on an ilium above the bandage, that is, a piece of sheep's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound and allowed to rest day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away the bandage and immerse the limb in a bath
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is sweating, then gently friction the bandage
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	And repeat over it once, twice and three times with the entrance of the bath, until it is softened
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	If desired, place upon the wound a cushion of wool, moist, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	If desired. Place upon the wound a cushion of wool, moist, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The wound itself is softened, and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	From the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The limb of Mahassem is much dislocated, that is, the juncture which is between the arm and the hand
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Except for the remaining joints
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Truly, speed must be in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it settles in another place: or it will happen that in that settling it will become stiff
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of Mahassem upon a board, and extend the limb of the hand: and the physician places his palm upon the prominence of the juncture and urges it until it returns
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Truly, it must be considered that if the palm has receded towards the belly of the hand: then the infirm person places the back of his hand upon the board at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand is inside the board, that is, the inner part of the hand is placed upon the board, so that the hand of the physician rests upon the prominence of the juncture
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind the limb with a dressing while it is settling: and let it go, and do not do it again.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he will not tolerate it, neither will the flesh tolerate a reduction after these days; for truly the suture will remain according to the tortuousness of its situation: and it does not harm the sick man anything, except that it soothes the hand, and it is not possible to tighten anything: then you know that the nerves are severed, or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no wit in that, except that it be tied with cautery close to the case of its situation.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it will not do anything at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When the Almahassem does not return, then place above it a covering, as we have narrated
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is to be tied, and let go in five days: afterwards it is to be dissolved and let go, and the hand is to be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is prevented in it, and anything heavy occurs in it: then soften it with warm water, and with gentle friction, until it is softened
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Of the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the finger is dislocated from the bone towards the whole part, or from the bone towards the back of the palm, or towards the belly of the hand: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation gently with your thumbs, until it returns
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the part from which it is dislocated, and let it go in two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is equal to its proper position in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, bind it according to the account given: and do not cease to loosen it daily: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do it for a few days until it is strung together.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	Do it in like manner for a few days until it is bound together.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	Do it in like manner when it is displaced to the other side.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	From the treatment of dislocation of the cervical vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the cervical vertebra is completely displaced, or many of them are displaced from their places: then it is not in this treatment, for the moisture favors the sick person
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the sickness goes out without being willing, neither can he keep it: and many times they soften a part of his body from that, or two limbs, or two arms, or one of them: or they displace one vertebra from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times they displace it because many times there is displacement of them to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is displaced to the back is called gibbosity
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is, indeed, that they are united together again when the gibbosity happens from infancy: then there is no healing from it at all
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, what happened in the case, or by percussion, or in a like manner, the ancients said of ancient methods of treatment in a long speech
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which many do not return when they are proficient
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself, however, have abbreviated from that, because of the many things that are close to me in this matter: and the exposition that I have made which exposes this thing, and the instrument that I have composed in a diverse way from that which they have shown.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that which happens in the body from the anterior part, is neither ingenuity nor healing.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	Likewise, whatever happens on either side is also not ingenuity or healing.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	It does not heal from the outside, except that which happens in its own depth, as I have said: that the sick man be extended over his face towards the equal ledge near the wall, and that there be applied over him a moist dressing, so that his chest is not injured thereby.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a fixed rod be placed in the fire in the ground, at the foot, round about the head: and let another rod be placed round about the feet at the other foot: and let the minister hold the rod, and let it not be fixed in the fire
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the other minister hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then stretch over the head of the sick man, and under his toes, a soft ligament, firm: and extend the extremity of the ligament to the rod which is at his head: and bind it in that place
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	And bind another ligament above his shoulders, and above his knees, and at his hips.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather up all the ligaments and bind them to the other rod which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let all the ministers extend to the part of the limb of the ligaments, and do not move the two rods from their places where they are fixed: indeed they are not fixed, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor places his palms upon the spine with strength, until he recovers: or places them upon a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he connects upon the board his feet until he recovers
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not recover by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms long.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the cavity in the wall from which we have spoken, which is close to the patient, is the place where the extremity of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the Spondilem.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician put his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And bind firmly, until Spondilis is taut, and return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that the heel of the patient lies in the earth between two boards which are as long as an arm at the shoulder: and at the head of these two boards between the heel and the two boards is the heel of the ankle itself
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length which is between all the boards is the palm of one hand: and thus it is made in every place where there is a passage of the bone: and fix all the boards firmly to the earth, so that nothing moves at all
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert a round board: and it is the bone which revolves the ligament in two holes of the two boards.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the extremity of it is a hole in which the board is fixed, which is as long as the palm together with that which revolves: and in two other boards it is like that
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And bind the ligaments which you have bound in the chest of the patient around the ankle which is at the head of it: and the ligaments which you have bound in the thighs of the patient around the ankle which is at the feet of it
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	And remain at every turn of the minister who is turning his hand with a wrench, with which the bone is revolved: and the physician will equal Spondilis, as we have said
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turn which follows
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, it is necessary to apply a plaster cast with albumin or urine.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, apply the plaster cast.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	And place above the plaster cast a bandage of three fingers' width, or thereabouts
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of it should be as much as to cover the part of Gibbositatis and above the healthy part of Spondilis
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	And it is bound with the bandage we mentioned above
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be given a nourishing diet until he has recovered.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains swollen in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the plaster cast that we mentioned previously for a long time
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And in that layer of lead is administered
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when swelling occurs in the posterior Spondilium dorsi: and it is believed to be dislocation, and that is the bone that is now protruding
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not right to assume for it any medicine: for perhaps thereby it will cause death
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated Anchae.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that dislocations of the Anchae, and of the humerus, do not occur except for a violent dislocation: neither do they occur except for a slight displacement and a concavity
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the Anchae is divided into four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is displaced forward and backward
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Most often, the dislocation is inward: slightly less often, it is forward, and least of all backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of such an inward dislocation is: because when you unite the limb of the sick with the limb of the healthy, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick is more prominent than that of the healthy, and he cannot double up his foot at the ankle: and this is the place which follows the ankle after the heel has slipped over the heel of the other limb, because the head of the thigh has already gone there.</start_of_turn>
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of such an outward dislocation is that there are injuries to the limb which are contrary to these injuries.</start_of_turn>
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of such a forward dislocation is that it expands the healthy limb along the whole extent: truly, it does not double itself without pain at the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go beyond this forward: and he retains his urine, and his heel slips over his ankle, and there is swelling in his walking.</start_of_turn
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of such a backward dislocation is that neither the knee nor the ankle expands: neither can he double up his limb before he doubles his ankle: and his limb is even shorter than the other: and his ankle is soft, and the head of the thigh is at the level of the hip.</start_of_turn
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of such a dislocation is a difficult thing, so that if the dislocation is old, which has been there for a long time, it becomes fixed with the limb itself.</start_of_turn
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you perform the reduction and it remains in its place: then there is no longer any treatment in that case.</start_of_turn>
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not right therefore to suppose that it is sufficient.</start_of_turn
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case in which the dislocation is fixed, and is one of the four kinds of dislocation: then it is proper for you to join the limb and extend it both forward and backward, and to move the limb from side to side: perhaps thereby the dislocation will be reduced, and no other treatment will be necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister and extend his leg from the lower part: either with the hands alone or with a ligature which is bound above the knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under the tiles of his leg.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then string it with a soft ligature over the root of the hip, and hold the extremity of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the buttocks, or from the back to the part of the back
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be all at once, until the patient is lifted with his body from the earth, and remains hanging
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is one of the common kinds of extension of four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns with this, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary to use every kind of treatment which we mentioned concerning proper care.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction, however, of its own when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then lay a ligament upon the root of the hip, in that place which is between the head of the hip and the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the upper part of the body, to the part of the buttocks
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	And another minister takes a strong arm and grasps the thick part of the lower hip, and extends it outwards with the extension mentioned above.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the rest of the treatments by which this limb is reduced
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he excuses himself from thee, and doth not obey thy order to enter with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary, that two feet of the patient be bound together with a strong, soft ligament, over two calcanei, and over two knees: and that the length of each be equal to four fingers; and that the diseased limb be extended more than the other by two fingers' breadth.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	The diseased limb is then suspended over the head of the ligament, which is in the house: and its length from the ground is equal to the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong youth to grasp the hip: and suspend it with the patient together: and the youth grasps the other, grasping the hip with force, for the ligament returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But when its dislocation is outwards, it is necessary that the patient lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligament is bound over the limb itself, and over the breast.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are laid, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a board is laid in the middle of the foot, fixed well: over which are laid wet cloths, that they do not hurt the patient: and let the board rest between his thighs, so that it does not be drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then extend all the limbs to their proper parts, and the physician equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If, therefore, he obeys towards restoration, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon his head a board, and press it down, as we said in the case of a gibbosity, equally
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	The patient must lie upon his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb of the patient quickly: and it is in accordance with this that the physician places his right hand upon the patient's knee
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he grasps the limb with the other hand and, with that embrace, he stretches it downwards to the ankle
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is backwards, then it is not necessary to stretch the limb downwards, but rather to elevate it above the ground: indeed it is necessary to place it upon a firm support, as it is also done if the dislocation is wide outwards, as we mentioned above concerning the recumbent position.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary to apply a compress also with a board upon the place where the fracture has been reduced, until the reduction is complete.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden: when you extend both limbs of the patient and when he tightens his limb and expands it without pain: then you know that the limb has been reduced, as it should be: then join the two thighs and apply a dressing, and bind with a bandage, that is, by rotation: so that it does not move to any part: and let the patient rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the dressing, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, you know that the dislocation is fixed: absolutely so let the patient walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	If you see any softening: then repeat the reduction, and apply the dressing once more, and bind it as before: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then solve that and make it tardy in walking on both sides for a few days, until it is comfortable.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Until it is comfortable.
Caput XXXIII.	Until it is comfortable.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	Until it is comfortable
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	Until it is comfortable
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	Until it is comfortable
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	Until it is comfortable
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	Until it is comfortable
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	Until it is comfortable
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Until it is comfortable
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Until it is comfortable
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	Until it is comfortable
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	Until it is comfortable
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Until it is comfortable
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Until it is comfortable
Deinde solue ea.	Until it is comfortable.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	Until it is comfortable
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	Until it is comfortable
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Until it is comfortable
Caput XXXIIII.	Until it is comfortable
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	Until it is comfortable
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	Either the dislocation is towards the interior, or towards the exterior.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of dislocation is that the calcaneus is swollen, proceeding towards the part from which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for the removal of the dislocation is easy restoration: it is to extend with ease with the hands, and to straighten out, until it returns to its place
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of the dislocation when it is displaced according to the rule, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and hold him firmly from behind the back of his back, in the middle of his body.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold your right hand the upper part of his foot, and your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle bone.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with your left hand support both ankles.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand, and push the ankle with your right hand without pain
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the ankle towards the knee in the third space, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns in one space, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot is equal, it is good: and if not, do the operation again over it: because it will return
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, it is forbidden for you to reduce it as we have said: then make the patient lie on his back on the earth, and fix the heel firmly on the ground, under the buttocks: and put a cushion under his thighs so that it lies between his thighs: and I will support over it above the ankle, so that it does not pain the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then he will grasp the coxal bone of the minister: afterwards he will extend the other minister's foot, either with his hands or with a ligament which binds over the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then he will extend all the ministers against the extension of their companion: and the little toe will be stable between the two coxae of the patient, retaining him, so that it does not draw the body towards the lower parts during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor will equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other minister will hold the sound limb towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation has returned, and it is declared that the limb is in a state of restoration: then put on a compress and a bandage, and bind the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot with a ligament to the ankle
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware of the nerves that are above the heel behind, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that you do not damage them
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go in two or three days
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, bind it: then solve it on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that time, there will be no security that the dislocation will be dissolved above and not be damaged, and it will not recover after that time
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there is a swelling of the heel: then it is necessary that you administer in sedation for it that in which it was mentioned in the story before concerning the treatment, and embrocation, until it is resolved
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and their care.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter V.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	The head should be adjusted so that it becomes level with the dislocation of the bone from its place without excessive effort: this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some knot of the back or foot: then it is necessary to make the patient sit down with the affected limb resting on the ground or on a board: and thus it is as if he were walking
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand up, and place your foot upon that which projects from the joints
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then step upon it with your foot with force, until it returns to its place, and let it be seen to be level, and not to project outwards.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the foot a board which will hold the foot entirely, having two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	And bind it with a bandage three days in a row.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make it rest from walking for many days, until it is bound up and secured from reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	And concerning the species of dislocation with wound or fracture
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything has happened, and you know the cure and the restoration of it, many times success follows: and because of this it does not be necessary to rush over the cure, which is of this sort, except for one who is prudent in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, tardy, not daring, and not rash: and that he should make use of the advice of physicians who sit around the sickbed only for warmth: and let the patient go with the judge's decision.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you believe, or hope for recovery with the gentleness of treatment, and in which there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	To attempt a reduction immediately at the outset of the case, before the swelling becomes hardened.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb returns, as we desire, then administer a regimen that will quiet the swelling: and care for the wound with those things which are appropriate to it from among the desiccant unguents.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture, and they are separated from the socket, then attempt to ablate them, and do in that what we said in the simple rules concerning these things in their place.</start_of_turn>
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your skill, and take care of yourself from the entrance into the danger: according to what I have predicted to you.</start_of_turn>
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you with the Creator of all things, and more lasting for your glory, and more health for your body in this life.</start_of_turn>
