of the fracture of the neck
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and rarely does it bend; and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will recover or not, take note if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally [injured] in several ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if treatment is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, take note if the feet are softened, and if the same things happen to them as to the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary defecation; and when he is turned on his stomach, there is involuntary defecation.
And when he is turned on his back and he wants to sit up, he cannot.
Know that he is mortally [injured]: so do not work on his treatment.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment is that you see if there is a hot abscess, then put on the spine rose oil or oil of egg yolks, until it is soothed; then apply one of the strengthening and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and tell the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the side where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut to the heart of it; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "tail head", put in the thumb of your left hand, and align it with your other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and splint on top, if you need it; then tighten it, and if there is a separated bone, cut into it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
