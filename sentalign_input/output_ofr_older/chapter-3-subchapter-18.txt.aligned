Of the fracture of the wrist bone	On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.	0.41642737
And when the wrist bone of a man or woman is fractured, restore it as we have said for the hip bone; and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices this, and understands my book. For the fracture itself shows in many ways the proper method of restoration: therefore, understand it.	Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip. The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine. For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.	0.7553242

When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.	0.81770766
