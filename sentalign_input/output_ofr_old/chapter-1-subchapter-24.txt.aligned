of the cough When a cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is chronic, then make two cauterizations on the chest in empty places; and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be the one called "clavile" according to the form previously described.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	0.883888
And if you wish, make a cauterization by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points," of which the form is found earlier in the discussion of ear ailments; and let there be up to 30 pricks, or thereabouts.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty.	0.77074397
Afterwards treat the area according to what has been said before, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:	Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	0.433393
And because of this the cauteries are easier, because you make three at once.	Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.5892794
