Chapter Twenty-One.
On incising the uvea.
If a hernia occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person, and you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.
That is, you insert a needle into the base of the growth from below to above. Then you insert another needle threaded with a double thread from the side of the canthus, and pass it through.  Leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the doubled thread at the loop and tie some of the growth around the needle and tighten it gently. Then remove the needle and apply wool moistened with egg white to the eye, and leave it until the threads fall off with the growth.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. You can also tie the growth from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye swells up gently, then lance it with a thin scalpel reaching to the depths of the eye, so the aqueous humor flows and the eye shrinks and withers on the spot, then bandage it until it heals.
