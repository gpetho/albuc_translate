of the pain of the teeth
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or wind, and the medicine treatments do not help, then a cautery is needed in two ways: with butter or with fire.
The butter cautery is done by taking cow's butter and melting it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it on the tip of a stick, soak it in the melted butter, and apply it quickly to the aching tooth and hold it until it cools; do this often until the effect reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
The fire cautery is done by taking an iron or brass ring, and making it large enough so the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; afterward heat the cautery, whose shape will be mentioned later, and place it on the tooth and hold it until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next. And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter during the application of the cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make the cautery of whichever head you want, and according to what you have available; and this is the shape of the ring:
