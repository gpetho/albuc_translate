Chapter XXVIII.
On the incision of flesh attached to the gums.
Often, flesh attached to the gum grows, which the ancients called albulus, then you must suspend it with a nail or hold it with forceps and cut it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place on the site pounded sage or other astringent or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, because after the cautery it will not return.
