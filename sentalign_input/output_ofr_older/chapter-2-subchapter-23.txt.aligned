Then rest a little, and if the water rises again a second time, place it with the instrument, and when it is fixed and it does not rise, then lightly withdraw the almagda by turning your hand little by little; and then place a little of ground rock salt in the water, and wash the eye inside. Then place on the outside of the eye wadding or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.  We, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white on it.	Then let him rest a little while; and if the humour goes back up again depress it a second time without taking the needle out. When it stays down firmly and does not come back again, gently draw the needle out, twisting it ever so slowly with your hand. Then dissolve a little pure rock-salt in water and wash the eyeball with the solution; then apply all over the outer aspect of the eye carded linen or wool moistened with oil of roses and egg-white, and bandage it up together with the sound eye. Now we and our contemporaries apply pounded cumin with the egg-white.	0.9324987
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are some men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:	But if the couching needle does not serve, failing to enter the eye on account of its hardness (for there are some whose eyes are hard indeed), you should take the scalpel called al-baridl figured thus.	0.7070915
If a hot abscess comes, you must untie the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with what soothes the abscess; and when it is soothed, then untie the vision and place a small pillow on his face to cover it for a few days, and keep him in that dark room. And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his normal activities; and know that no disciples should interfere in this case.	But if an abscess occur you should unbandage the eye before the seventh day and restore it to health by those methods that allay swelling. When it has subsided, allow him free sight, putting over his face a dark veil beneath which his vision may be exercised for a few days while he is still in the dark room. Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business. But you should know that in the case of a depression of a cataract the student cannot manage without having seen that operation performed several times; then he may perform it himself.	0.82619727
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they make a pierced almagda, with which they suck the water, but I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.	I have heard that a certain Iraqi has said that in Iraq he makes a hollow needle by which the humour is sucked out. In our land I have never seen anyone do it in this fashion, nor have I read of it described in any of the books of the Ancients; perhaps it is newly invented.	0.7729336
And let their heads be of the same delicacy, and the back in three sharp angles.	They are mostly made of brass; and their extremities should be of this very fineness, triangular at the tip and sharp.	0.5088193
