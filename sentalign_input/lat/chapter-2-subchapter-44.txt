On the cutting of a throat hernia.
Chapter 44.
This abscess called a throat hernia is a large abscess, matching the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it occurs in two types: it is either natural or accidental.
Certainly, in the natural type there is no remedy.
The accidental type, however, has two forms: one of which is similar to fatty nodes.
The other form is similar to an abscess that arises from the swelling of an artery.
And in it there is danger, and one should not presume to treat it with a knife, unless it is small: and you should test it, and investigate it with a probe.
If you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it as nodes are cut: and remove it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then inspect it fully.
Then treat the area with what is required for healing, until it is cured.
