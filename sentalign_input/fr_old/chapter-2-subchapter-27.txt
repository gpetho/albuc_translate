About abscesses of the lips
In many men, hard abscesses, resembling grains of vetch, form inside the lips, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut above each knot, and take it with pincers and cut it in each part; then fill the area after the incision with ground vitriol until the blood is staunched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with drying substances until it is healed.
