Chapter Thirty on the Extraction of Teeth
It is appropriate to treat the tooth for its pain with every possible remedy and to be hesitant about extracting it, for there is no replacement for it if it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, even if there is no alternative but to extract it.
So it is appropriate, if the ailing person is determined to extract it, that you ascertain and verify that the aching tooth is indeed the one, for often the pain deceives the ailing person, and he thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, and then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.
We have seen this from the actions of cuppers repeatedly.
So if you are certain about the aching tooth itself, then it is appropriate to incise around the tooth with a lancet that has some strength, until you loosen the gum from every side, then move it with your fingers or with the gentle forceps first, little by little, until you loosen it, then at that point secure it firmly with the large forceps while the ailing person's head is between your knees, firmly held so he doesn't move, then pull the tooth straight so you don't break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every direction gently, and keep moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or corroded, it is appropriate to fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin file so that it does not shatter when you pull on it with the forceps, and it is appropriate to be thorough in incising around the gum from every side carefully, and be careful with your effort so you donâ€™t break it, and some of it remains, causing the ailing person a calamity greater than his first pain.
And beware of doing what the ignorant cuppers do in their haste and rushing into extracting it without using what we described, for they often inflict great calamities upon people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or some of its roots remain.
Or that they extract it with some of the jawbone as we have witnessed repeatedly.
Then after extracting it, he should rinse his mouth with wine or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs from the area, and this often happens, then crush some vitriol and pack the area with it, or otherwise cauterize it if the vitriol does not benefit you.
The shape of the gentle forceps with which you move the tooth first should be long-tipped, short-handled, and thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them.
And this is the shape of the large forceps:
It should be, as you see, thick in the handles so that when gripped it does not give way or bend, and short in the extremities.
And let it be made of Indian iron or of well-wrought, polished steel at the extremities.
And at its end are teeth that interlock with one another, so it grips firmly and tightly.
And the extremities may be made in the form of a file, and it will also be strong in gripping.
