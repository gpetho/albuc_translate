The wrist joint is frequently dislocated.  Its reduction is easier than other joints, except that it should be reduced quickly, at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot swelling appears in it.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.84272045
Its reduction is done by placing the patient's wrist on a board and an assistant extends his hand. The physician puts his palm on the protuberance of the joint and pushes it until it returns. However, it should be observed whether the dislocation has moved towards the inside of the hand.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.8567311
So let the patient place the back of his hand on the board when extending and reducing. And if the dislocation protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the protuberance of the joint itself.  If it returns immediately, good. Otherwise, bandage it with a dressing that reduces swelling.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself. If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.	0.83536917
And leave it; do not try again, for it will not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked.  And it will not harm the patient at all, unless the hand is weakened and unable to grasp anything.	Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed. But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised.	0.87324095
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except to cauterize it. Perhaps this will be beneficial, and perhaps it will be of no use.  When the wrist reduction is complete, apply the dressing that we described, then bandage it and leave it for five days.	In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all. When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.72647184
Then untie it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, soften it with warm water and massage it repeatedly until it softens.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.7618679
