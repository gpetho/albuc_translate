 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.
On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.
 The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are.
The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.
If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking.
Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.
Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads.
After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.
When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.
 If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it.
Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.
If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.
And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.
