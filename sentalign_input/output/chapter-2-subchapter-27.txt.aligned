On the extraction of those causes that come in the two lips in the inner parts.	On the extraction of nodules occurring on the lip.	0.5398912
Many times it happens to many men that in the inner parts of their lips there are hard abscesses resembling grains of barley, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.	A good many people sometimes get little hard swellings inside their lips, some resembling the vetch grain; some larger, some smaller.	0.81356204
So you must turn the lips and cut each of those hardnesses from every part, and then fill the site of the excision with pounded sage until the blood is stopped, and then wash it with sour wine and treat the site with what is astringent, until it is healed.	You should invert the lip, incise all along each nodule, catch it up with a hook, and cut it away all round. Then after incising rub pounded vitriol into the places until the bleeding stops. Then let him rinse with vinegar and salt, and dress the place with styptic drugs till the wounds heal.	0.7817194
