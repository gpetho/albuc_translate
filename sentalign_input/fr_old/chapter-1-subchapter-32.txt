of the swelling of the feet
When the feet are swollen in a dropsical person, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning. Do not go too deep, so the citrine water can flow out, and let the cautery be in this shape:
Then make two cauteries on each leg with the point of the knife-shaped cautery; let the cautery be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so the water can flow out; afterward treat with the other treatments we mentioned.
