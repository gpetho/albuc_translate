Chapter twenty-three on cupping for the water that descends into the eye.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which one is suitable for the cupping glass, with detailed and explained words, so you take it from there correctly.
Then, you should sit the patient between your hands, squared facing the light near the sun, and tie his healthy eye, tightening it well.
Then you lift his eyelid with your left hand if the eye that has the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping glass near the iris, with the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, from the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping glass with force while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping glass that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent of the cupping glass's going into the depth is equal to the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the iris of the eye, for you see the copper in the eye of the observer himself, due to the clarity of the cornea.
Then you move the cupping glass upwards to the place where the water is, then you press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see whatever his sight opens upon immediately, with the cupping glass in his eye. Then he rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping glass.
And when it settles and doesn't rise, remove the cupping glass gently while twisting it with your hand little by little.
Then you dissolve in water a bit of pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then you place on the outside of the whole eye lint or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and you tie the healthy eye with it.
As for us and the people of our time, we put on it ground cumin with egg white.
If the cupping glass does not respond to you for entering the eye due to its hardness, because among people there are those whose eyes are very hard, then you should take the lancet that is called the 'barid,' which is this image:
So you pierce only the conjunctiva itself, and do not go deep in the piercing.
It is only that you tap a fine spot for the lancet, then insert the lancet as we mentioned.
And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and he refrains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food what softens his nature, and he does not move his head right or left at all, and the bandage remains as it is until the third day, then you loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision, and show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not appropriate that you do that at the time of treatment or after the lancing immediately, but it is appropriate that you avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, it is appropriate to unbind the eye before the seventh day and correct that with what calms the swelling, so that when it subsides, then you release his vision and place a veil over his face, training his vision from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then he leaves the room gradually and manages his affairs.
And know that in lancing, the learner cannot do without observation several times, then he proceeds to the work.
And it has reached me from some of the Iraqis that he mentioned that a perforated lancet is made in Iraq that sucks the water with it, and I have not seen anyone in our country do that, nor have I read it in a book of the early books, and it is possible that this is a recent innovation.
And this is a picture of types of lancets for those who are ignorant of them to understand:
It is made specifically of copper.
And its tip is of this exact thinness, triangular and sharp.
