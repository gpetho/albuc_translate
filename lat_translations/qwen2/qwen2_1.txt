Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After completing the book for you, my children, on this science of medicine which is complete and includes its complement, and having reached the end thereof through explanations and his own declarations, it becomes necessary for me to add to you this Treatise which forms part of the practice section, that is, surgery with its manual.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the art of surgery practised with a hand is in our area and time completely isolated, perhaps until knowledge of it disappears and its practice ceases. Then only partial descriptions remain from the ancient books, which have been altered by hands; errors and hesitations occur until intentions are exhausted, making his efforts prolonged. I find it necessary to revive that art using the arrangement of this Treatise according to principles derived from position, explanation, and abbreviation. To incorporate knowledge about the forms of surgical instruments such as cautery and other tools used in surgery. The addition comes from an explanation and the correction of what is needed.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a skilled artisan cannot be found practising his art with his own hands in our current time is: because the art of medicine is long and requires him to engage in the study of anatomy as described by Galen before this. He must know the functions of the organs, their shapes, how they join and separate. He must have knowledge of bones, nerves, sinews, their numbers, exit places for them. And he needs to understand pulsating veins and quiet veins, and where these exit from in the body.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, said Hippocrates, the name with its name is much, and the work with its performance is little, especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because whoever does not understand what we said about anatomy will fall into error, just as many of them are that train in this knowledge and boast about it without understanding, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a vain doctor drain a scrofulous pustule on a woman's neck, and injured some arteries in the neck. Therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who thought he would extract a stone from urine, which was progressing in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he went to him, and extracted it along with part of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	As a result, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed, I was already called upon to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was taking a post at one of our lords' territories due to his knowledge in medicine: and it happened that there was a black eunuch with him, who had a fracture near the heel in his leg. The doctor acted without knowing what he was doing, tightened the fracture over the wound with bandages and pins, and applied strong pressure without allowing any air to escape from the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed what was desired of him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	He discharged him after a few days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage. He stood like that until the pustule on his leg and foot burst, and he ended up in ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him: and I rushed to loosen the bandage; and peace followed, and he was released from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already been established in the limb: and I was unable to arrest it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So therefore, corruption ceased to roam within the limb until its demise.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who had pierced the cancerous abscess; and after days, an ulcer formed until his illness became evident to the lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is why, when there's a pure cancer due to black bile, then it should not be approached with iron completely unless it's within an organ that can withstand the operation, so that the entire thing can be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, my children, you must know that an operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, one where health is associated with the operation; and one where there is danger in multiple dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already indicated in every part of this book where an operation comes about that involves fear and anxiety.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, you must be cautious about this and dismiss it: so as not to find a foolish way for speaking and being disgraceful.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	So receive this with care and concern and protection, and treat your patients with ease and strength, utilizing a better path for healing through God's grace to benefit health and commendable succession. And dismiss the terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure. Take away your souls from what makes you afraid, so as not to allow hesitation in your faith and advantage when it comes to entering into them.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there is more that remains for your glory, and it's higher in this world, and finally towards your qualities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen had indeed said so in some of his instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat bad illness: fear the name of the doctor's evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	And now, I divide this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter one deals with the use of the cautery with fire, and the cautery with acute medicine, organized from head to feet, and the forms of instruments and tools for the cautery: and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter two deals with the sectioning and puncturing, bloodletting and venting, and wounds: as well as the removal of arrows and similar objects: and everything else organized in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Chapter three deals with the restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torsions, and similar issues. It is organized from head to feet in terms of the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Chapter on the application and effects of the cautery: which types of constitution it is suitable for, when to use it, whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Head I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before recalling the procedure of using it, one must say about its qualities and effects. And to which constitution they are applicable.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say that the discussion about the quality of the cautery's healing effect and its adverse effects is a lengthy and subtle one. It involves knowledge and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on this topic and there were disagreements among them. Indeed, I am content with only a little of their discourse to avoid going too far into detail.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that the cauterizing agent is universal for all combinations, whether with matter or without matter: excepting two combinations, which are the hot combination without matter, and the dry combination without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In terms of heat and dryness with matter, they differ.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the cauterizing agent is beneficial in those cases.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite to this, namely that the cauterizing agent is not suitable in dryness, which comes from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient that one should heal from a hot and dry condition with something that is also hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And the one who says the opposite argued that when you compare a human body and its moisture to the nature of fire, you find that a human body is cold. And he said further that by means of cauterization, benefit happens in every kind of dryness which comes from heat affecting humans' bodies: for when you take into account a human body and its moisture compared to the nature of fire, you find out that the human body is cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed I say this through his argument, because I have seen that from experience this is often the case.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not apply it to this unless they have already been proven and exercised in the final chapter on the cauterizing process, and have learned about the diversity of human compositions, the nature of illnesses within themselves, their causes, the circumstances surrounding them, and the duration of those conditions.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	As for the other compositions, there is no fear to you regarding these: particularly in conditions of coldness and moisture.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Indeed, all the doctors have agreed on these matters: and they did not differ on the benefit of cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know that from the secret of healing through a cautery with fire, and the goodness of it compared to a cautery with burning medicine: because fire is simple, its action does not reach unless towards the member that is being cauterized: and it does not harm another member connected to it, unless by a small damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	Indeed, the action of medicine that burns reaches out to that which is extended from the limbs: and perhaps it causes difficult healing illnesses to occur in the body, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, due to its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed, through experience, we have come to understand this because of the depth and dedication in studying with expertise, and our position above truthfulness in matters: and due to that, we are excused from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not the case, because this does not fit within my book, I would reveal to you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies through their expulsion, which expels illnesses with philosophical demonstrative speech that would be enlightening for your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know my children, that they disagree during the time when it should be done for a cautery to take place, and they put forward better times of truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cautery suits at any time: therefore, the damage caused by time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn towards the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if a cautery is done due to pains from necessary, strong, sudden ones which do not tolerate delay: therefore, because it is feared that something worse might happen than the small harm caused by time's unavailability.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it be in your minds, my sons, this notion that is rejected by no one except for the vulgar and dull doctors, namely that sickness which can be cured by cautery does not always return. And they assume that the result is different than what they think: because cautery is not a replacement for medicine, which alters the composition, and expels moisture which causes problems leading to pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery is indeed beneficial over medicine due to the rapidity of his health and the strength of his treatment, and the vastness of his dominion: it's possible that illness may return at some point during his constitution, according to the weakness of the patient, and the nature of their illness, and its strength. And what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of surplus there: and what comes to them in acquisition through food, and similar things through the causes, unless it becomes an illness where cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle illness in a few surplus and moisture parts like in teeth cautery for toothache, and similar ones, it is possible that this pain does not return to him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But it's also the discourse of the crowd, stating that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct discourse: not towards what they aim for in it. For they believe there is no cure which comes with medicine, nor after the end of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, it's contrary to that and their intent; the notion that cautery is the last resort of medicine isn't true unless when we used methods of cure in any illness and those medicines didn't apply. Then later on we used cautery at the end of the process and it did apply: thus there arises the idea that cautery is the last resort of medicine, which doesn't correspond to what the crowd and many dull doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	Ancient people said that a cautery with gold is better than one with iron. And they said this not just because of the value of gold and its substance but also because it does not create pus at the site of the cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, it is not absolutely true: for I have already tested this and found that it does not make that happen in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with this is good and better than one with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery with fire made from gold, it is not revealed to you when it heats according to your desire due to the color of the gold: and when it reaches its cooling point, and if you add a fire over it, it liquifies in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into employment from that: and because of this, we have a cautery with iron instead which is quicker and closer to operations, in accordance with its purpose.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have already organized this chapter on the cautery according to sections, and arranged those from head to foot so that someone seeking what they want can find it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Section: On the method of cauterization in the coronal union.
Caput II.	Title II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Compare here the cauterization against the dominion of humidity and coldness on the brain: these are two causes of swelling, and many flows of humor from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and many symptoms of drowsiness, toothache, and throat pain, and generally all sicknesses which occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases resulting from illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick: for it is necessary that in the first place with a restorative medicated wash, their head be cleansed over three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a new razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Next have him sit between your hands in a square formation, so that his hands are now on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Next place the base of your palm over the base of their nose between their eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	And wherever your middle finger therefore explores, mark that spot with an unheated tool.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Next apply the Oil of Cauterization: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked spot with an unheated tool, applying pressure that you gradually increase by your hand, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Next quickly raise your hand and observe the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that an amount of alkali has escaped from the bone or an amount of herbs, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, apply your hand repeatedly with a hot iron or when cooled by another tool until you see the bones as I have told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, immerse the head, and place it over the spot; and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the butter-soaked head on it and let him go over the spot until the scab is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with the fourfold balsam ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus is emitted. Therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone and that the cauterizing tool should be kept until it heats something of thickness from the bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after what is burnt off from the bone, it is cured afterwards.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be done until the cauterizing tool reaches all the way to where an impression is made in the bone, so that the end of the bone drops and forms like a shape from a carving: or an instrument that women place immersed which is somewhat similar to the alphabet. And they believe that gases emerge from this location around the head, and the wound should be kept open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cured until it has consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cauterization do not seem entirely different except for certain individuals according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And letting it heal naturally, as far as I'm concerned, is better for the health of the individual.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	Indeed, the head weakens from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified with regard to other body parts; and especially when the head itself is naturally weak. And the first kind of cauterization is more beneficial and better for me, and I rely on it, so I use it accordingly in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The method of cauterizing the head when there is pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head: and this lasts in the sick person, and they use herbs, baths, head washes, oils, and fomentations.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery as we have narrated, and there is nothing from those that does not fit it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	And if the head is of a robust nature, it is not weak, and finds a sudden coldness: then cauterize with another cautery under that slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over every horn of its head with a cautery, so that the skin does not be disturbed, and discover from the bone the quantity that we have narrated.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with one cautery at the top of its head, in the place that is called a groove: and there is a spot where the windpipe is placed: and raise your blade here, and you will not expose the mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	Indeed, it finds intense pain due to this, and differs from the pain of other more cauterized heads.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this about the cautery: and it should be a cautery used for cauterizing horns of the head, and the back of its head should require a finer cautery for cauterizing the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	¶ On the method of cauterization for hemicrania, whether with heated medicine or with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there occurs pain and swelling in part of the head, or when the pain extends up to the eye, and it is treated with purging medicines for the head, and other treatments are administered as previously described in the divisions of illnesses, but does not encompass all aspects; then cauterization is done according to two methods: either cauterization using a burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery, when used with sharp medicine, is as follows: you should take one tooth from the alveolus, and remove its cortex, then sever its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Next, divide the pain area during bleeding with a wide cup until a spot beneath the skin is made, where the tooth will be extracted.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore introduce him inside under the skin until it is hidden: then bind it above with a constriction suitable for the swelling; and let him rest fifteen hours afterwards dissolve the bandage, and extract garlic and leave him for two or three days. Then place on top a cloth soaked in butter until pus forms: and care him with ointment until he is fully recovered.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in my twelfth treatise on medical remedies.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cautery treatment for it with iron is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Cautery by fire, which has this form.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is named Clavius: because the shape of its head resembles that of a key, having some curvature and there is a small elevation in the middle of it.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the spot and hold your hand. And you should move the iron gradually with speed: and let there be a quantity being burnt as thick as its middle part is, according to the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that it does not burn the artery which is below, and there is a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cloth in salt water and place it over the spot, then let him rest for three days. Then place the cloth with butter on top of it. And care him with ointment until he is fully recovered.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you have a case of half-head disease, cauterize this hemi-craniectomy with the second surgical incision method of cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And from the arterial incision in this hemi-head, not the old proper one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterization for the ancient half-head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a half-head ailment, with what we have discussed from the previous cure, and what we have said in divisions of illnesses, and if this treatment is not effective: then you will observe from the illness that what was stated from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, does not suffice. And when you see symptoms arising from the illness that indicate it's insufficient, namely that which we described when applying the first method of cautery, then it is necessary to use the second surgical incision method of cautery Cauterii until the affected area turns white after marks appear above the pain line. The length of this mark should be half a finger or somewhat like that: and hold your hand still for one moment, pressing it until you reach an artery, and continue until you have reached the opening.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to avoid burning the side of the jaw that moves during chewing, or the nerve that moves it, so as not to cause cramps.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be vigilant and take care of the blood flow from the artery that has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, during the severance of this (artery), there is a fear, and especially for the one who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or experienced: and he lets the operation go from him at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I advise with the recall of the regulation of blood flow accidents from the artery according to its own method, and in this place of the book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you observe an illness from which the person does not recover with this cautery, and if you see the weak body enduring the cautery in the middle of the head, as we described, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you observe the need, administer the cautery as we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery when using a cautery with two scalpels.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this reason, the cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ On the method of applying a cautery in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs due to cold and the symptoms are alleviated after rinsing with warm water, along with other treatments that we mentioned for its division, and if the pain does not subside, then apply the cautery: this is called the 'Punctum', which has this shape.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make the puncture(s) around the entire area of the ear, as indicated: or around both sides if pain occurs in both ears simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend it with the cautery from the base of the ear slightly, after marking the spots with a heated probe: and let the number of cautery marks be ten throughout each ear, as if that were the case.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	And then attend to those areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	§ On the method of applying a cautery in the case of torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The type of torture that is healed with cautery is only due to conditions originating from phlegm, as we described in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And apply the appropriate cautery for the condition that occurs due to dryness and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When treatments for this form of surgery involve the use of herbs, and gargles, and not yielding results with your treatment, then you should cauterize the patient using three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, and a second slightly below its proper time, and a third at the junction of both lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the weaker side opposite the affected area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because healing does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is to apply the cautery with it directly on the tip of the upper ear below the horn of the head, a little inward. And do this again at another time; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until the amount equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it resembles a knife, as its previous description shows. However, it should not be thinner by much, as you see; and there must be a knife that has an excess width somewhat.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then attend to the areas affected by this, until they heal completely.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	[The instruction begins on how to perform cauterization in cases of old apoplexy.]
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy is advanced and your treatment does not yield results as described, and the patient does not have a fever, then apply four cauteries over all of his or her horns (or bones), and use a cautery in the middle of the head as previously explained, and a cautery at the back of the head according to what has preceded: and the degree of the cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Even cautery is done with a cauterizing tool on the mouth of the stomach: and it is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then clean it, as what precedes it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Section: On the manner of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	Title IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the mouth one inserts first a large piece of masticatory wax, and a pill to purify the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Next cut the entire head of the sick person, and place on their scalp the plaster described for the use of saffron in the plaster treatise. And apply it occasionally.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	Indeed, that is the measure of the cauterizer: and do this according to the same order that I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed by this means, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then do three types of cautery on the posterior part of his head, which is descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery a thickness equal to that of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Next care for the cauterizer as what has preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however one adds to it and the sick person is able to tolerate that: then do the cauterizer on the middle part.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you want an addition, then cauterize him over the two horns (of the skull).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him until he is healed: and apply the cauterizer with oil according to the form that has been provided.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Section: On the manner of cauterizing in Paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Title X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head using wax and as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then cut the sick person's head: afterwards, apply a cautery to it in the middle of the head, and over every horn of the head, and over its posterior part, and three times on the cervical vertebrae.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If you are lacking in the comfort of body from many such illnesses and it is a sick person enduring them strongly: then apply four cauteries over the cervical vertebrae, and with the last one, keep applying until a large amount of skin burns off, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then take care of it, until it is healed: and thus apply the oil cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	¶ Concerning the method of applying the cautery in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	Epileptic does not need cautery, unless it is the one whose epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, you must purify his brain first when he is sick, and with the rest of the treatment we have mentioned in the division: when the patient is large, or endures the taste of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then gargling and brain purifying mastications are administered before many days with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then cut his head off, afterwards apply a single cautery to it in the middle of the head as previously instructed in method. And another cautery on his backside, and over every horn of his head with yet another cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and can endure it, then apply the cauteries I have mentioned in the case of paralysis, and body softening over the cervical vertebrae and back vertebrae. And let it be an oil cautery according to the method that has been given beforehand.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If the patient is a child, then apply a delicate cautery in accordance with this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cauterization in Melancholia.
Caput XII.	Head 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholia is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then apply the cautery upon it, which we have described for one who has palsy.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholia is excess descending to melancholy and the body is moistened, then give him a drink that purifies his brain, as prescribed in the division: then shave the sick person's head, and make afterwards a neat bandage made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and have the sick person supported square from every part while sitting.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more suitable made from old goat's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm him up with the heat of the fire tempered to a measure that he can tolerate when it is inserted into him.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate him in the middle of his head within a circle, and let him go until he cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Perform this for the sick person once every week, with his regular treatment being beneficial, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, perform the cautery by making numerous small punctures, and while holding your hand with the cautery: indeed, let there be a smell from it.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	This is because this appearance of the cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place on it a cloth that has been soaked in old butter or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the method of cauterization when descending into water for the eye.
Caput XIII.	Head十三
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water in the eye is shown to you through the signs I mentioned in division, then start and administer it to the patient, with whatever will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moisture and make him sit in a bath, fasting for certain days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then, if the descent of water has occurred in both eyes simultaneously: cauterize him twice, each time with two administrations, or from one side if it has occurred in only one eye. Remove all nerves and arteries under the skin with the cautery: let the cauterization be long in width like the time periods, and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then immediately remove whatever is possible with any available medicine. I practice with wisdom when dealing with removal of arteries and their severing, and caution against blood flow.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized at the neck, under two bones, with two final applications of cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterization using old tear ducts.
Caput XIIII.	Head XIV
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are abundant and they cover veins and arteries that are outside the manifest head (the area visible externally), it is determined that this results from excess cold phlegm. In such cases, cauterization should be performed using the same method as I described for the onset of water descending, the cauterization in the middle of the head, with two applications of cautery at intervals of two time periods, and twice at the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you are short-sighted due to addition, then cauterize him on all sides around the eyes, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Regarding the method of cauterization during the smell of Naso's womb.
Caput XV.	Title XV.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you are treating that, along with what we have mentioned about division, and the treatment doesn't match: then hasten, and administer three nights of an infusion of dry coxcombs. Then shave its head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, using an oily cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a 'claw' shaped cautery using two cauterizations, above the two eyebrows slightly above the hair.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, do not hit it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	This is the form of the cautery 'Clavi'.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Regarding the method of cauterization during the softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Title XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye softens due to illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if it's water, cauterize it slightly above the two eyebrows with two cauterizations in every part: and stretch them by two hours: and let the length of all cauterizations be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not finish your hand with the cautery instead, according to the quantity that burns the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	This is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Regarding the method of cauterization when the eyelashes are turned in and irritate the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery operates in two manners according to two methods: either the cautery with fire or the cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the case of a cautery with fire, it is advised that the patient first removes his hair, if there are any among them who cleanse them, until they extend and align.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they pierce him at his rise: then bind his eyes with the blindfold so that they do not move until birth.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When then they are born and aligned, then place the patient's head on your breast: afterwards mark over his eyelids with a heated tool, a mark that should resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of this mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place it soaked with albumen on the eye: or on the eye with psyllium mucus.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Next, you use a cautery of this form, using fire.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then apply the cautery to the figure you marked gradually in many places, until the entire visible surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is burned completely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your work's health is: if you can see that the eyelids of the eye have now contracted, and hair has been raised at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift your hand then: and let him go free for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then apply Butter to him over it until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Next, care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then reapply the cautery to that place as you did initially.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If they are hairs at the lower part: then cauterize them until they reach their natural place: and level them so that they do not prick the eyes.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	The method for cauterization when using burning medicine in this situation.
Caput XVIII.	Title XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you should instruct the sick person to remove the hairs until they extend and level off.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make it so that from the cloth of the material, the shape of a leaf of myrtle is formed.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from sandalwood that has not absorbed water, the weight of an ounce or approximately this: then grind these together with good grinding, and make this process while stirring it, so as not to cool it.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread out from it on the sheet you made like the shape of a leaf of myrtle, and place it over the eyelid(s) of one or two eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a piece of cotton soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be on your breast.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it moderately.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the patient feels the irritation of the medicine, because its touch is like that of fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	So long as he continues to experience the touch that he has discovered as irritating, then release the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the irritation ceases, then remove the medicine, and rinse the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Then examine if you see the eyelid lifting like during contraction with fire or incision; it is good: and if not, then repeatedly apply medicine over that spot where the medicine does not stick, without damaging, until your operation has been completed and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place over it butter with the skin, until the dry skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Next, care for him with the balsamic ointment or another, until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation, to keep your final vigilance, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid becomes soft after a day and something from the hair irritates the eye, then apply the medicine repeatedly to that place on the lid that is softening properly, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you will know that the size and fineness of human eyes vary.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, consider this accordingly: and do not hide the path of rectitude for him who has a zeal for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	§ On the method of cauterization in lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Title XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat the fistula, according to what we said about divisions of illnesses, and if your treatment is not effective: then, it should be necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom and have them hold their head minister (a small stool or bench) between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shift when holding their own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the infused Butta on the eyelid or over the eye with a mucus from egg whites, or with a mucus of psyllium: then apply the cautery instrument, which has this form.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let the cone be, as the shape of a reed's feather with the point cut by one tool from its extremity, just like when making a cauterizer: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if your tool wishes to go upwards, try this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	But this cone is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the窦 (fistula) if it is open, and extract pus from it and cleanse it; and if it is not open, then open it up and remove its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the then onto it Cauterium (cauterizer), which is made to burn intensely.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it close to the Cauterium near the eye, up to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: and place the Cauterium on the fatty part of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you have reached the beginning of your cauterizer up to the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then apply the cauterizer once, or twice if you need it: and let that heal for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place the Cotum (possibly referring to a dressing or ointment) with butter, and take care of it with an ointment for drying until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days pass and he does not heal: then place over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the mouth is uncovered: and cut it according to how it reaches into its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method for the cauterization of a窦 (fistula), which some said at first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Go to the site of the窦 (fistula), and open it up. Then place a fine tool, that is, a slender cannula, into this opening. The form of this is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of drachms of melted lead, and hold your hand with the good Canna retention, and the sick person must not move at all, so that no running or any liquidified lead reaches his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary for you to place on the sick person's eye a solution in milk, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with marvellous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	And what if the fistula is healed, along with what we said about cautery and healing, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to apply the nostril opening, and to direct the fistula back into its own course through the nose, according to how it will find itself at its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Section on the method of cautering in clefts of the lips.
Caput XX.	Title XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times there occur clefts in the lips which they call hairs, and especially in children's lips.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	And when you care for these clefts, as we said about the division of complaints, and if there is no effective treatment, then apply a small cautery by fire according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it already ignited hastily within the clefts, until the cautery reaches deep into the clefts.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Afterwards care for it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Section on the method of cautering in an orifice of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Title XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of teeth: then pus is formed and ruptures. Afterwards it coagulates and pus runs out, and a fistula forms. Then one should treat that area, and not accumulate treatment there; thus, when required, use hot cautery according to what quantity it absorbs in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the glowing object into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated metal reaches its depth, and the final part of it. Do this once, or twice at intervals.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then continue to treat it after that, as we have described the treatment until when it is treated.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore pus is removed and healing occurs, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it will be necessary to uncover the location and remove the putrid mouth according to what comes at its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	¶ On the method of applying cautery to gums, and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes softened due to moisture and teeth begin to move, and you treat it with medicines without accumulating treatment: then place the head of the patient in your bosom.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the hot cautery which will take this form afterwards, so that you place a tube over the tooth and introduce the glowing cautery into it. And hold your hand slightly there until the patient feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the teeth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand: then apply the cautery several times, according to what you desire.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	Indeed, the tooth is set in motion, and the gum is softened and tightened, and moisture that has become spoiled is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Regarding the manner of cauterizing in dental pain.
Caput XXIII.	Title XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness within the tooth itself, or a worm, and when treatment with medicines does not alleviate it, then cautery on the tooth is done in two ways: either with buttered cautery; or with an iron cautery.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter is as follows: take the heated butter and apply it to the bulla, either in a copper funnel or on a dressing.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take some cotton, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse this in heated butter: and place it on the painful tooth as quickly as possible, hold it until it cools down: then repeat this several times, until the power of heat reaches the root of the teeth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and place the heated iron over it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery with fire is done by aiming at an air tube or a metal tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of thickness within its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the weak mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then the fire cautery, whose form it will take: place it over that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this repeatedly, for the pain is alleviated, or on that same day, or the following day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary for the patient to fill the mouth of that cautery with a good wick and hold it for one hour. Then he should expel it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Apply the cautery with whatever extremity is possible according to what can be done: and this is the form of a cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Section on the method of applying cautery in strophiles.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophiles are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to treatments for digestion through medicines, and increase the rate of digestion: then shape a cauterizing instrument with this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke escapes from one end at the cauterizing point through the other end: and place the ignited object once on the blister, and if needed a second time until it reaches to the bottom of the blister.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the blister is small, then place the cauterizer according to the size of the blister.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then release it for three days, and place on it an infusion in butter until what was burnt by the fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with the salve of the teeth until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Section on the method of applying cautery for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humors accumulate over the bronchial canal, especially when this is associated with a cold constitution, then it must be treated initially with dissolved medicines by the patient.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize him at the base of his throat above the depression: and be careful not to reach with the cauterizing instrument either into the throat or onto the skin, unless something prevents it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize him with the cauterizing instrument at the junction of the neck and the last vertebrae of his neck by removing it to the end. And make sure that the cauterizing tool is like a key according to the manner of the one that preceded it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with whatever has gone before until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	In the manner of cauterization for pulmonary diseases and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When the cough and pulmonary discomfort are caused by cold moisture, and the patient does not have fever, tuberculosis, or an old discomfort: then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the windpipe in depressed areas, gently, vacantly.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And use another cauterizing instrument in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and make sure the cauterization is like the shape that went before, resembling a cannula.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish to perform your cauterization by puncturing with a cauterizing tool known as 'Punctum', which has the form that precedes it when puncturing ear pain, and have the punctures made from thirty points up until about elsewhere.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with what has been prescribed previously, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cauterization have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, when you treat him with that cauterization, do so in place of one single three-pronged cauterizing tool.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	In the method of cauterization for syphilis (Titillicus), and in shoulder joint dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Title XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to moisture and does not settle back into its original position during its returning time after the dislocation, until it has that habit of returning for him, then when a slight movement dislocates it as we have already testified that thing, then you must return the dislocation in the first place.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is enveloped or wrapped on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin which is inside the Ulna up to your superior left hand fingers and if the articulation gets dislocated towards the interior.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having two wicks with fire, I hold the cautery tool.
Cuius forma est haec.	The shape of which is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side of the limb, and you will achieve a figure resembling four cautery marks.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a tool that has three wicks, for then there appears a figure of six like those made by three cauterizations: and they are wicks according to the fineness of the test.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	This is the shape of the cautery tool that has three wicks.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes an additional method is added to this one, so there are eight cauteries in total.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place the ground-up stalks with salt on top of the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then ensure that the patient remains calm so that no part of their limb moves at any time until they are comfortable.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the top and this happens rarely, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a triangular cautery or with many-pointed cauterizations.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the connection becomes strong and the moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Title XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When coldness and abundant moisture occur in the stomach until it is separated from its composition, and catarrhs increase towards it, and there are frequent methods of treatment without much effect: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then apply with three cauterizations, one as large as the width of a finger under the cochlea of the chest, and one similar to the clavicle in size. Apply two further cauterizations below these, each from the edge of one cauterization, until you obtain the figure of a triangular shape after the cauterizations have healed.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch between the two so that they do not join when pus is being produced.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be equal to the thickness of two-thirds of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauterizations be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cauterization in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let there be one cauterization that makes this cauterization according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with one that trembles from this cauterization: and as you draw signs over the stomach's puncture according to the amount you can do with a cautery: then cauterize it again with the point cauterization: and then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the method of cauterizing the cold exterior (Epar).
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When an occurrence of pain in the shoulder blade is due to coldness and moisture, or from a heavy wind, until it escapes from its natural disposition of excess discharge, and when the patient recovers as we have said, but does not benefit in that situation: then the patient must be supported on their neck, and with an cautery three applications of cauterization according to this figure, and this quantity below Epar's area at the point where the human arm enters from the hypochondriac region: and there should be space between every application according to the thickness of a finger: and the cauterization should be as long as the body itself is in straight line: and do not apply your hand with the cautery for too long.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let there be the quantity of what is burnt due to the thickness of the skin, half the quantity not added: and let the patient stand on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however they are not standing, then let them be lying down, who have already stretched out their legs, and raised their arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed, it is possible for you to apply these types of cautery with a surgical knife when you have skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too far in cautery and burn the thickness of the skin throughout, causing the whole body to be burned, which reaches the intestines: since there is thinness there, know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Section on how to perform cautery for boils in the shoulder blade region.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there is an exiture, and you need to know if that boil is located within the flesh of the shoulder blade or on its covering tissue: then if it's in the flesh of the shoulder blade, the patient will experience pain and heaviness without sharpness: and if it's within the covering tissue of the shoulder blade, there is a sudden sharpness with pain. And you can see that it has tired out his doctors' treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the patient should supinate his/her neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then draw the place for applying the cautery with an iron: then use the lamp that is compared to a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And when using it to cauterize with the cautery, continue until the whole skin burns up, and penetrate through to the siphon, until all the pus comes out: then take care of itself in the healing process until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for me to use this type of cautery, except for those who have a deep interest in the medical art: and when these illnesses come together with their experience often: then he should dare upon such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But rather to dismiss her, for me it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Section: On the method of cauterization for Pleuresis (a disease of the pleura).
Caput XXXI.	Title Thirty-One.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The old ones said that the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold Pleuresis according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is like this: you should take one of the longer roots from dry Aristolochia, a root that can be found there, and it should be about the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and then light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then use one cautery to cauterize the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck, and with two smaller cauteries at an incline, apply them slightly below the part where the beard is.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries at an incline on the area between the 5th and 6th ribs towards the back slightly. And another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And for three cauterizations from behind: one where there are between two spoons; and two cauterizations from the two sides of the chest, lower cauterization which is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it should not be that you compress your hand with the cautery, but there should be an evident smell of the skin while doing so.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery similar to a rod made of iron; they heat it, and then insert it into the space between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, until it comes out clean: just as we described in Epi's abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this puncture with the cautery, there is a risk that either the patient dies immediately, or a sinus occurs in the place, which cannot be healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ On the method of cauterization for the Splenic Node Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat spleen ailments, as we have discussed for the treatment of diseases by division, if your cure does not work, then there is a cautery on that according to three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is, to make three or four lines in a row according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cautery that precedes it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery a thickness like that of a finger, or somewhat more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the method of applying the cautery should be the same as we described for the cautery on Epi's (the spleen).
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and have the patient lying supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method for cautery is: having two true fire-cauteries as we described in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift up the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left arm reaches. And let your lifting be according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall longitudinally according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two lit candles inside, until you penetrate the skin from one side. Then remove the cautery instrument: hence, four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery and three wicks.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then after you let the cautery out to discharge pus for many days, it is because it is more effective than the rest which preceded from the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	¶ Regarding the method of cauterization in hydrocele.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall into hydrocele, unless it is specifically asclitic [which likely refers to a specific type of hydrocele].
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat hydrocele with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in our division, and if the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one single cautery over the stomach, another over the epar (which could refer to a specific anatomical area), and one over the spleen, and two cauterizations after the back between the ribs, and one directly in the chest, and another directly over the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be as close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cautery so that it discharges pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the patient from treatment after the cautery with it: what needs to be done is that two intentions should unite in this case: and he will hasten towards its healing with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	But the shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be a key: according to its preceding shape; and for that one with which the back is cauterized, it should be an olive, according to its preceding shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the manner of applying cautery to feet and thighs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When blisters occur in Hydrophilic patients, and become filled with yellowish water: you must apply the cautery on the heel of the foot at a spot which is between the outer ear and the ankle. And raise your hand with the cautery, without twisting it. Then raise your hand again, and don't go back to that spot completely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water remains and according to this form apply the cautery.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then, apply two cauteries on each of the two thighs in every thigh area. Do this with a cauterizer with an end similar to a knife tip. The cauterization should be in accordance with the length of the thigh, one below the knee joint and another slightly lower than the middle part of the thigh. Apply two cauteries over all hip joints. Let the open cauterizer heal without treatment for some time until some water remains from it. Then treat it along with what we have previously discussed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of applying cautery in a solution for the stomach.
Caput XXXV.	Title XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a stomach solution due to cold and moisture until the retaining and digesting powers which are in the stomach and intestines become weak; treat this condition according to the methods of treatment, not allowing it to heal. You will see an infirm person tolerating excessive vigor from the cauterization, then apply a large cautery over their stomach with what was used previously for stomach cautery using a circular method. Apply four small ring-like cauteries around the umbilicus, and a thin triangular cautery underneath. Then apply a large one on the navel or use two cauterizations above it.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and an infirm person tolerating this, then apply the cauterization over the ribs with a large cautery, and over all parts of his body. You might also add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For indeed, the healing is successful, whose aid never fails.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	关于如何灼烧痔疮的方法。
Caput XXXVI.	Title XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from thick, cold, or damp fluids, and when they are treated with what we said in division (presumably referring to a previous section of the text), but do not yield effective treatment: then apply three cauteries on the lower vertebral line beneath the navel, roughly triangularly cut into parts, and apply a cautery under the belly button as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach has been cooled and his food is not being digested, and you see that he looks pale, then apply a large cautery over the stomach according to what precedes, and with a cauterizing instrument over his spleen, and another over his liver with an arm-shaped cauterizing instrument: and remove the open cauterization at some point in time. Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Regarding the method of applying cautery to an althel (a type of abscess) after its removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Title XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove an althel (a type of abscess), then apply the cautery that is similar to a radius [or rod].
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited instrument into the removed althel (a type of abscess): and continue your hand until the cautery reaches the opening from which blood runs: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many althels (abscesses), then apply each with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what yields help from ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you apply a large cautery to it, it is more effective for improvement.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The method of applying the cautery to an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not comply with the division and operation that we described in its proper place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	And when there arises a Fistula in someone, and it is old, pus flows from it and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, what should be done is to probe it with a slender instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then, ascertain the depth of its depth with your prodding.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Next, apply the cautery, which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then, insert yourself, burning, into the Fistula and determine how deep the tip has gone.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need's necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And protect yourself from the irritation of nerves, if there are any, or large veins: Or if the fistula goes to the bladder body, or to the intestinal body, then protect yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform that if the fistula is in a fleshy area: and you think, because it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the area seals and materials are removed from it, and a situation lasts for a long time: then you will know that it has been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials do not detach from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or the depth of its opening is corrupted, or somewhat like this comes out from there: whose memory will occur in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Title XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or heavy winds, and it diminishes because of that which makes people weak, then you should cauterize him over the middle of his own kidneys, with a cauterizing tool over the entire kidney and using a cautery stick. Then recall that this is followed by a reminder.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize him again at the second location on his own middle part.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come out.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they are more effective in recovery.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Title XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to coldness and moisture until the unwell person does not retain urine, then cauterize him at the lower part of the middle on the bladder, where the hairs are starting, and with a cauterizing tool from the right side suminis, and the other from the left side of that: let the length of that cauterization be across like the width of a knuckle: and cauterize him in the inferior back or with two cauterizations if it requires that: and let it follow a preceding cauterization by the stick.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Title XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and moisture occur in the uterus, and it is prohibited by that from conception, and her menstruation is corrupted, and the induction of them occurs late, and a pain occurs to her just at their arrival, then it must be cauterized with three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as we said about the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cauterizing tool on the lower part of the abdomen or back. And let there be the cauterization by stick.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the ankh in the event of dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Title XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moist mucus extends to the ankh and causes its exit from its place, and the sign of this is that the shinbone extends over the other when they are brought together; and the location of dislocation is found within it as empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, you must cauterize the weak spot above the ankh of the affected person with a similar circular cautery: after marking it with the iron around the circumference of the bone, as it revolves, and let it fall upon the middle of the circle itself.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And make the shape of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	And if you do not have this cautery present, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large oil-based cautery. And make the depth of the cautery according to the thickness of the entire skin's quantity.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Title XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When a pain occurs in the shinbone of the ankh, and the cause is cold and moisture: and when the patient is treated with it as we said in division, but if the treatment does not cure and persists, then this continues: then you must release the patient from thick fluids using stinking pills or artificial pills, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him/her.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization for that is according to two methods: a cautery with heating substances, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire, is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One method is to apply the cautery over the surface of the instrument itself with three triangular burnings, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them have a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that is between every burning, equal to the thickness of a finger's width: and make them burn with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, sometimes the cautery is applied centrally on the head of the instrument itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore, there are four burnings.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you apply the cautery with a circular form, which precedes the burning shape of the dislocation of the instrument, do it once: so that there is a circle containing the entire length of the tool.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn through the thickness of all the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of the cautery for Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the instrument itself and does not extend until the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends until the thigh and leg, then apply two burnings over the thigh, over the place where the patient was bent, where there is pain, and your burning on a bone four fingers wide towards the tropical part. And let it be a surgical knife-like burning.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery correspond to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	And if the patient bends where the pain extends almost to the toes, then apply it there with a point-like burning, three, or four, or more if that is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the pain is bent beneath the knee towards the leg, then apply it there with a single surgical knife-like burning.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And do this for every act of your cautery, that you not finish with the cautery itself so as to burn nerves or great arteries, and thereby leave upon the sick man a harmful evil or constriction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one and another among those who have applied cautery to a stone above the knee joint, but finished with it in the cauterization process. As a result, there was swelling of the leg until a lump developed near the foot, and then the whole leg became completely perforated and rotten. Afterwards, there occurred a peritoneal rupture, and death followed this event.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is felt in both parts at the same time, apply cautery to both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise ones said that for the cautery of the ankle bone, this is the manner of its application.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron rod, whose diameter is half a palm's width. And make it so that its size at the place of entry matches approximately the thickness of a finger's nucleus, or slightly less than this. Inside this second rod, place another third rod.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between every rod be equal to the size of a knuckle's width. Make the rods open from both ends and give them heights like a knuckle or two knuckles high: and make handles out of iron that are off-center fitting into the rods.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then heat it in the fire until it turns red and sends out sparks. Afterwards, place it on a sand pile above the ankle bone of the sick person who is lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, apply three round cauteries to him once each in the shape of a horseshoe.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After applying ointments with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the balm until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, this form of cauterization, we do not often use it, due to the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because we find few who wait on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, among the good cauterizations, there is one that tolerates it and finds its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization with those who endure medicines is such that you make two samia containing perforated rings, into which the hinge of his door descends from the air or iron, the length being similar to the walls: there should be two nodes in their height, or they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is the quantity of two finger widths between them, and they should be open at the bottom and top: and let it contain itself towards each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place her over the patient's hip on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand onto the patient's hipbone much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles made from hot water, which should be heated with a little fire, and keep it for the duration of an hour: and the patient will endure its bite, and its drying, because he finds the bite like a flame until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the tool and wipe away the hot water from the hipbone along with sweet water: then let that be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it until the blackness of drying is removed: and leave that for a few days, and drain pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last in assistance.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or thigh, have him lie down in the water so that he is at equal height as you did when on the wide table.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is how to use warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on medical corrections.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take the alkali and ashes of both parts and mix them. Rub each one thoroughly and place them in a new jar whose bottom part has been pierced with a small hole according to the amount that will be added, its radius: and place under the base of the jar another treated jar; and remove the alkali and ashes from sweet water which should submerge both by about an inch. After this compress it with your hand until it is well compressed. And drain the jar until the sharp water reaches the bottom part of the treated jar.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then aggregate all that water and pour it over another piece of ash. And apply the heat until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	Indeed, then it will be of great sharpness which is used in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other body parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medical treatments, when they are cauterized on the large table like tesis and cardo, as well as jujube and soap, in such a way that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed recounted it in his writings about the treatment of a certain man according to ancient practices for the relief of pain in the hip and sciatic vein. And he praised its effectiveness greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that no other treatment is needed and that he was cured by one means alone, until then, because perhaps he had entered the bathhouse, and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it must be taken from the seat of the sore; and if green is not found there, take the dry, fresh one: and it should be ground much with a little fat, and placed on where pain is, or at the thigh, or in the hip: and it should be tied up, and left for three hours' worth, or as long as the patient finds the warmth of the application tolerable.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse him in the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	And when his body becomes moist, have him sit on the throne (referring to the surgical chair or bed).
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	The pain subsides and he heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you will know that no one should use any cautery with these remedies unless after bodily evacuation.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And as Dioscorides has said, that the dung of goats, when used to cauterize a sciatic vein, relieves it: and this is how the cautery should be performed.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	A piece of wool is taken, and soaked in old oil, then placed over the deep spot, which is located between the big toe and the instep, closer to the instep.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dried dung of goats, and ignite it in fire until charcoal is formed.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it over the wool and let it burn until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	And repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, do not stop doing that until the sensation reaches to the ankle and rest is felt, meaning the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Cautery of Goats (Vaccinum).
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Section on Cauterization of Back Pain
Caput XLIIII.	Title: 42nd Chapter
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back for many reasons, whether due to circumstances, impact, overabundance of evacuation, and similar issues, from the infusion of cold material and moisture: indeed, cautery falls only in this single kind where it is made from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, it is necessary after evacuating the patient with fetid pills and similar remedies, to make three lines across the back where there is pain, according to the width of half the circumference of the finger. After marking these lines with a burnishing tool, apply five burns or more depending on the quantity that comes out from the patient's tolerance by their virtue: and then perform cauterization using a cauterizing needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, perform cauterization with three or four burns, using a central key-shaped cauterizing tool, according to this shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	¶ Concerning the method of cauterization for the initial gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to young boys.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is this: a constriction occurs in breathing and movement upon him during evacuation, and you find at the last vertebra of the back and his nodes that it has begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	And when you see that and wish to do so, then cauterize him with a cauterizing tool that is circular according to this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And apply the cauterizer evenly over all parts of the vertebrae: and if you wish, cauterize around each vertebra with a needle-shaped tool in two lines or three: and make the points close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the site until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be cautious, do not apply the cauterizer to a bump that appears during nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of applying the cauterizer for gout and ligament pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold moist substances that flow to any part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, according to the custom of the doctors, they call this condition properly gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So when gout caused by cold factors is being treated with its methods and the pains do not subside, then apply the cauterizer to remove those pains.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you apply the cauterizer after defecation around the area of the foot joints, with multiple applications of the cauterizer: and use an olive oil-based cauterizer.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is how it is done.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make marks on the face of the foot, then do so with the point of the cauterizer.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints and this happens frequently, then apply the cauterizer over each knee three times, or four times from every side, using the same cauterizer called 'Clavi'.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	And if you need to use more of this cauterizer, then apply it as needed.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand in the cauterizer, rather keep its thickness about as thick as skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	And if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then apply what we have instructed from the cauterizer in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then perforations should be made around the wrist, as two lines are said to be turned there.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If the pains still persist in the fingers, then punctures should be made over each knuckle point and also over the palmar ridge of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then apply cautery from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not discharge the patient from good treatment, due to intolerance of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good care is done and the phlegm is discharged with this cautery, God willing, it will be cured with this aid.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of applying cautery to Wounds.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and if that starts close by: then it is necessary to immediately relieve the swelling in its own day for the sick person.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And use the softer ones, from which feces will descend from his stomach.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until he exhales, or until the spermatic cord or intestine becomes visible.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then guide him back with your fingers and apply the cautery under the rupture on the palmar ridge in the shape of a mark whose end is similar to half the size of a circle, towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery with this form until it produces white fluid and discharges pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then guide the intestine or the spermatic cord back to its natural position.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then have the attendant place their hand on the location so that nothing escapes out of the intestines: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a bolster under it, and serving one is above his legs, and another serves him on his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cauterizer over it at the mark, with your hand holding the cauterizer in line straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold the person until you follow him with the mouth: or repeatedly alternate with another if you have not followed him from the beginning up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization period, so as not to burn it and allow it to escape through that above the patient resulting in either death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And you should know that when you do not follow with the instrument during your cauterization, your operation is ineffective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it must be that the children's cauterizer is delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the rest of the ointment until healing occurs.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide the food of its length during the healing time which soothes its stomach: so that nothing escapes out of the intestines at defecation and diarrhea.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when it desires to stand after forty days, then administer a ligature made from the center and have him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be relieved of labor, overeating with food and drink, and from harsh commands.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, then it results in a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak about the treatment of wounds with cutting in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When indeed wounds occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are beginning ones, and useful for not increasing, then cauterize the wound with a round cautery according to its size: let that which is burned be like one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it, with what we have said: and do not allow its addition.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said about the first ones: that the wound should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After marking with the hot iron, and placing a line which is across the width on the upper side of the wound, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand with the triangular cautery in the middle.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	§ On the method of cauterization in pain due to condition, or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	Title 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some limbs due to accident or impact causing pain; and that pain persists for a long time, and there is no healing with the doctors: then it must be cauterized with a punctum cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the size of each member's cautery be according to its magnitude, and its thickness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it heals with the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then apply successive additional cauterizations.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For the custom of these pains is that they alternate from one member to another as it approaches them.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it must be that you continue with them until the patient is healed with the use of cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of using cautery for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Head 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, leprosy sometimes benefits from the maximum therapeutic use of cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that results from phlegm and melancholy putrefaction: therefore, consider how to use the force of cautery against it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore leprosy is spreading and you have treated it according to what we said in the division, and it doesn't subside or stabilize: then consider when the corruption affects the entire composition of his body. Then apply cautery to him on the head over five applications: one centrally at the top of the head, and the second lower towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two more above that, and a fifth one behind the neck bones.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And the final application of your hand with cautery is until it leaves a small imprint in the mouth and causes the thick fumes to be expelled from there. Then apply further treatment by applying the cautery even on the spleen, following what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	And if the leprosy is already spread out on the patient and is clearly visible: then you should apply these cauteries as we described in the head section, and the cautery to the end of the nose, and two applications each over two maxillary bones, and two over the cervical vertebrae, and six over the thoracic vertebras, and a large one at the base of the tailbone and one above it, on his navel: and two over the hips: namely, on all the hip bone with one, and over both knees: one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the forearms, and two over the tenderness in his chest: and apply the cautery to every seam, from the seams between his fingers of hands and feet, and their toes: and cauterize over all the heel of his feet, and the knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And touch the nerves which are above the very end of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cauterizer on the root of the molar tooth, and on another on the opening of the stomach, and on yet another on the tailbone.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cauterization, the more it will be beneficial and effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you will know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization as the healthy do; it is because their body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizations be of appropriate size and quality according to body parts and joints: following the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cauterization with herb flour mixed with honey, and other treatments, until the wound heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	In The Method of Cauterization Using Stupefaction.
Caput L.	Head L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain part becomes stunned and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then use cauterization on the stunned part, according to its size or quality.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And make your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization is used for a certain stupor that happens to the hand and foot, at the foramen of the spinal column where the nerves move this limb: and the stupor is relieved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	However, do not apply it without understanding anatomy of the body and the movement of nerves exiting the limbs, unless one is wise in this field.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Head 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When you are dealing with Albaras and there is nothing from the medical inventions in it: then apply deep cauterization on it temporarily, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of the hogweed, and pigeon's blood, and rabbit's blood: take one part from each. Mix all these together and spread them over a cloth, and apply them to the wound until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization in the Crab.
Caput LII.	Head 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the Crab is beginning, and you have placed it (the patient), then cauterize it with a circular cautery over its circumference as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise ones said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But to me it does not seem that way; because I fear it will fester, and I have seen this happen on several occasions.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And the better method is to cauterize it around its circumference as we said, or with multiple cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization for Abbevillians (Adubelati).
Caput LIII.	Head 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Abbevillians (Adubelati) and there is delay in maturing them, or due to excessive production causing it, or due to the age of the infirm person, when they are decrepit with little blood, or due to time and haste in maturing Adubelatis, then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then cut it off.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	And she will hasten with ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you make a puncture in it with a cautery, then use the cautery kindled by fire, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the prepared ashes until the skin penetrates: and let the cautery from what follows be weak, so that the flow of clean matter may be encouraged.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	¶ On the method of applying a cautery to a sore spot.
Caput LIIII.	Head 44.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A sore spot is nothing but corruption wandering within a limb, and it consumes the part: just as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a sore spot in a place that can withstand a cautery with fire, then use many small and large pincers of the cautery according to what suits the location where the sore is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then apply the cautery to all parts until you have eradicated the entire corruption, and there remains nothing at all from it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it heal for three days, and place over the areas that have been treated with a mixture of ground sulfur and oil until all the scabs and corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it using ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days, flesh is born with health, which lacks corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cautery repeatedly over what remains from the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a sore spot is treated with sharp medicine sometimes.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Indeed, it rises at the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	True, yet the cautery with fire is more expedient than it seems: and indeed I have already mentioned its use with acute medicine in division. Therefore, receive that procedure there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cautery in Clauws and Warts.
Caput LV.	Title LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment occurs many times in the lower parts of the feet: it is a large, filtered affliction which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	Indeed, there is cautery for them according to two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, it should be made like a pen puncher that is similar to bird peckers. It should be made of iron according to the size of the claw on every side, and have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated instrument upon the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then move the hand with the cautery around the area of the claw until the cautery reaches to the depth of the claw. Leave it for three days until pus begins to come out.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with rue poultice mixed and ground with salt, and leave the poultice on overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the site with a rejuvenating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they do not heal and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply cautery with hot water. And you will receive a tube from air, or iron, or from bird beaks: and place it over the claw or wart.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the cannula: keep your hand and move it with pressure from your hand, barely, so that an edge mark of the cannula is imprinted at the root of the clavicle, and let the warm water find a way to depth, to the root of the clavicle: and the patient should stay above the wound for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the clavus is removed along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this one by one until you have dealt with all that is within the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are removed, considering what grows from the substance of ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	### Method for Cauterization in Tremor (Tremble).
Caput LVI.	Title LVII.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremble happens to someone due to cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you apply four or five cauteries on the spinous processes of the back, and between each process with a cautery, and over his chest with a cautery, and over his stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Indeed, the tremble stops when an olive oil cautery is applied, and hastens the recovery from cold ailments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	### Method for Cauterization of Albathir
Caput LVII.	Title LVIII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes, impurities called Albathir (which refers to pus that forms from corrupted materials) are expelled from the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they become visible, they should be treated by applying a thin, fine cautery over each head of the pus lump, with one end of the stick of myrtle being ignited at the fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	And when it comes to the long root of the Aristolochia plant.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	And with the use of a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes the extremities are heated with a cautery at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase in size, but the excess is broken down as they make use of them, and they heal through them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after bloodletting with the phlebotomy procedure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Regarding the method of applying cautery during the flow of blood from an artery at the wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often blood flows from an artery which has been cut at the wound, whether it happens externally or at a cut by forceps, or a member's cautery, and similar to these: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when such a thing happens to someone, then immediately reach out with your hand towards the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it strongly until the blood is trapped under your finger and does not escape from there at all.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small pieces of olive oil-based cautery on fire and add many more: and blow over them until they burn intensely.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one or slightly less, or more depending on the wound and location where the artery was severed, place the cautery over that blood vessel, immediately after you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is released.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the blood is expelled as you raise your finger from the artery's opening and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those that are prepared on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to perform one after another until blood is expelled.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, do not set fire to the nerve there, and let some other mischief happen to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to sever it: especially if the artery is large, unless done with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or using a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract and blood is expelled.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or substances of medicinal properties may be placed upon it, which have the property of expelling blood, and then bound with a suitable compression using a pessary.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Those who perform the operation while binding it with a bandage and compressing it with cloth, or arranging things to burn together with similar ones, do not completely cut him off from this except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone and there is no doctor nor medicine available, then he should start by placing the tip of his index finger over the vein opening, as we have told you before, and applying intense compression, until blood is expelled from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved. Above it, apply cold water constantly, until it is frozen and congealed, then cut it off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, he should consider what needs to be done with the cautery or with medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	¶ Conclusion of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Piercing, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have discussed in the first chapter, every illness where it is appropriate to use a cautery and burning medicine, and its situations, causes of its occurrence, and tools for its application, as well as forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed the headings from head to foot there.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, to enlighten those who seek knowledge.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I start this, you need to learn about what is in this chapter that matches the fear mentioned in the first chapter on cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, there should be greater caution in it, since in the operation described in this chapter, bleeding occurs frequently with blood, which sustains life at the point of incision or pustule, or the opening of exit, or treatment of wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incision over a stone, and similar cases: from all these there arises trembling and fear, and death befalls many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you not to fall into that which causes hesitation, for sometimes such cases of people with illnesses occur within this art towards you.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there are those who become angry with their illness, and death is mild for them: due to the severity he finds from his illness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when sickness arises from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these comes the one who gives his medical treatment to you and enriches you with it, hoping for healing, but his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	One does not therefore need to agree with him who comes to you from them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your own rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not assume anything from it before a certain knowledge, which verifies that there is a commendable succession to what has been achieved.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use your care for the cure of all your patients, prediction and suggestion towards that which leads to proper health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this there is assistance for you towards the attainment of fame and glory, and remembrance and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, my children, his understanding, and not take away your guidance and inspiration: for that is within his power.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed, I have organized this chapter by dividing it into sections, following what was done in the chapter on cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that you can find and obtain what you desire from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of water which is added to infant's heads.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to infants after birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the baby without elevation.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also sometimes happens due to an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed, I have not seen this illness in others as in infants: and death has approached every one of them from it. Therefore, it seems to me appropriate for me to abstain from the treatment in such cases.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I have seen an infant with its head filled with water, and the head would swell every day until it could not sit on itself due to the size of its head; and the humidity increased until it died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this kind of moisture either accumulates between the skin and the mouth, or accumulates beneath the bone above the tooth.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation is as follows: if there is moisture between the skin and the mouth, and there is a slight abscess, then it should be that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one width, and let the length of the incision be roughly twice the size of two joints until the moisture drains.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a sputumill (a medical tool or device).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	And if the moisture is significantly increased and the abscess is larger, then place these two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the openings of the head cavities from all parts: and water is pressed when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and what you do not hide from you: then it should be that you make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove all the moisture completely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then stitch the incisions with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then wash that off with wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then release the bandage, and take care of the wound with dressings and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not release the head's stitches until they have reached their normal width.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient with all dry food that is slightly moistened, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And the other consideration for making an incision is to observe where the size of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes there is more at the back of the head, or at the top of the head, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascend with your cut where pus and filling of water become visible to you: and divide that according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not cut the artery and let blood flow out, causing the patient to die from that loss with water expulsion.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ On cutting arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone gets a cough affecting the eyes or chest and becomes unresponsive, and medical treatments are not effective: then, more so, the last resort is through cutting these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you need to cut them, the patient must shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a coarse cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Next, have the patient tighten their own neck with any piece of cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then observe, where the pulse beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	The locations of both are places that are below the ears and sunk down; they rarely get hidden, unless in certain individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark both locations with a hot wax: and cut both using two sharp needles until the cuts reach the mouth: and this should be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if necessary, insert the needles under the artery and cut it upwards with the cuts.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the cut be about the width of two fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when an artery is cut, blood flows out with each beat of the heart, which jumps into the inner parts frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however, the artery is not apparent to touch, then it must be measured from the ear by three finger-widths of space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then marks with the cautery, and proceed until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which needs to be discharged from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will discharge more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	Do the whole thing according to the quantity that appears to you from the disease of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then examine towards the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there is still something left towards the mouth from the siphon, then apply this so that no hot abscess forms: then bind the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the removal of arteries, which are found in the joints.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When this happens to a person with old half-headache, or acute cough due to harsh humidities, and heat in the joints of the limbs, or from old soda water and similar things: when treated according to methods of medical treatment, it does not yield this result; then we have these illnesses for extracting arteries from the joints, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	The method of action for extracting them is to shave the hairs that are in the joints and extend towards the apparent artery in the joint.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is revealed to you by its own pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people or cases of cold illness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then have the patient bind their head with any of their cloth: then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the area with hot water until you see an obvious manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then, with ease, scrape off the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then produce an incision in that area, and pull it upwards until you remove it from the skin, making sure to expose the layer of tissue beneath all around.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin: then encircle it with the tip of the spatula.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the length of its extremities when stretched and contracted, so that there is no blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if you do not cut it and do not remove it, the blood will not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then drain out three-quarters of the blood until you reach one-sixth.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then you must bind it in two places with a strong double thread made of silk or horsehair, so that it does not expand before the wounds heal and there is no blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess which lies between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that either immediately or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if it bleeds, cauterize it with a cauterizing instrument until the ends of it are burned, using a surgical knife; until its extremities are affected and the site of the operation is stabilized.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it's better to proceed with the surgery if the patient has a fever or is of hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since the cauterization helps to end moisture issues.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better for treatment purposes.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the removal of arteries, that the place be filled with old plaster: and round about it let there be placed balls made in a central manner.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the extraction, it is cured with dry medicines which cause the growth of flesh, and with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during your operation a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then quickly proceed to cut it off with a cautery or use zinc: and hold your hand until the blood is severed.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of those [items] is present for you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And immerse the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and tie it up according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And the method that is easier and less burdensome for extracting an artery involves using a cautery with two knives: make sure the sharpness of both knives matches that of amalgam.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they have an acuteness that is much less than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as two knives, the cold from each spreads out and does not cut through flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Since there is a certain amount of thickness in them, the heat of the fire is contained within and flesh is cut through quickly: thus this method is better for every operation, easier, and more straightforward.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be the space between the two knives that is equal to the thickness of a finger. After you mark two spots with the hot iron, put down both burning ones until they reach the artery in both places. This will ensure what's between the ends stretches out.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For this type of cauterization does not result in complete healing.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Section on the care and frequent changing of lacrimal (tear) duct dressings from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Head/Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are frequent tears and a passage of these from the nasal ducts which are on top of the head outside, you won't find any need for medical treatment among medicines; you will notice that the patient's face has turned red already, and they feel a walking sensation in their forehead, just like ants moving. Their eyes are strained, wet, to the point where their hair roots have already been corroded by the tears. Their eyelids were heated due to the sharpness of the tears. Then, the ancients would use this method for treating them, and they named it 'Curing with Ense.'
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if you were to shave off the hairs on his forehead for the sick person.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three cuts in the forehead that are equidistant and parallel to the length of the forehead. Each cut should be about two fingers long, and one cut will be equidistant from the nose at the center of the forehead; the second cut will be according to the length near the motion of tears, and the third one will come from the other side. Be careful not to touch the arteries that are on both sides during this procedure: extend your hand along the continuation of the two jaws, making sure there's a space equivalent to the sum of three fingers between each incision. Prepare a piece of sponge or many dried cloths; use them to soak up blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the tips of two lancets, and here follows the form for this procedure.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision at the temporal part up to the second incision: and remove all the skin between the two incisions, including the sifac which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then perform that as well from the median incision up until the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and reinsert another tool, which is named the surgical knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side against the attached flesh with the skin, and its flat side gently against the mouth: and push it until it reaches the median seam. And cut off everything hanging down from the head to the eyes: beyond that, continue the incision until what appears from the skin is reached.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this from the median seam up to another seam.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after the flow of blood has equalized, squeeze out places from the clotted blood residues.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place the cooked wax throughout each seam and put wools soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar over them.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no pus occurs hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, dissolve the bandage and administer much infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the balsam ointment, and other remedies used for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ On the care of acute tears and catarrhs in the eyes originating from within the head.
Caput V.	Title V: The Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When such events occur to someone with acute catarrh, be vigilant, and observe how their eyes have become exhausted, pale, and already weakened in appearance: and the eyelids are inflamed, and hairs fall from them, and there is an intense headache deep within the head that hurts and causes sneezing. Then recognize these symptoms as indicating that unless originating from multiple veins, such material and catarrh cannot come about otherwise.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And a better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is for you to instruct the sick person to shave their head.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Next, cut an incision in the head of the patient right in the middle of the forehead, or a bit to each side depending on the width. Start cutting with the incision from the left time (indicating mastication) to the right time. Cut until you reach the mouth. Extend your hand away from the moving temporal joints during chewing. Continue cutting until the mouth is exposed and then dry off all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with surgical forceps or with sterilized tweezers from linen fabric.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten with ointment above: and soak the ointments in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you release that and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing, then it will be necessary to rub the mouth until flesh begins to grow within it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of ground barley and four parts of colophony. Prepare the paste from these and apply it for the birth of flesh to occur in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ Concerning the care for what falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, similar to one, such as iron and sulfur; or it comes from plants, like chickpeas and beans; or it's some flexible substance like water, vinegar, and similar substances; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	So when a stone or something similar falls into the ear, which does not add to nor increase in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if you see the stone then distill some oil of violets or coriander seed into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction, and make him sneeze while you're administering it, and stuff his nostrils at the onset of the sneezing, after which you place pieces of cloth or wool around the inside of his ear, and then stretch his ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Indeed, much relief comes with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not relieve the condition, then administer the extraction with Gestis, that is, with fine Pizigaris: its shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if it relieves the condition with Gestis, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with an open-toothed hook that has few doublings.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	But if it does not relieve the condition through this method, then make a tube from air and insert the tip of the tube deeply into the ear opening. Stuff with whatever is inside the circumference of the tube mixed with softened wax oil so that only the tube is exposed to the wind. Then extract it with your strong suction force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, much relief comes from doing as we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if this method does not provide relief: then take a piece from the metal cover of the helm or from vinegar, that is, from prepared gluten used to catch birds, a small amount. Place it at the tip of the radius after you have placed the skin centered above it in a circular shape: then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if none of these methods provide relief, then prepare to divide it [the affected area], before a hot boil or twitching occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the size of the incision is such that it should reach the thin vein first within the head, and then remove it from the blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then have the sick person sit between your hands, and turn their ear towards the top, and make a small incision at the base of their ear where there is depression for themselves: and let the cut be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone. Then remove it along with what is possible from your tools.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then heal that cut as quickly as possible and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falling into the ear comes from grains that grow and swell, then administer the removal of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to you for removal, then take a thin spatula, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer that with it by removing the same species from grains that fall into the ear, and do not do this, when you think, that that grain has already been moistened by the steam of the ear until you place it in large quantities: then remove them with tongs, or with a delicate gesture, or with suction as we said, for the removal of it is facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water that enters the ear, the sick person should use a sneezing action with condensation first: and now has filled his/her own ear with a little cooked older substance: and he/she is lying on that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that (method), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and tender, and warm them with fire slightly, and have the sick person insert one from these into his/her ear opening. And wash one part of his/her foot over this section, and strike it with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So do not cease to perform this action with stones and stones until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out to such an extent that you take one from a papyrus or one from a reed and introduce its end into the ear: and you ignite the other end with fire until much of it has burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed and do this many times until all the water comes out; then remove it along with the cannula according to what was previously instructed on the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	However, when extracting an animal entering into it, if it is a small body such as a louse and similar to it, take care of it in the same way that I instructed for division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks: and what belongs to it is easier than all others which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, when extracting worms generated in the ear, if you take care of it with what we said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care is not sufficient: then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something is visible there from the worms, then extract that with gestures, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing is visible there from anything, then take a cannula of this shape, it is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top: and introduce its fine end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick person can tolerate. Then suck with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms have come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not respond to you for an exit, then fill around the cannula with paste as I instructed on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If it does not come out with what we said, then administer the distillations that the ancients were already familiar with for infecting worms; and you will find this in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let there be your pouring out which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this tool, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Just as you see it made from silver or copper, downwards tightly closed, within which there is an opening for small things, wider upwards.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So it should be that the one that pushes in the curvature of the cannula, is made from copper centrally.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish to take the reed and wrap it with a thread in proportion: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula; and let it be inside the ear: then insert the reed with the thread above, and by your hand compress it until the oil can fill the cavity of hearing and the patient feels it internally. And that which is poured into the ear should already have been gently warmed by fire: and beware not to use what has been distilled too cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	¶ On the care of wound (injury) in the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs without being punctured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some individuals where the healing process takes place inside the ear from an injury, or flesh is born there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this healing can occur deep within the ear's opening, which cannot be reached by force. Sometimes it happens close to the outer part of the opening and reaches that opening due to force.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	So, what happens deep within the ear and cannot be seen, is often difficult to treat due to its various positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for the one where force reaches it, you need to place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. Then, if you see apparent healing, open it with a thin spatula tool whose shape is as follows; its end has some tiny width, part of which is sharp: and the rest of the spatula should be soft from both sides so it doesn't damage the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If, therefore, excision originates from flesh within the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with a forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the excision is deep within the ear: then take a fine, soft rod and heat it slightly with fire. Then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel the excision with that which is found by the sick person with gravity of hearing loss, try to open it with ease: and beware, do not injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a piece of grease according to the size of the opening you made in the Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are at ease about the healing of the wounds.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take grease and pour it into rose water, then grind over it powdered sesamum seed, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear has become inflamed: then you must remove the grease, and allow it with another grease which you will apply in a cloth made with rose oil until the pustule settles warm: then care for it until it is completely healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however there is a flow of blood: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place the ear on it; and use the remaining remedies for stopping blood flow as described in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Section: On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Title VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelil (presumably referring to eyelids or something related) that occur in the eyes sometimes become wet, and then become dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or with a hook and cut them off their roots with forceps.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place over the affected areas a mixture that has been ground.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood should flow from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize after making the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Indeed, many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Section on the Care of Eyeball Torsions in the Eye.

Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something occurs in the eyelids that resembles a Granadilla in terms of its strength and hardness due to this it is called a Grandine: and it is an aggregation of large moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation is to examine this, when you see if a Grandine is progressing within it, which appears from the eyelid and moves to every part, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	So find a cut over it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape her off from all sides with ease until she is healed.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang her up with a hook, and cut her down.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, you do not prepare to cut it for him unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a small incision, then that weak thing will harm in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the cut is large: then bind it with stitches: and care for that until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it's small, no harm will come from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment restores itself and makes flesh whole.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the growth is directed from the outside to the inner parts of the ear towards the intrinsic surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the mass with a hook. Apart from that, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is extended through an incision, this does not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with a warm saline solution, and care for the wound with what promotes healing until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Section on the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a grease that forms in the upper eyelid's tunics: and it happens quite often to children. And this greases their eyes, and they get morning conjunctivitis, and they cannot see the sun's rays, because tears flow towards them, and due to this they always lie on their faces, and sleep with them, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which has already been inflated: and the Axirnath appears prominent in the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you can feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is, that the patient should place his head on your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take flaxen cloth and prepare in it pennyroyal, and make from that a pennyroyal ring the size of which contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over her and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the ring.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a thin blade, cuts occur across its width, and it is not a cut larger than that which occurs in deep bloodletting.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	It may be necessary to find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the cut according to the shape of a stub of white grease in various arrangements.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore remove it with the cloth you have soaked between your fingers towards the outside. And move your hand to the right and left until it is spread out. Be careful not to add anything to the cut so that you do not scrape into the eye with the blade, causing harm to it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the cut, you should gently add a little to the cut until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then remove it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, then bind it with powders.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among people there are those who sprinkle salt, and they place it in the depression of the cut, so that what remains from that moisture becomes liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if pus appears at the site of a warm wound, then care for it with soothing plaster until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	§ On the methods of dealing with an inflamed eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft around the eye, causing it to wrinkle like it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow on the eyelids beyond their normal growth period and become old: then they harm the eye and cause various ailments to occur, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and moisture, until this becomes the reason for the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Al-Tausir certainly treats eye injuries in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by using a cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as explained in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Al-Tausir heals through incisions and stitches.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with canals, as I am about to say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary for you to place the patient's head on your breast.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not, insert the point in it, where is the thread from the lower part of the eyelid. Let that penetrate with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid from which hairs are born. And pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back together with the eye.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	And then find within the part of the eyelid under the added hairs, going up to the larger lacrimal gland until it reaches the smaller lacrimal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	And then remove the thread. Place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then mark on top of the eyelid with an iron, to resemble the shape of a leaf of laurel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be that the figure is according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this already varies among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need to fall from the eyelid in quantity much, according to the quantity that softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	And then find with the needle above the two lines you marked, and start from the larger lacrimal gland until reaching the smaller one, and make a single cut near natural hairs, as it is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angular parts of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off (expose) the entire thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, with the needle and a fine thread made of wool, stitch together (sew) the two labia. After that, clean away any blood, and make it adhere to what is superfluous from the threads above the two eyebrows, if it's possible to do so using certain things for this purpose: but if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and thread for up to three days or four: after that, take care of the next step.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the wound without a suture and take care of it together with whatever remains, allowing it to dry up and tighten.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid will be raised at the incision point of the wound and its aggregation: but it is better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment for Ataxmir was taught by the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But there is concern over the sick person, and it comes from good treatment, and there is no fear within it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method for treatment in Ataxmir as well: it involves making a mark over the eyelid that resembles the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separated or combined hooks, according to this shape which follows, and then cut off what remains with parallel scissors, according to this shape, with equal cuts.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook and they do not match: then take an incision in which there is thread, and insert that into the middle of the shape. And insert another thread near the larger tear ducts, and a second thread near the smaller tear ducts. And stitch the threads together between your fingers with equal spacing.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand as high an equal elevation: and raise the skin over what is marked with the cut, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, when dealing with wounds, join together the two lips with stitches: and attend to it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If indeed an abscess should occur at your incision or your cut, then dress that abscess with a poultice and other remedies like it, which soothe from ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes an eyelid occurs in such a way that the hairs of it will turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we said about cutting in that case: however, stitches for both are more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ On the care of Ataxmir with needles.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND It is, to turn the eyelid and divide the cut that has been made, as I have told you.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then use your skill to make two needles or two slender sticks; their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of spathula: and you have already made an incision at both ends in each part where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join the two (needles or sticks) with their thinness over what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie each needle tightly from both ends, letting them go after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin will be tightened and deteriorate until it falls off on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then the process is slow, cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has hardened, raise the eyelid: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canulas, which you make according to this figure and measurement for their length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding the extraction of sharp pins in the eye with an awl.
Caput XII.	Title: The Head: Chapter 12
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation involves taking a fine needle and inserting a thin thread of silk into the area, gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then, join its ends together, and tie each of the knots with a very fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make another fine thread to be composed under it in brief length, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then, the patient should place his head on your chest and position it near the sun to show the operation clearly: for this is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Next, insert the needle through the Alinxotati thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid gently until you remove it above the natural pin.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the pin up to above Alinxotati: and insert it into Alinxotati's pin: if there is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the pin emerges from the eyelid with Alinxotati's pin.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however Alinxotati is pulled and the pin does not emerge with it: pull Alinxotati downwards, along with the thread you had composed in it, until Alinxotati exits through the upper opening, and you observe it by eye: then you pull Alinxotati and the thread: and remove both of them, and close the eye: and leave the eye closed for two days or three, until the pin adheres to its place, and grows above it on the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from natural hairs, and remove it together: or let it go until it extends through the space, and then remove it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Regarding the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Title XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye with Alxatrati, it is named Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati can be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, an accidental Alxatrati results from the consolidation of wounds, or sections, or cauterizations, and similar procedures.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of performing this is to identify that consolidation, and to separate its edges. Place a piece of linen between those edges, then tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it should not be that you use things which dry and constrict for its treatment; because if you do this, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was before. Rather, use things which soften for it, like Greek fennel: soak it in water in which mallow has been boiled, linen seeds, and oil; mix with a soft ointment from some of the oils, then wrap it around the linen and care for it accordingly.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasury of care is to use all your skills and ingenuity so that it does not harden into its initial shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And indeed, the operation that we have described is merely a correction of Alxatrati so that it does not return to its former shape at the place where it had completely been.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the care of Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, it is either a wrinkle or a contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Title XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is what Alxatrati does below, which is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental arises from a bone, or a tear, or searing, and things similar to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the operation for this is as follows: take a needle where there is double thread, and pass it through the flesh, so that it penetrates from the left tear to the right tear, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the hair and place it in the tear, and rotate the eyelid with it. And make two tears in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of both tears come from each of the corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle; until then they will form this shape, and that is the Greek letter 'lauda'.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount which is the length of its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Next, join the separated parts together and attach them with a thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them as we said before regarding softening medicines and stimulants until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alxatrati should happen due to a tear or suture, or searing, then it must be that you find the tear flat under the eyelashes hairline, even if it has proceeded before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with a knife, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of our discussion about caring for Alxatrati, when it is above or below, means that he should care for her in that operation according to how she is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, she is the multitude of diversities in form: and the prudent artisan prepares his mind with whatever method is possible for him until he returns to the figure towards its natural form or close to it, and the very patient does so according to what suits her from operation and tools in many positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	This consolidation occurs in many people so that the upper eyelid becomes fixed with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a hook. Then strike the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be in accordance with the sharpness of the incision of the spatulas but is blunt slightly. This way, the patient will not be disturbed during surgery, remove the spatula, and damage his eye with its sharpness; and your cut should be like you scrape off that adhesion as easily until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and heals entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye salty water and wash it out: or distil over him from a sieve made, from zinc dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with a linen thread: and place upon the eye wool saturated with the white of the eye. And after three days use the sieve, and with solid ones until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of a nail and prominence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is neural: and it is similar to a hair being hard, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not neural, similar to the whiteness of ice that has been thawed: which when touched by iron, or if you try to take it with a hook, it can be cut off, and no hook will stick in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin unless from the larger tear ducts, until they extend gradually, until they reach their full extent, and obstruct vision, and hinder the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for its incision is: when the patient puts his head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Next, gather the nail with a hook of minimal double thickness and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Next, take the point and insert it into a hair from horses', cows, or rabbits. And let there be strong thread, and double the end of the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the tip and tie it to the nail with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape off the side of the nail that follows the pupil as if you were holding it together with hair until behind its hindquarters.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder in the root of the tear duct with a sharp instrument, or with blunt forks: and remove the natural flesh of the tears, so as not to happen that there is a continuous flow of tears from his incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be scraped with a soft spatula, which has this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, do not let the spatula touch the skin of the nail, and cause a break in it, and perforate the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour some ground salt or a sifted substance from zinc into the eye, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then attend to it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerveous and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a hook be implanted within it, then this type of nail requires frequent treatment with medicines. It will heal as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to penetrate it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a soft spatula that is subtle, gentle, and has weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with reason and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	And when you see that it itself is being thinned and crushed, and the reason prints into it, then distill from your own hour into the eye from a sifted substance from zinc, or from red sand, or ground salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it until everything of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there appears to be an opposing hot pus blister within the eye: then remove it yourself, and attend to the blister until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with subtlety until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the eyelid's flesh, if it causes significant harm when damaging the eye, should be suspended with a hook and the affected part should be cut from it. And not make the final cut, so as not to allow the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Next, soak a red wad or one made from zinc until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ Concerning the operation on Alguardenic and flesh that grows inside the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Flesh of a reddish color sometimes is born in the eyes of some people, either mixed or placed on top of the pupil until it covers it, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids inward: and it is likened to the balsamic rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is an operation for this as well; so that even the sick may place his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and gather that entire flesh with suitable hooks for this purpose: and hold that with one pair of forceps, or bear it in your hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh up to the first part until you finish the entire thing with a serrated blade.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to harm the eye during the operation: and let your cut coincide with where you are cutting it or using a spatula as we described in the incision of claws, or with large forceps that are used to gather anser (a type of bird), according to what its form will be after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	Once your cut is complete and all the Alguardenic flesh has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt. Or distill a red powder into it, and similar treatments from corrosive medicines: and place a clove of garlic covered in almond oil on top of the eye. To keep it safe from heat.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there is any remainder of the cautery and if your blood becomes warm, and you feel a warm pus: then remove the eye, and take care of it along with that which stops the pus.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then continue to treat it together with the procedure until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly for the flesh that is added which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that all weakness of the eyes arising from natural causes or accidental ones be treated with iron during operations: and you must not touch your hand into any of these operations until you discover what part of the body is able to endure this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ On removing Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Title XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are the red veins that weave over the eye and prevent its own operation. They weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first consider whether the eye where there is Sebel is strong and does not have any other illness besides Sebel: then collect its Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it will happen that when you instruct the weak, he should place his head on your chest.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your wisdom: and let the hook be finely doubled, as this shape is shown, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, as this shape is shown.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine forceps and with fineness, and remove the blood hour by hour until you feel those veins move out of the eye, and dissolve them. And beware not to hurt the eye with the edges of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be during midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: so that you do not cut unless those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed, then distill into the eye a green or red mixture, so that its sharpness may nourish what has remained from it.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	And if however, it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then plaster the eye with what soothes the eye pain. And let a few days pass until its pain subsides. And secure it from hot drafts. Then apply it again according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ Reduction of Arista to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Doctors call the fistula 'Arista', which they treat with a cauterizing agent or an acute medication that burns according to what was previously described.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in that manner: unless you burn above the pustule at its birth, and extract all the moisture within it and pus until the mouth appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	And when the mouth is revealed, and you see corruption or darkness within it, then shave it off with an instrument that has this form.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And they are called 'Asperis of the head'.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from iron that is red-hot, and let its head be round like an azir, which should have a point made by the tip of a file or a fine puncture from a small chisel. And place it upon the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand until you know that the corruption is already shaved. And do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal and cauterizing bandages.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the area is stabilized, and flesh begins to grow there, and the course of healing is removed: then it remains forty days, without renewing itself, nor getting worse, nor any event happening there. Then you will know that it has been healed already.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent there except to reduce the sinus back to the nasal opening according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And proceed as follows when you remove the bone secondly with iron or with sharp medicine: and once the opening of the bone is detected, then take the drill according to this form. The end should be made of iron, triangular. And let the wood of it taper until the tip like what you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be near to the tear duct: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it. Through this, when he finds wind escaping from him as he holds his hand over his own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the area with medicinal and cauterizing bandages, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	And when flesh begins to grow and the area hardens, then the material that was flowing externally returns to the nose. Therefore, it becomes lighter for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On reducing the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye is prominent in its entirety and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then you must release the patient. Afterwards, let him bleed (perform phlebotomy). Later place suction flasks on his neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a lotion made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and myrrh.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then, over the ointment with many powders, tie the eye from above.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the amount of powders is: take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth from them over four: make many from them. Then place them one on top of another, according to the quantity that the eye needs: then tie them with a firm bandage of hard cloth above them.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And use iterative suction devices without cutting.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the suction instruments, and let the eye heal tightly day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the bandage has again softened, then it must be tightened much: afterwards remove the bandage day and night as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see that the eye has returned to its normal condition, it is good; and if not, then repeatedly apply the ointment, powders, bandage, and suction devices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ On cutting of the tunica vula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the tunica vula, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of sand from the eye, causing an irregular shape due to this and for the invasion by pathogens: then there is surgery on it, as I describe, and it is necessary to insert the tip of the instrument into the root of the granulation tissue starting from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another tip with a double thread at the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate. And remove the first tip according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut through both threads at the site, and bind with it a part of the granulation tissue around an awl: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract it and place infused wool over the eye like a patch of albuginea. And let him go until the thread with the bone falls out.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which strengthens itself, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the bone is tied from all sides with a circular piece of cloth until the eye attains great elevation.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then a thin spatula is used to puncture through until it reaches the depth of the eye, and the wetness of albuginea flows out. The eye descends immediately after and enters in again. Then tighten it until healing occurs.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ On the care for Alcmena.
Caput XXII.	Head 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness known as Alcmena is not simply a thin film that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation in this case is to have the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you feel the film come down to the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is shaped and does not descend, and the eye's view is released: and the sick person will see as they saw before. And if it doesn't descend below, you'll know there's water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however it is not prepared for the descent of the film as we said, then have the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take the thin spatula and apply it above the corneal membrane at the part where it continues with the corneal tissue near the rim, until the film can come out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore he emerges, then distill into the eye hot water which you have mixed with honey: or water in which you already boiled the Greek fennel and honey: afterwards it is treated with all other treatments, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Chapter on the care of the water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Title XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the form of water in division and what is suitable for puncturing, explaining and demonstrating it with words. Then receive this same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	So then it must happen that you make the sick person sit between your hands as a square, opposite to the light and close to the sun. And tie the healthy eye of him, and tightly bind it, afterwards if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, use your right hand; or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then receive with your right hand if the eye is on the left side: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the agatha near the crown along the width of the radius at the apparent white area of the smaller lacrimal gland. Then push the agatha with force and move your hand with it until the agatha penetrates into the eye's fog. And you feel that the agatha has already reached the dry part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it must be the measure of the agatha's journey to the depth, the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the black area: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	Indeed, you will see those things within the pupil with the vision of your eye, because of the clarity of the corneal coat.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the agatha until it reaches the spot where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards alternately one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that which he opens his sight upon immediately, and the mercury in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the water therefore descends, then remove it after a second, except where mercury emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is removed, and does not ascend: then extract the mercury with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear beryl salt in water: and wash the eye with it afterward.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the entire lump of fat or wool浸过的rose oil around the eye, and garlic inside: then bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	And we, as well as those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	And if the mercury does not obey you to enter into the eye because of its hardness, for it is from humans whose eye is extremely hard: then you must take a tool called Alberid's spatula, which has this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Pierce it therefore with the spatula only at the joint, and do not fully insert your hand into the hole: and there should only be a way to make an opening for the mercury place subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the mercury as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And upon completing your task, prepare for the patient a well-centered resting place where he can sleep on his back in a dark room. And prevent him from all movements and coughing. Serve him food as nature finds soothing to him. And let him not move his head with either right or left hand at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the band be according to its own position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then release this within that dark house, and test its effectiveness: and show him the result.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then shorten the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done at the time of treatment or immediately after the cut: rather, you need to let him do this thing elsewhere. This is because water rises quickly due to a strong wind.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however, a warm pus occurs: then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct this along with what soothes the pus, until it is soothed. Then fully test its use, and place over his face an opening through which its use can be regulated for several days, while he exists in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then gradually leave the house and converse with him according to his own cases or circumstances.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you will know that the student should not be excluded from seeing occasionally in a room with light: then he dares to attend upon surgery.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of those who were from Alayrach have reached us, who said that something was done in Alayrach where a magnadn (possibly referring to an instrument or incision) was made, through which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed no one has been seen among you here who did this; nor have I read of it in any ancient books. And it's possible that this is something new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes and species of incisions using the magnadn (possibly referring to an instrument or incision), so that they stand over those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Make them of proper air material: and let their ends be similarly the same in thickness as these, and have an acute end.
Formae magda.	The form of Magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes, various kinds of flesh are born in the nose, from which something resembles many-footed scorpions; and from this there is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of a yellowish color. And from this, there is what is soft flesh, not of a yellowish color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, for that which from these flesh parts is soft and not deceitful or cancerous, you should make it sit in your hands facing upwards like the sun, open its nostrils, and insert an implement into those flesh parts. Then guide them outwards, and cut off whatever you have identified from them with a sharp and thin instrument until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if there is something left from that which cannot be removed by cutting off, then shave it with one of the finer instruments until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	And if blood is dominant or if a hot boil occurs, then apply to it whatever is necessary: or it is from malignant boils, in which case proceed by cauterizing it until the blood is severed and all flesh has been removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after making an incision into the nose, expel vinegar, water, or wine to it afterwards.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	And if the nose opens and moisture proceeds from there until it reaches the palate, then you will know that he/she is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	And if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is born flesh within him/her in the upper parts of the nasal bones, to which the tool does not reach with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	So then it is necessary to use thread with some thickness and many knots in it. And place between every knot an amount of one finger or less. The patient should insert the end of the string into his nose with the bone, or as possible after performing something similar on himself: and pull their smell until it reaches up to the nostril and comes out over the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, many times children like this Atom do it in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the string, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nostril.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then prepare the incision of the flesh with knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh and threads of the string are together.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread and after clearing the blood, place the camphor you soaked in the Egyptian ointment into the nostril. Do this for three days or longer until the ointment coats the entire remaining flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead pipe at the end of the operation in the nostril for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however there is need for treatment that dries, use this one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the treatment of purging of the head, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver or copper; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell, and its opening in the same manner.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make the pipe closed, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for purging the head should be full and open: let there be a handle at its end, with which you will hold it, when you heat it with oil or whatever you wish from juices and other flowing substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of repairing Thelul's nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Thelul often gives birth at the end of his nose, and it grows and increases with days until it forms an appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, one should do away with that at the beginning of its appearance and remove it all.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the site, or a cautery, or a burning medicine which is placed in its spot.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the cutting of it therefore delays until it grows, then consider if it is stony, hard, with a yellowish color and few sensations: then do not touch it with iron because pus forms due to cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Indeed, I have seen many times when one cuts the lump and then a great disease happens to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the lump has a soft touch, and it is not yellow in color, and you see that an entire cut is possible within it, then treat the sick person, and cut it out without fear and without panic: and care for the site with what dries and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when dislocation occurs in one of these cartilages, there is little need for the operation, unless it happens to certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that (referring to dislocation or displacement), you should consider if there is a recent wound with its blood: and then bind the wounds together with stitches. Afterwards, care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the continuity of the solution have already been separated and each part is healthy, then it becomes necessary to remove all tissue visible from its skin until bleeding occurs.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then attach the two lips with stitches and tighten them. And apply over it dragon's blood powder and ground frankincense. Place above this pieces of a plaster mixture of diafinicon and another from consolidating plasters. And release the tied for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then free him, and change the medicine: and release him until the threads come off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method for stitching is as follows: attach the continuity of the wound, or with pins, as we have described in the case of abdominal stitches; or stitch the wound with thread, as you should know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the removal of nodules from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	To many people, it often happens that hard nodules similar to seeds of plants are found within their lips: some of them are smaller and others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you should open the lip and cut over every nodule on it, and hang it up with a hook, then pierce it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the area after the cut with ground substances until blood begins to flow.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and care for the area with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ On making an incision in the tissue born on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times a flesh growth appears above the gum, which the ancients call an abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you must suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it near its root, allowing the pus to drain or blood to flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the site something ground, such as powders or other embolizing agents, dry ones.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns after treatment (for it often does), then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	¶ Concerning the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes aggregations occur on the surfaces of teeth from within and extending to the outer part, and between the gums there are scaly, unpleasant layers, which sometimes decay and turn yellow or green until corruption reaches the gum and diseased teeth result from this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you must have the sick person sit between your hands and place their head in your bosom, then grind away the tooth and its dentin where you see scales and resemble sand: until nothing remains from them, similarly do this for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and others until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is at the beginning of reason is taken away from them, it is good: and if not, then apply the reason repeatedly over them on another day, secondly, and thirdly, until the final study reaches to what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you will know that a tooth requires razors of various shapes and forms, with many figures: according to how they are prepared for your operation: because the razor used to remove teeth from the lower part is different from the one used to remove teeth between them, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And may those forms of razors be prepared for you that you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ On the Extraction of Toothache.
Caput XXX.	Title XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you attend to the tooth with all your skill and resources when it is in pain, and do not delay in its removal.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it's being removed: because it is a noble substance; until then, when there is no excuse for removing it, then the patient should be compelled to remove it themselves, so that it becomes firm and certain with you, that the tooth causing pain remains with you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Indeed, the patient is often deceived by pain and thinks there's something wrong with the tooth and removes it themselves: afterwards, the pain persists until the unhealthy tooth has been removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	And when the tooth causing pain is certified to you himself, then it must be that you incise around the tooth with a small spatula, where there's something beneficial, until the gum softens from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps on that part of the tooth and hold it in a good position, between your knees: you should hold it so firmly that it doesn't move. Then pull the tooth straight according to its direction, making sure not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, trying to move it as you did initially.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with the tip of a thin rod so as not to break it when you are tightening your forceps on top of it.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you precisely perform scarification around the gum from every part much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so as not to break it yourself, and let a part of it remain, and return over the weak from that malice which is greater pain for him at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do that which the ignorant phlebotomists perform in their process, and overstep their courage towards removing it, beyond which they administer what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Indeed, many times they cause great illnesses to come about in men, of which the roots are harder to break and thus remain all or some of them. Or they extract it along with certain bones from the jawbone; as we have seen this happen on many occasions.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then after its removal, it is rinsed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there happens a blood flow from the places (this often occurs), then rub something with zinc and fill the place with it. If this does not happen, burn it if you do not have access to zinc.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps of fine shape that move the tooth initially, should have long ends, short handles, be thick, so they do not bend when pressed upon a tooth: they should resemble the thick handles until you tighten them, neither biting themselves nor bending. The ends should be short and made from iron or centered cast, having straight ends. And in their ends there should be teeth, some entering into others and being tight according to the necessary constriction, firmly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they make ends like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they have a strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jaws' bones.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains something at the site of tooth extraction which has broken off, then it is necessary to place a butter ball over the area for one or two days until the site softens. Then introduce to it with an applicator, or forceps; whose ends resemble the mouth of a bird that is named stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this tool is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends are made like a file or like an Aliskilfgi, which is another tool in medieval surgery.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not respond to you when using these forceps, then you must cut over the root and remove all flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let its end be short, slightly thickened: and do not let it absorb water in order that it may not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root escapes through this, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other tools whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular end has some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular end is thin.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Assistance can also be given with this tool that has two branches, which has this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that precede it according to the number of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Assistance should also be given with this tool that resembles a large hook, which has this form - triangular ends twisted together, and containing some thickness to prevent it from breaking. It must not be soaked in water either.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you will know that the tools for teeth are many: and other tools are not counted, and the skilled artisan, being subtle in his art, finds his own tool by himself according to what indicates him the operation and the discomforts themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are fields for which they did not say the tool of the ancients due to their diversity in species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	And if the mouth breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth or it decays: then examine him in his place with what is suitable to him among the tools and forceps I mentioned in extraction of roots, and assist with gestures whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be a gradual thickening in it so that the mouth is constrained or held with him and does not escape or decay until the mouth comes out. And restore the place with medicines suitable for this purpose.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if there is a small decay in the bone, then shave it from its own decay and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the prominent closure of teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	Title XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not grow according to their natural course, this unpleasant condition arises due to that form, particularly when it happens in women and girls, specifically during their menstrual periods.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you must take into consideration.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	So if a tooth is born after another tooth and it does not fit, or there is the possibility of its being too long without grinding or shaping: then extract that tooth. If it is attached to another tooth, then use this tool with this form when you strike it in.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a slender point made of iron that has very sharp tips.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be on a day when you hit it for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other comes out from the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If there is an elevated part exposed by his own burr: then the burr itself together with the burr from India, whose form is like this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely from India, and the handle of its small points like that of a needle-making burr: with which the tooth is ground down gradually over many days with ease, so as not to disturb the tooth and for it to fall out. Then make it softer, finish it by grinding it with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that breaks off when part of it is taken and hurts the tongue: then you must also use a burr on it until all roughness from that break has been removed and leveled. It should be flattened so as not to hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Paragraph 1: Treatment of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is shaking and disturbance in the front teeth due to impact or by chance, and it cannot be weakened enough to bite on what he eats so that they don't fall out: and when treatment with styptic medicines fails, then it's necessary for artistry to intervene and bind them with gold wire. For silver turns green and decays after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of moderate thickness both in fineness and coarseness according to the quantity that fits between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	Indeed, the form of treatment is such that you take the wire and insert a double length between two healthy teeth. Then weave with both ends of the thread through the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the weaving to the tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then continue the incision up to the point where you started: and apply your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not moved at all. And let the tightening that you do when tying the thread be noticeable on the roots of teeth, so as not to allow (excess).
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with pincers; and gather both, then turn them over. And hide them between a healthy tooth and a moved tooth to avoid injuring the tongue; afterwards remove it such that it is tight until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however they are severed or cut, tie them with another thread and it will be stable in such a way for the entire duration.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of holding two healthy teeth and two moving teeth together as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the case of eruption and are held just as we described, remaining there. And it does this only if a skilled artisan is doing so.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes it happens that a certain part of the bone is adapted from the incisors: and it becomes like the form of a tooth, it is placed in its place, where the tooth is protected and tightened as we said, and remains, and serves with him for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Section: On the excision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and impedes speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this particular ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, present since birth with every human being, or accidental, from an injury that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation for this is as follows: open the mouth of the sick person at the top in your hollow, and raise their tongue. Then cut that nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is no longer held back by it.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hardness and swelling in it, and that arises from the healing of wounds, then insert a hook into this, and make an opening through its width until you reach the ligament, and dissolve the swelling.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, so that there is not a deep wound in the flesh, and you cut into an artery there, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then, wash around the site of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen bandage which the patient must wear every night: so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there occurs a flow of blood, then place over the site ashes to be sprinkled.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the blood binds you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous (slow-working) cautery, which is suitable for this: afterwards care for it together with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Section on the removal of the Ranula, which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Title: Thirty-Fifth Chapter
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an ulcer occurs under the tongue that resembles a toad's, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it expands so much as to fill the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation for this is, that you open the mouth of the patient under the sun and examine the ulcer.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a yellowish color or black, hard, which the patient does not feel, then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it descends to a whiter area where there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut through it with fine scissors, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If your blood overcomes you during your time of surgery, then place on it the zegi grain until the blood is removed. Then proceed to your surgery again until you remove it with its full complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then mix it with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of the treatment until that stage, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the treatment of extracting two pairs of tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and windpipe, that is glands which resemble cotton wool, which are found behind the tonsils: and they are named as two tonsils. When you treat them with what we have instructed in division and if they do not heal, then take note of this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the abscess is hard, yellow in color and has few symptoms: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color, and the base of it is large: then do not touch it even with iron fearing the flow of blood, rather remove it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it: or it will burst on itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and the base of it is thin: then you must puncture it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is within it, which you should consider before your own surgery. If its abscess was warm and fully formed, or diminished somewhat, then therefore have him sit exposed to sunlight, and his head on your chest: open his mouth and let him accept it serving between his hands, and press his tongue below with this tool, whose form is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Make it from silver, or air, which should be thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press on it with your tongue and a pus bubble becomes visible to you, and falls upon it: then take the curved instrument, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out as much as possible towards the external part, leaving a bit of them attached to the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut into it with the tool, which has this shape that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated with forfics (awl-like tools): however, the ends of these must be rounded so that each hole at the end of them is sharp and directly points to another. Therefore, take care that it be made from tempered iron or oiled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this tool is not present, then cut it with the spatula, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, but not on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut the first tonsil, cut the second one according to the same manner of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the operation, gargle the patient with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If bleeding occurs during this, gargle with water that has boiled for garlic peels or leaves of myrtle and similar herbs until the bleeding stops. Then take care of them until healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes pus blisters appear elsewhere in the throat, other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut those (pus blisters) according to what I said regarding the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed, I have already treated a woman with pus in her throat that was born between her throat and would darken into blackness, it had almost closed off the entire throat; and the woman could hardly breathe when she used to take deep breaths, she also had been restricted from drinking water and eating for quite some time now. If she had survived for one more day, or even two days, it was likely that she would perish.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen only as far so that it sent out two branches until they reached beyond two nasal holes.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hastened properly and attached one of them to a hook of one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large segment came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it off where to grasp it by the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which was done to it as it proceeded from the nasal opening on another side.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; afterwards, I attached a hook to the abscess. Next, I cut off a part of it, and it did not bleed much except for a little blood. Therefore, the throat of the woman was cleared, and she immediately began drinking water, then she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not stop piercing that abscess many times for a long period of time. The abscess would form in the place where I pierced it until it stretched excessively and reached that point.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised a method and cauterized the abscess between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	The result remained after the addition: then I walked away from her part and did not know what God had done to her afterwards.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	### On the operation of cutting abscesses in the foot.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the mucus descends to the foot, and it forms an abscess, and if it is long, then it is called a perpendicular. And if there is a large, round swelling in the lower part, then it is also called a uua.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is healed with what we said about division, and the healing does not stick to it: then you will see that the hot abscess has settled within it, and it is thin: at this point, it must be cut into her.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is formed from that which is round, and does not have length, and is either bloody or of a light brown color, or black, and it lacks sensation: then the appropriate action is to make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And there is fear over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the method I described from whiteness and its length, make the sick person sit near the sun: and press its tongue with a tool which will follow my description. Then fix a hook in a cup, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two tools I mentioned for cutting both tonsils at once.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not cut from it, except what is added above the natural termination without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more from it, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then, after the cut, use what we described for cutting both tonsils at once: and take care of her until she is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If the sick person is frightened by the cut, then you should use skill in his cauterization without fear and panic.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in this is not without water - and it is that you should place the sick person's head on your chest.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press its tongue with the tool we described.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a flame from an unextinguished fire. Do not make the application too thick or too thin, fill the depression of this tool with it, whose form is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Place its extremity where the medicine is applied, just like the concavity of a cochlea's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine upon one part of it: and let the patient lie on his side so that the saliva from his mouth by means of the intrinsic medicine may flow out, in such a way that nothing descends from there to the throat of himself and hurts him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply that amount of the medicine for half an hour until you see it has diminished and calmed the irritation caused by the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to drink water, place your finger at the extremity of the radius, and pour the water with medicine over it. Then insert the bone with the finger into the tube from above until the bone adheres to one part.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Perform this many times, until you achieve what you desire for the cauterization of the bone.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release it; for it rises and falls after three days or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to apply the medicine again, do so: and after cauterization clean around the bone with butter-soaked gauze and cleanse it using the material that is around his body from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is treated externally with ointments, and rinsed with gargles until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This method of treatment is more beneficial than an incision and lasts longer due to the fear it produces.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it heals even with something that is finer than a cauterization and an incision: it heals through fumigation, according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a reed, hyssop, origanum, rute, sseah (possibly typo), chamomillam and similar from herbs: and gather all of them together or some of them into a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and let it boil: the pot should be stirred well inside. And there should be an opening in the middle of the pot, on which the concave instrument should be prepared according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or copper: and insert the end, on which is the apple, into the patient's mouth until the vapor ascends to some extent above the cannula, until much obscures the tube.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then iterate this many times, until healing occurs.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the onset of mumps.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Indeed, it is added in the case of mumps: and you should not do this unless at the stage when there is a decline in its warmth.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a tube, and compose its end with the peel of an onion: so that the mouth of the patient is not burned: because the peel of the onion prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Section on the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Title XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times it adheres in the throat, or in the mouth of an animal, or from a fish, or otherwise.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what appears above what falls under the use of your tongue, after pressing the tongue with the tool towards the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if what is not revealed to you and is hidden in the throat does not disappear before food is chewed in the stomach, it should make the patient vomit.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed, what has attached itself may come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the patient swallow a fragment of onion, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a slice of dry bread: or take a fragment of dried marine sponge that is soft, and tie it into a string, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the spikes, or mouth is, and is extracted, then he comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use the tool made of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius slightly, and at the end of it have curvature, which insert into its throat with ease: and let it have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it beware of contact with its epiglottis, so that no coughing happens to him and pushes the mouth or the spike out, or the physician pushes it in with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person inserts is better, because of their knowledge about the location of the matter: and pushes downward or pulls their hand with the tool upwards until it has extracted whatever was prepared for him completely.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ Concerning the extraction of the Blood Worm.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When treating a bloodworm with what I said about dividing treatment among physicians and if it does not stick together, then examine the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or after placing his tongue with the tool I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your blow falls on the bloodworm, extract it with a small hook or with slender implements turned diagonally.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a shallow cupped tube, and insert it into the sick's throat up to close to the throat: then insert the heated iron of the tube into the cupped part while holding it in fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times, and let the sick person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let her take the treated wound filled with cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him drink his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	Therefore, when the leech feels the water, it falls off.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come off with what we have told you, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs, or with wings using the tool that was described for the fumigation of an olla.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it falls by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation during fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing live prunes with fire inside: and let the pot be covered with a lid, having a hole in it; and compose the end of the tool in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then release the fumigation; and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	Therefore, the leech falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the sick person should tolerate thirst, and eat salty food, and herbs, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary for this regimen to be followed.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the tool with which the leech is removed from the throat when it falls upon her.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to tongs, as you see: because there is this curvature in it which goes into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called Ciconia, in which there is roughness like that of an iron saw: when it grips something, it does not release itself entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the incision of abscesses, their sections, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Title XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of abscesses are many, arising from various modes, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and this single type within this book: they differ in the puncturing of them, and their sections, being divided into two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One kind is within the abscess itself, and due to its exposure to moist conditions.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places where it occurs from within the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring at the head is another from an abscess occurrence at the anus: and an abscess occurring on a fatty area is another from an abscess happening at joints. And each of them has its own judgment according to their procedure.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses are those that should not be punctured unless after the healing in them and its completion. And from these are those that should be punctured while they are raw and have not matured according to their completeness.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses which are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint and extends, until the decay inside its surrounding possibly corrupts the tendons or nerves of that joint. This is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is it abscess at the main member: for if you delay the puncturing of it until its completion, it will harm either him or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	It is near the anus, puncture it then, the immature one: and there should not be a need to puncture a pus bubble that isn't fully digested, unless it is near the anus so as not to become deeply putrefied, and extends towards the inner parts of the anus, and creates a fistula, or forms at its end which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of puncturing a pus bubble, which has matured according to the complement: and this occurs when there's alleviation of pain, decrease in fever, and reduction of redness, along with diminishment of pulse, and head discomfort related to the pus bubble: and all other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the same puncture in the lower part of the pus bubble, and at a more pronounced prominence: and let the perforation extend longitudinally throughout the body, if the pus bubbles are located in hand and foot parts, cutaneous lesions, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and lastly, in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, proceed with the puncture according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when pus bubbles are in fatty areas: then it is better to release its puncture until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you puncture it before that, the course of the poison from there will be prolonged, and many sores and pus will occur, and perhaps the edges will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some pus bubbles are punctured longitudinally throughout the body due to necessity: or according to where that member needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary that you administer a small puncture in small pus bubbles, and a wide puncture in large pus bubbles: or multiple sections similar to the size of the pus bubbles.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from the abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be concave. And incision should be made when it has already become like a bandage and is done within the limit where it is already dead: as happens in many cases of pus and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from these are those which are cut by making a section with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from these is derived, like the shape of a leaf of myrtle into which an incision would be made.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As for the groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from these there are those that receive a round cut and a crescent-shaped cut, as well as others similar to them resulting from cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	As for the one that does not have a head, like the soft superficial abscesses, it must be pierced with a superficial or simply flat puncture.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it must be done when the abscess is large and has already collected a lot of pus; you should pierce it so that nothing sticks and extract all the pus at once, indeed extract some part from within it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then continue to treat the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then again, extract some more from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Perform that (extractions) many times according to the process, until it is completely gone: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man who has deteriorated. For the animal spirit is resolved from one animal to another with the ejection of pus: and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not know.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	So be cautious about this chapter, it carries great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your puncture for the abscesses, you must cleanse the wound: and consider afterwards.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the ulna is less in the patient due to apotematisation (shortening by disease), or if there's a flat section, then administer linseed, or old soap.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess and multiple perforating wounds are present, then you must introduce linseed into every wound until it reaches the opposite side.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you cut off a part of the skin in an abscess or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old soap, or as when it is woven, or by removing the wool of linen without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then release it, and attend to that which needs to be handled with the ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	And if there is a flow of blood during your time for the operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after having soaked the cloth in them: and place it over the site of blood flow multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if the flow of blood persisted, then it is necessary to administer treatment and care, as well as powders which I have described in various places of this book and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	And if it is during winter and the site of the abscess is among many nerves, then you must pour in powders mixed with wine and hot oil, and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during summer and the areas are fatty, then you must place powders that have been soaked in water and oil, or mix it with wine and oil, and present it all cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day when we said, then you must release the abscess, cleanse it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of the cure of apNguồns universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the division of my explanation, I have already spoken about all apanguosns, how the way to their cure is treated singularly in this chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	¶ On the division of apanguosns that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There are small apanguosns that occur in the skin of the head. They belong to a category called nodules which contain sacks like those found on them; they might as well be swollen chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of these.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fatty ones; among them are those that contain a moisture-like substance similar to mud; among them are those that contain a moisture-like substance similar to foam and powders; there are others like these, and among them are those that are stone-hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And concerning all sections and their removal, there is no fear during the operation because when you make a cut on them, there isn't any conflict with an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation for sectioning them is as you will experience it with the tool whose shape comes after this, which is called 'Intromissum', until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains moisture, then section it by cutting along its length in a superficial manner: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And start the sectioning from line b to line g. When moisture is drained out, then scrape off (the area) which contains that moisture, and do not remove anything entirely from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Indeed, it returns many times if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the head in Egyptian oil if there is any present; or else in water and salt. And fill it with this (substance) and allow it to heal for another day before removing it.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	Indeed it eats what remains from the wound.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply it several times over what remains from the wound with the second and third Egyptian [substance], and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the wound. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a fatty boil: then cut it according to this form, having the shape of a cross: and remove the horns between the two sections, and scrape it from every side: and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery opposes you, then do what I will instruct you to do afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the boil if there is stone, from the section and care of it being the same as what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over stone boils is easier since there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these boils that occur at the head in certain people, for which there is no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is the case: for when I cut over a boil on the head of an old woman and found a boil like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone hit it with force while pushing against it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	However, with other boils that occur on the head, apart from these specific boils that happen on children's heads and at the ear roots, the section of all of them should be a superficial cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or rather always puncture them from the lower part of them, so that the flow of healing may go downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for them with what is appropriate according to their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the sectioning of Strobilus in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Title XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many times, such hernias occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And among those which occur in the neck, there is one and many: and they are generated from each other: and every Strobilus is within its own proper membrane, just as it is in nodes and hernias of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	The forms of these Strobiluses are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them, there are stony ones: and among them are those that contain moisture: and among them are evil ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	So, for the one that you see among them with good arrangement in touch, whose color is clearly close to the skin tone, and can be moved throughout any part of it, and it isn't attached to neck nerves, nor to lymph nodes, nor to an artery, and it's not deep: you should cut her out by a superficial section from the upper part up to the lower part of the body along line b. to line g., and scrape her off from every part: and extend two skin flaps with a scalpel, or with many blades if needed, just as we have described in hernias of the head, and elsewhere, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And for caution, do not let the vein or nerve be hit.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be sharply pointed: so that you do not add your hand with the cut during surgery or unsettle the patient, and accidentally cut what is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you do cut a vein, or an artery, or if it prevents you from performing the operation, then place in the wound some ground substance, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and tighten the wound, and release him until the pain of the hernia subsides and the wound heals: or if you want it to start putrefying.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is removed by units, therefore proceed with your operation until completion.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, using your index finger, check if any of the Strophula remains with others: therefore cut them and clean those.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the Strophula: then you must not cut that Strophula from its root. Instead, it should be tied with a double strong thread and allowed to fall off without causing damage.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with the old wadding which you have already prepared in the Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophula is cut, then you must join the lips of two wounds: and immediately take care of them yourself as soon as you see that there is no excess left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you find that there is still excess due to the size of the Strophula, then you must aim to cut its root and remove it: and apply the stitch we have mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And regarding what the Strophula contains in terms of moisture, puncture it with a superficial incision so that you can see its place of maturation: and make the puncture from the point following below on the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture, apply licor with ointment and similar remedies so that it can heal what remains from the corruption, until you see the wound has already been cleansed. Then take care of it with a healing ointment for skin tissue until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ Concerning the sectioning of the epiglottis in an accident involving strangulation in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this procedure was done on the epiglottis and no one has performed it here on our land. And this is their word record of what they did.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	When there is a balance or equilibrium, it's necessary to perform the section of the epiglottis. If this doesn't provide benefit through that means, because all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a warm boil in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no discomfort in the canals, it's necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, for protection against the ruin which comes from pre-facilitation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we perform that (meaning possibly a surgical procedure), it should be done to cut the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, making a small section across its width, at the point where two circles are between them. And this is the appropriate place for the cut because it's protected from flesh and blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it should be that he extends the throat skin with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find out the skin until he reaches the canal: if he sees anything from there, properly cut the blood vessel.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the siphon as we have described: and it is indicated about the canal section from phlegm that escapes from there, with what breaks off, and the removal of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound open at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When then the time comes when there is fear of pre-facilitation, join two lips to the wound on the skin and that alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to be born, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse, which we have narrated, is not an exposition unless when they recognize that some of these aphorisms has already affected the throat of the sick: and then the patient has surpassed death in elevation, and wishes to be cut through by his breathing aspiration: they proceed to the second epiglottis, so that the sick man breathes over the wound with a certain respiration, and is saved from death: for this reason they ordered that the open wound be left open until malice of distress has been consumed, and its malice lasts three days, and it seems like itself. Then therefore they ordered to drain the wound, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I have seen by myself is this: one maid took the knife and sent it into her own throat, and it cut off a part of the bronchial canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was summoned for her treatment, and found her groaning, as if it were the groaning of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound and found that only a little blood had come out of it.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I concluded that she had not torn out the vein or artery; and that the air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I treated it accordingly, and took care of her wound until she was healed. And nothing happens to the maid except a croak in her voice, and she returns after days with better dispositions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ Concerning the section of the throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Title XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This is called the Hernia of the Gullet, it is named large pus pocket according to the body's color: and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it can occur in two ways: either naturally, or by accident.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural case, there is no artifice.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	By accident, it occurs in two ways: one of which is similar to large lumps.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to a pus pocket that forms from a lymph node.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it. It should not be assumed with iron on it unless the place is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an introduction tool.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a large lump and not suspended by any vein, then cut it like one would cut lumps. And extract it with what it contains if it's within the lump; if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with what is necessary from treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ Concerning the surgery of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Title XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodules, and I have already described all their kinds earlier. Here, however, it will be necessary to describe the difference between a Nodule and an Eruption in case there is any confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I am therefore saying that when an Eruption is characterized by fever and high body temperature, intense pain until the overflow stops and complete decay occurs, then there is no longer any fever or heat.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With respect to a Nodule, it does not have fever, nor body temperature, nor pain and contains them within the pus sacs which is its proper bag and varies according to the color of the body: and their beginning occurs like chickpeas and develops like boil and can be either larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty: or retaining moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Hence, when you come to the treatment of the Node, you must experience it and inquire about it first with the tool that is called Intromissum, according to how its form will be described in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining the answers and all nodes is, that you take this tool and introduce it into the wet place you find in the node: and gradually rotate your fingers with it until you know that the tool has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then, place the last part of your hand according to the size of the node.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the Intromissum, and observe what emerges during its withdrawal.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If moisture is emerging, regardless of its color: then dry it by a superficial cut, as I explained in the other nodes.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not emerge during the withdrawal of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty. Dry it by cutting above with a cross-shaped form, following this shape as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, scrape the skin off from all sides easily: and try to keep the pincers on top of it so that you can remove both of them along with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	And if the pincers break during surgery and it is impossible to extract the healthy part, as this happens often, then remove it immediately until nothing remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any amount, whether little or much, remains from it, the Node will return most often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it defeats you and leaves some in you: then fill the wound at your completion with some corroding and sharp powders. And press the wound, and place over it something which sits an warm敷料, and care for it together with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore it is a large Knot, then tie its two lips, and care for it with what attaches it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If it is a contrary pulsatile vein to you, or not pulsatile: then press forward, and fill the place with the ground I advised, and release it tightly for two days or three, until the wound putrefies and the blood ebullition ceases: then return to applying that which remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ Concerning external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are forms of Intromittents among these, and there are three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Among them, there is the large one, among them there is the medium one, and among them there is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron with square ends that taper inward, so they can easily enter the incision site.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiments, and not this, namely, piercing tools: and one of them is called "bur," that is, piercing; and there are three species of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Among these, there is the large one, there is the medium one, and there is the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They should be examined through the incisions, discharges, and fistulas, as well as swellings from what is between them derived from bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles where there are grooves for them, from citrine stone, or air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better things are those that happen from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And even experiences happen regarding the black lead, which suit to use them for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity are reflections, so they reflect with their smoothness like those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three types once more.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them there are those that are long, those that are medium, and those that are short, according to the size of the fistula's width and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of darts, and there are many types of it.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them there are simples ones, that is to say, where there's only one curvature: and there are three types as you see, the Large, the Middle-sized, and the Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are Blind Darts: and there are three types of it.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are Darts with two curves, and there are three types of it. And from them there are Darts with three curves, and there are three types of it. All these are necessary in their respective places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scrape the nodes and ulcers. And there are three types of it, because from them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends which are made for cutting are sharp, other ends are not sharp: they are not used like this, unless with them an aid is made in scraping the nodes at the fear of incision on veins or nerves; and it heals through them the sick one, and finds a momentary peace from the warmth he found when scraping ulcers.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the Magda, and there are three types of it.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from metal and resemble a radiating shape like that used to make alcohol. At the wider end there is an indented point of the spatulum hidden: and it flows both towards the internal organs and externally when needed, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the spatulum (Spatumilium) which is hidden among the fingers during puncture for smallpox: and the ill do not perceive these. And there are three kinds of it, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the Ventrilagi (Ventosarum) with which the blood flow is cut off: and there are three kinds of them, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made from air or lemon, round in shape, somewhat long as you see fit, and be fine in thickness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	These should be the two kinds of Ventrilagi that you have available - large and small - so that with them you can cut off blood flow at speed when necessary, and then use them when medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting out of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fatty parts: like on thighs, hips, arms, breasts, stomach, groin areas, and similar places from fatty areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they make small instruments similar to surgical knives out of them, according to their shape; with which blood is cut when it flows from the phlebotomy site or at a cut artery or vein: and sometimes they make them round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Section on the care of human breasts that resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Title 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some humans swell at the onset of sleep (that is, when they begin to bleed during sleep), until they resemble women's breasts. And they remain disfigured by smallpox.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever avoids that, they must cut over the nipples at the lunar section, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the entire fatty deposit.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with ointment from the incised flesh.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then attach both edges of the wound to the stitches and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple declines downwards and becomes softer due to its size, as happens with women: then it must be cut in two sides at the top with two similar cuts of the lunar shape, each kept together with the other at their ends until a longer line contains the shorter one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards scrape off the skin which is between the two edges and remove the fatty deposit, and apply what we have said about stitches and powders, that is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not complete the incision that needs to be made due to the anxiety of the patient or bleeding: then you must fill the wound with a moistened corrosive ointment and let it go until it corrodes what has remained from the fatty deposit.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	For the perforation by arrows, which happens under the scrotum.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These arrows which occur under the scrotum are of the species of Strophularia and contain seeds, and among them are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those among them that contain moisture must be treated with a cut at the lunar section, according to this form, from line b. to line g. Once the whole of what is in the arrowhead has been washed out by urine, then fill it with an old rag until the following day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then, the wound is opened, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If it should be an abscess of the variety of nodes from the Strophula plant, then divide above it as we said in the section on dividing Strophula plants equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If it happens that the wound spreads to such an extent as to expel pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously addressed.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Section of Abscesses that occurs due to the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, it often results in an abscess forming there: similarly, it happens with veins as well, where an abscess may form and inflation occur.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one can recognize that an abscess and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are as follows: because when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long, aggregated deep in the body, and if you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sound like scratching.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round and prominent on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting this abscess is a mistake, especially if it's under the axilla, groin, neck and many other parts of the body; it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its care must be performed with the iron, and that which is also present in the extremities or at the head must also be treated accordingly.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, with regard to that which comes from the inflammation of the artery's opening, find out the location by making a cut in the skin along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then make an incision with a hook, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is revealed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the tool under it and make it penetrate up to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread at two places according to what I taught you in removing two arteries which are located within.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place which is between two ligaments and testicles until all the blood within it flows out, and let the abscess be discharged.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off: afterwards care with suitable ointments applied to it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess together with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate. And put a doubled thread into it until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the good incision of the abscess: as I told you about the uterus ligament, from both parts with both ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with a different thread under the abscess all around the needle insertion: press and tighten your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its center until when it discharges what is inside. Then remove excess skin, and release what has been tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put the paste that you have been holding under it in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer care, which is done with oils and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On what happens due to the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, similarly an abscess can occur in nerves: what happens to them is a blow or occurs from excessive exertion, and such things, and it happens to them mostly in the auxiliary areas, heels, and in any place where joints move: and it is a heavy abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body and it appears in various positions without pain: and when it is tightened with disorientation, one feels a kind of illness within it akin to stupefaction.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a lumped together abscess within the depth of the body, no, it's beneath the skin, and it moves towards every part, and it doesn't extend to previous ones, or ahead, nor backwards to latter parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So what is there between joints should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, a contraction might happen, however.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that case, what is there from them in the head or on the forehead, remove the skin with the suture thread.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is an abscess that's small, then hold it with forceps, and remove it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off: afterwards remove it, and apply a dressing with stitches until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the excision of abscesses, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Head LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often experience lumps in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, which they call mushrooms, similar to them with fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is fine, and their head is large, and their lips are conversed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is scarce from them; and there is a great magnification from them.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two testicles, which resembled mushrooms more than other things; there was no difference between them, white, fine roots, and their lips inverted, and they would stick out, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I came across this and found that in one of them it weighed as if about X and VIII ounces, and in the other about VI ounces. The operation for the treatment on their incisions is something you should consider then: if a sick person is moist, and the color of the testicles is white, moist, fine-rooted; then cut him off with broad spatulas and have a cauterizing fire ready for your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Indeed, quite a bit of blood is often expelled during the sectioning of it: so if you are overcome by the blood, then apply cauterization to it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a sick, fearful and timid person reacting to the incision with the iron, then take a lead wire that has been made unevenly, and bind it with it using anathelul technique: this is as we said, and release him after two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead in the wound dressing.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease binding lead as long as it prints on the testicles, until it is cut and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the testicles have large roots, then there is something of fear and poverty in the incision: primarily that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you may cut halfway through him.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, so that he does not relapse.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware of perceiving a spot that is yellow in color, with few sensations and an unpleasant appearance: for this is a cancerous boil: and I will cure it with the recollection of Cancer afterwards.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	¶ On the care for the prominence of the Navel.
Caput LII.	Head 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The prominence of the Navel arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or it comes from the fissures of the scrotum, which is above the stomach: and it exits through there into the belly, or the intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or it comes from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, according to what has been mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or it comes from constriction of the stomach in this area.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to the scrotal fissure and the expulsion of pus: then its color resembles that of the body's color: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the expulsion of the intestine, then its location, together with what we have narrated, exhibits a greater variety.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound accompanying it: and it becomes greatly prominent at the entry of the bath, and severe labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	However, if it is due to moisture, it is soft, then when you press it with your hand, it does not disappear, nor does it tighten, nor is added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs, the boil appears to be turning towards blackness at the root.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is because of flesh grown: then it is a heavy pustule, a lump, hard and forms according to quantity one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it's due to windiness, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is as you will understand, then if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or windiness: then you must refrain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and panic, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that pustules are due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	And if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or grass (possibly referring to some form of plant), then you should advise the patient that they must hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then, with the application of hot wax around the entire circumference of the navel area.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then advise him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then, surround with a broad poultice around the circumference of the navel over the spot you marked with hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend half of the pustule upwards, using a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it tightly around with strong string or a firm silk ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be well made.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	And then open the middle part of the pustule that has been extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find it has already been released from the ligament: then extract it carefully, and insert your index finger into it to push the intestines back into the abdomen. And if you find grass (possibly referring to some form of plant), then take it with a hook and cut off any excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however, contrary is against you artery or vein, then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles into the surrounding area you made around the pustule in a manner of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	And pull the pustule in four places above the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the place heal until the flesh is fully putrid: and it falls off by itself: or cut it down when it becomes thinner and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	And then take care of it with what is needed from the ointment until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	And if the protrusion of the navel is from the flesh hole in it, or from dampness: then it must be that you incise the pustule, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find inside it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	And then take care of it with what strengthens the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	§ On the care of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LI.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the division of species of Cancer and how to proceed with its treatment using medicines. We must be careful when dealing with its treatment using iron so as not to cause it to ulcerate. We also mentioned the generated Cancer in the womb, and caution about treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer can be found in a place where its removal is possible: such as the Cancer found in breasts or thigh, and others like them, from positions on the body to remove the whole of it. Especially when it starts small and diminutive.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When you decide that it is old, and it is large, do not approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I, however, was unable to heal anyone from this: nor did I see anyone before me who had recovered to that extent.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in this case, when it is localized as we said, is that you should precede and relieve the diseased person from black choler at intervals.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the bloodletting tool with obvious fullness, proceed.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Next, prepare the patient with preparation that includes instructions for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then produce in the jawbone (cancrum) the ones that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Next, hollow out the entire part with skin according to examination until nothing remains from its roots: and allow blood to flow without removing it quickly, but instead squeeze the areas and remove all thick blood using your hands or whatever is possible with tools available there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the thick flow of blood impedes you from the incision of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood can be removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ Concerning the cure of Water Distention (Hydrops).
Caput LIIII.	Title 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have now discussed the division of types of Water Distention (Hydrops), and how water accumulation occurs. We've also covered the signs for all types, and the treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is nothing but the Asclitan type alone: and it does not approach the Timpanitic or Hyposacral types with iron, for that would be lethal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of Water Distention (Hydrops) with medicines and the treatment has not alleviated it, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if she has already become weak, or there is another weakness with her besides hydrophobia: such as if there is a cough with her, or an abdominal issue, and similar conditions; then refrain from treating her with iron: for this does cause alarm.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you observe a sick person with excessive strength, and there is no other ailment besides hydrophobia: nor is it a child or an old person: then the way to operate on him is that you lift the sick person between your hands while standing, and the assistant pushes his abdomen with their hand towards the lower part of the body, emptying out water with pincers.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take the thorny reed, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let there be two sharp parts, it should be long, with the tip being as sharp as a thorny reed.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there must be some slight limitation in it over time, so that you do not proceed with the operation until the intestines, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if hydrophobia arises from the part of the intestines, then you must extend with your section from the navel by a length of three fingers, downwards directly towards his abdomen.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	However, if the generation of hydrophobia is due to an illness in the liver: then your section should be three fingers to the left from the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its origin is due to the spleen, then the section should be on the right side. And it's also not necessary for the section to be made on the side where the sick person wants to lie down, so that no excesses flow towards this weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then puncture with your tool the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then enter into that division and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and do it as if you were scratching yourself: and let the amount to be scratched be the size of a nail or roughly so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce and do it until the spatula reaches the empty place: and there is a place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or metal, or alloyed with tin, smooth and clean. There is a small hole at the lower part of it, and three holes are on its sides, two from one side, and one from the other. The end of it is incised in accordance with the shape of the tip of a reed, as you can see; there is a ring at the upper end of it.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	So when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument itself, therefore evacuating a quantity of water that is equal at any given time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, at some point the patient might die due to the release of his body's vital spirits: or something that approaches death may happen to him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	However, evacuate from it according to the strength of its nature, and according to what your patients indicate to you based on their pulse strength and health.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is because it gets retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening above the spatula: about which I have spoken, in order to pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then use the same method with the instrument on another day, if you see that the patient can tolerate this. And also extract a small amount of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Perform this for a few days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until nothing remains of the water but a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If you are afraid for the weak one and remove a large amount from the water, then take care of it with burial in hot sand, excessive sweat in a bath and sunlight, and wait until it recovers. And take care of it with dried medicines until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and appendix after the removal of water: according to what I have described in what preceded this.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ On caring for infants born at locations where their urine areas are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Head 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone among infants emerges from their mother's womb, and the head of its hair is not pierced, or there is a narrowed opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist immediately with the perforation of its skin when it is born, using a thin spatula, according to this manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin bronze key in the opening and tie it. Hold it for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When then desires to urinate, remove the key, and let her urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put it back in place.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the site will prevent the key from being able to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	And that one whose opening is narrowed is treated with lead as we said, for many days, until it expands.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	And those among them who have the opening not in its proper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening of those born is at the end of the head (i.e., the location where hair grows): therefore, it cannot join with the front parts until their head rises to the higher parts with their own hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	There is no generation for him, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the womb in straightness: and there is a very nasty illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the manner of its performance is such that the sick person is laid upon his own back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend your left hand with the rod and strike its head forcefully. Incise at the place of the penis, using the tip or a sharp edge, like making an incision with a knife, or like you would cut something to obtain the middle part similar to the head of the rod; and let there be a hole in the middle as it should fall.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this happens many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So oppose him with what is used to stop the bleeding, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	¶ Concerning the issues that occur in the foreskin and head of the rod, as well as decay, darkening, and stickiness.
Caput LVI.	Title 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Such events happen to the rod very often, and it is an abominable condition of the flesh that is nasty.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from this, there is another that is evil, and another that is not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So, for the non-evasive one, you should hang it with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place its tip submerged in Egyptian oil.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	And then take care of it afterwards with the oil until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the disease is evil and has a nasty color, then you should apply cautery to it after making its cut and the reason for its application.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If Albaather is found within the foreskin of a circumcised individual and there are parts of Albaather inside as well as outside between the foreskin and the body; then you should remove the internal part of Albaather until it solidifies. After that, take care of removing the external part: for when you treat them together at once, the foreskin is in danger of tearing.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And accidents also happen in the testicles, and the darkened and corrupted foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must remove everything that has already become discolored, and what intends to corrupt or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then place a line over it after that with honey mixed with flour ground by millstones and the grain of grinding mills, and herbs crushed by a sifter.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that along with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however there is bleeding, then apply the cauterizing tool with the lunar cauterizer, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cauterizer is useful for two simultaneous applications, namely to stop bleeding and to treat a wound when it has become corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the tip of the staff becomes corrupted and is destroyed completely by hour: then you should introduce a lead pipe into the prepuce, so that the sick person can bathe over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	Regarding the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the staff, and indeed this kind of adherence does not occur unless in someone whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on top of it: sometimes adherence occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore you should remove that together with an obtuse Spatumili (a medical tool), until the ligament dissolves and the head of the staff becomes free from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape out something from the head of the spear and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because the prepuce, when it is subtle, may perhaps be pierced due to its subtlety and quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the spear with a fine linen cloth that has already been made wet in cold water so they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with red wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ On the purification of infants and treatment after errors happen to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution for continence like other wounds; however, since it comes from our operation, according to our will, and its use is proper for infants, there must be an indication of a better procedure in that operation and a way that leads easier to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore, that the ancients did not declare circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we acquire through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have found that a larger part of the artisans and phlebotomists use purification through circumcision when they are newborns and with clamps. They also use gauze, tie them with thread, and cut with the hoof.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed, I have tried all these methods and did not find purification to be better with clamps, or tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because during purification with newborns, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: so perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower remains. It's forced to make an incision for the other layer which will cause pain in the future.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the castration performed by emasculating, that is, by using a digital tool as surgeons do, does not secure the cut at the end of the male member: because perhaps it enters through its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	And in the case of castration through the use of a hoof, perhaps it allows iron, and corrupts your operation: and indeed, the nature of children's skin is short, and they are often born in such a way that they do not require castration: and I have seen this already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The results of castration using forceps and ligament with thread have given me good experience: because the forceps are proportional to the cut: therefore, the sharpness above is as the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	And when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they intersect simultaneously during one operation: and a compression similar figure is created, containing the rod-like skin from every part, with which no error falls entirely.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is such that you should let it be understood by those who are knowledgeable to a certain extent, if they are among them, for which you do not have until you tie the thread in his rod only: and dismiss him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad as much as possible to you that which he receives with his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not let him be sitting: and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to his rod and blow into the skin, and draw it up until the tip of the rod comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from what is attached to it in dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then join the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Next, join below it with a ligament of about the same size.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb, the place of the lower ligament's retention well, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards or quickly, and pull out the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow out gradually (which is better), and place the wadding above: and on top of the wadding put a piece of cloth in which the yolk has been spread and cooked in water that has turned red, mixed with rose oil. With the recent good progress: and let him rest on it until another day: and care for himself with the remaining treatment, until he heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	And this is the form for cutting during cleansing.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two sharp ends, and they should be parallel: so that no branch of the clamp escapes in them: and let its length be equal to the length of two pencil points each.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, an error occurs during cleansing: because perhaps the entire inner skin or part of it escapes at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you must extend it from the time of your own hour with your finger before the division point: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with the hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it goes beyond three days and there remains what is under the rod inflated, divided; then remove that until the scab becomes warm, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how you are prepared for it: and beware from above the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that reason, it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Thus treat that along with what hardens the wound from powders as we have described in the chapter on powders. And if it extends beyond the skin up to the measure and spreads upwards, even that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	So treat that along with what we said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Chapter on the removal of retained Vrina in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Head 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to congestion caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh that has grown and similar things from what we have discussed regarding methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not relieve itself and he is seen to have a retention due to the stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it should be expected that he will have been laid out on his knees for the operation.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back and he should stretch his abdomen from the upper part of his back. The patient should hold his breathing as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He is therefore forced to move the neck of the bladder in order to expel the stone towards the backside, thus allowing urine to flow.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not relieve itself with what we have said and causes discomfort to the patient, then you should administer its extraction with a tool called a syringe, which has this form - made of silver, is thin, smooth, concave like a small tube as thin as a bird's feather quill in thickness, about as long as a person's palm from the wrist to the end of the fingers and the second joint, and it should have a delicate tube at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the manner of the expulsion of urine through it is as follows: you should take a double thread and bind good linen or wool to its end. You will then insert the end of this thread into the lower part of the syringe. If there's any excess wool coming out, you'll remove that using forceps, but when you are ready for expulsion, you will gently push through the narrow canal as if squeezing a sponge.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then immerse the syringe in oil or with butter, and albugine. And have the patient sit on a seat, and immerse the bladder, and his staff with moist oils, and oil of olive, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the staff with ease until it reaches the root of the staff.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double that (the operation or procedure) above at the belly side, near the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into that (the affected area) until it reaches the bladder, and the patient should feel that the instrument has already reached its target: and this operation is not performed in this order unless the opening through which it goes is in the place where there is curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Indeed, moisture follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the moisture run through the urine way: and repeatedly use the syringe, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient will experience relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ Concerning the quality of urinary enemas with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LI.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a wound occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals within it, or pus is obstructed within it, and water and medicines are distilled into it: then this is done with the tool that is called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	Indeed, it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And within it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you will see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place where this pushes is set according to the amount that pushes itself without addition, until when something is drawn with it, moisture is drawn out: and when it is pushed, whatever is pushed out goes far away: just like Clepshydra does, which expels naphtha, that is, Greek fire in military affairs.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you want to force the moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the hyposmotic into the moisture and draw out with it whatever is being pushed upwards; for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the hyposmotic.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the rod, as we told you about in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Next force the moisture with what is being pushed by that; for the moisture immediately reaches the bladder in such a way that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of the slender catheter through which the bladder is washed out.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it of silver or a mixture of gold and ivory; let the head be higher shaped like a small cradle, and under it is to have a sinus where a ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder on the reed and place in it the moisture with which you wish to wash out the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinuses with a strong knot made of double thread, and heat that moisture moderately over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the catheter into the rod, afterwards press your hand on the bladder with the moisture until it is tight, up to when the patient feels that this moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into these holes as they twist.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle as one would gather cloth: after you place in it that which you wish from the moisture and oils and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it into an implement: and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the Extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Head 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have spoken about the division of species of stone, and its care with surgeons: and we spoke about the distinction between the stone formed in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of it as a whole; and we spoke about the stone where an operation is performed by hand and cutting. The stone that forms specifically in the bladder is called such: and that which is formed into a rod. And I am narrating this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say then that the stone formed in the bladder happens to many children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs, it appears that urine comes out of the bladder like water in its fineness: and white sand is seen in it; and an invalid man wields his stick upon it, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised up and comes out along with them in many of their cases.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it becomes difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people however, it is of medium difficulty, which lies between that. And the healing is easier for one who has a larger stone: and if it's small, it's the opposite care.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	So when we come to healing, it is necessary first of all, to cleanse the invalid with a cataplasma, which will remove all the feces that are in his intestines: for sometimes this prevents discovery of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken with his feet and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or be discharged from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his elbows, so that the whole bladder may incline downwards towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in its place, then proceed immediately with your operation above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wash the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a child. Or use the middle finger if he is an adult and complete. Then insert it into his anus and examine for the stone until it lies under your finger: and gradually turn him to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then apply pressure with your finger on it and push it towards the outside against the place of its section: and instruct your assistant to press the bladder with his hand. And tell another assistant to extend his right hand's testicles up to the top, and have him use his other hand to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where there is a cut.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the incising spatula, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find what is between the anus and testicles within him, not in the middle, towards the left side: and let the cut be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make a transverse cut so that the external cut is wide and the internal cut tight, according to the possibility of allowing ejection of the stone from there without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed, if the finger that is in the anus compresses the stone at the cut and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you will know that from a stone which has angles and margins, it becomes difficult for its release because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that, it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its release becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for him who has angles and margins, add into the crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit like this, then you must contrive something over it: or tie something over it as you pull away from the center, where one end is like the Moon which ties over the stone and does not come out of it. Or you can insert a subtle instrument under it, with its curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot do it over with, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	And if something is tied to you by some blood, cut it off while saying this.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stone is more than one, then push the largest first into the mouth of the vesicle.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then fall upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Next, push in something smaller after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	And if the large one is very much, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the weak one of two things, either he will die, or he suffers from constant urine distillation: for that reason, because the place is not thoroughly consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it exits: or contrive in its fracture with forceps until you extract him suddenly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	And when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tie it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or oil rose-scented, and cold water: so that the sore heals from the warm pus.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then supine the patient on his neck, and do not only ligature the band until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	And when you have freed him, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the person with dyaphanic ointment and basil ointment until they heal.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however an abscess occurs in the wound with heat added and corrosive substances, or anything similar: as if blood becomes congealed in a bladder and urine is prevented from coming out: and it is known by the discharge of blood mixed with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes decay of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then cleanse the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply to it whatever is suitable from the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary to consider the hours of the entire treatment period; you should bind two thighs and bundles, because of the medicines that are placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	And if the stone is small and located in the middle of the urinary canal, and becomes stuck in it, preventing urine from passing through: then treat him with what I will instruct you before you reach cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, many times by this treatment after the cut, we have already proven this method to be effective.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you should take the perforating tool from iron, which has this shape: with triangular ends and pointed, fixed into wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with the rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert a piercing iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone: and rotate the Perforator with your hand within the stone gradually: and narrow the perforation, until you cause it to penetrate from another part.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is cleaned immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand onto what remains of the stone from the outer part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks itself, and comes out with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut through the stone in the rod between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards untie the bandage and cleanse the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the blister: and another thread above, unless so that when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and cooperates with the wound: for this reason, you need this when you tie the thread above, in order to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion and cooperates with the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ On the removal of the stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Title LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is formed less in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone occurs in any of them, then treatment is difficult and prohibited because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will show herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those with husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's place: which requires deep cutting, and there is fear involved.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which, if necessity prompts you to do that, then it is necessary that you take a female doctor, well known for her skills: and she is not often found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you remove her, then seek out a chaste doctor, subtle, and present her to the experienced female obstetrician who is well versed in matters of women's health, or a woman who has taken up part of this art. Therefore, make her present herself, and especially instruct her that she should do everything you have instructed her according to the examination about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that she should inspect whether the woman is a virgin: then it must be that she inserts her finger into the woman's anus and seeks out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	And if she has found it, bind him under her own finger, and then instruct the obstetrician to insert his finger into the weak woman's womb, and inquire about the stone after placing his left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good grip.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	And if she has found the stone, then it must be that she moves it gradually from the urethral opening to below with her greatest strength, until she reaches it with him to the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut over it at the midpoint of the womb near the root of the thigh, from any preparation side to him and feels the stone in that part; and his finger does not move away from the stone, binding under it: and let the first section be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert the rod onto that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels a stone, then according to the quantity in proportion to which the stone comes out of it, he shall add to that section.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the appearance of stones is many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these, it is slender and large, soft and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	And know its appearance so that you can understand it through this regarding what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place of zinc, ground, and keep it for an hour until the blood is expelled.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do so that you prepare with you from tools, which I said in the removal of stones in men, so that you assist with those during your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put the powder on the place and tie it with a bandage suitable for powders: and do not remove this; and release the stone, but do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed, the frail woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then attend to the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	And when the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place decays, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ Regarding sectioning above the aqueous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Head LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The aqueous ramus is not present, unless it is an aggregation of moisture within the white sifacum, which is beneath the skin containing the oum: and this is called sifacum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes there is a natural appendage to it for itself within the scrotum, which nature prepared in its place until it appears: which is another thing of the testis and is the skin of the testicles between the white sac that we said about; and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this branch is from weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this material flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens due to impact upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color declines to a yellowish tone, or it is blood-red, or feculent, black, or it is watery white, and this latter thing is more so.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where there is an accumulation of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is the white sac that we said about, then the pustule is round approximately as long as the size of a testicle: and there appears no testicle, because the moisture contains him from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is within its own scrotal sac, then the pustule is round with a portion of a testicle, and because of this, man judges that it is another thing of the testis.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under perception.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you wish to know the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture within the pustule with an inserted square, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, judging what is between them according to the one that emerges into investigation with insertion.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you give the sick a bloodletting if possible, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is inflated over its back on top of a slight higher surface, and place many cloths under it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit beside its left side, and instruct your attendant to sit on the right side of it, who will extend the rod towards one or both sides of the scrotal skin, and towards a part below the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take the spatula and cut through the skin of the testicles from the middle longitudinally, almost to the pubic hair. Make a cut according to the line which divides the testicle skin equally until you reach the white part containing the sperm ducts. Scrap out and inspect it, or if there is pus present, remove that portion: and let your scraping be in the area where the scrap is done when hanging with the egg more. Carefully examine the scraping according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then puncture the white part full of fluid with an opening large enough to pass water through, and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two parts of the scrotum with scissors and extend it upwards, without touching the skin that covers the testicles. And cut the white part as much as you can or even completely, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no certainty that the water has been removed from the cut.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the sperm duct extends outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the cut of the testicle, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two parts of the scrotal skin with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like any other wound until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a diseased sperm duct due to another cause, then you must tie the threads which are used for suspension, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut out the testicle with its suspension and remove the prostate gland: afterwards take care of that along with what we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is aggregated into two parts, then you will know that there are two branches. Therefore, cut off another part as you did in the other one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it matches for you, like there is an operation as one whole, then do: afterwards clean off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert it into a piece of cloth submerged in oil, or in rose-scented oil. Then place another piece of cloth below the one you submerged in wine and oil, and spread that over the two testicles, and cover with a cloth bundle: then place above them doubled cloths, which are to be called 'pulleys': and bind these above with the ligament, which has six parts according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, soak them, and fill each with red dyed yarn according to this likeness: then make the ends which are pressed from the stomach or wet wool. They should be bound together with a bandage at the level of the buttocks. One end shall cover the anus up to the back, and the other end will cover the pubic area. The two remaining ends go over the lower thighs, and the other two go over the inguinal regions; the whole binding is made tight at the level of the buttocks.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And at times this branch is treated artificially with a cautery in place of the section with iron. And it should be that you take the surgical knife and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is lit as we have described: until when the white membrane containing water is revealed, then take the cautery according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then puncture together with that siphon, and let it be ignited until all moisture has escaped.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the siphon with hooks and scrape it off with a fine heated cautery tool. Cut it down as much as possible for you until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And draw from the egg, let the fire not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you will know that this operation is safer, lasts longer without bleeding, and is better than an operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if contrary effects are caused to you during the hour of cutting or the application of heat after cutting, or bleeding, or any other issue: then it is necessary that you treat what causes the contrary effect with the appropriate treatment for it, according to what has been prescribed.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is timid and does not anticipate this operation because of its horror, then administer the puncture as I have instructed: and it will be done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are informed by you about the meaning of what we said regarding signs, that the rod is watery: then it is necessary to make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the abscess from the lower part with a broad spoon-like instrument: and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let it be an open wound until all water has drained.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pad over the area and bind it, then let him go so that the rest of the water can drain out: then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if contrary effects are caused by the ejection of water during the puncturing of it: and that is not due to any other reason, because a white cloth causes contrary effects at the wound opening and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary for you to insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument used to drain excess water from hydroptics which has a similar shape beforehand: or add this temporarily during the operation on the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you will know that water returns and aggregates around six months, or about then.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	And when it aggregates, then the sick will be cured in the same manner, and the patient will pass their diseased days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Section: Care for the affected flesh.
Caput LXIII.	Head 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	And you will understand that in this section about the ram, there is a loss through fear leading to danger in various dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me beneficial for its release from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall the operation performed on it and the kind of sheep.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many conditions occur in sheep bodies, from which the testicles are formed: and this happens due to various causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute overproduction, or intensity, which is discharged towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from impact.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of sheep's scabs corresponds to the color of their body, and no pain is found for it: and a sheep scab is heavy.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone scab with a dark brown color and no sensation for it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs due to the knotting of arteries and their dilation; as has already been recalled in this case: or from the dilation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	And what is caused by dilation of arteries can be recognized by the arrangement of sheep's scabs when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which occurs due to the dilation of veins does not get dispersed when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that on this kind of structure a section may be made, and on other muscles; and there exists the separation of the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Next extend the penis upwards and pull out the whole including its white layer; and release the suspensory ligament from the scrotum, then tie it back onto the scrotum. And cut through the suspensory ligament after you have freed the whole structure from all parts of the body.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the penis is hardened together with those born muscles, then it must be held back and cut through the penis.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if adhesion is present between some of the ligaments, or within what exists among the ligaments: then it must be that you free the entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	And if birth of the flesh is in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it must be that you cut through all of it, and pull out the penis as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with gauze soaked in rose oil and wine. Next care for it along with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ Care of Rhabdies, which is related to Vitis.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It refers to a pus pocket that has withdrawn due to a certain withdrawal process, resembling a lump, when the testicles are softened: and it results in difficulty with the patient's movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is from caution, due to that which preceded it and is recalled.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, we should say the operation for this according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I therefore say that you should make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the testicle suspension towards below.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the means which are close to the staff: and another servant should hold them and extend them forcefully.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp incision across diagonally through the veins until the veins are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Next, scrape off from all sides as we have instructed you in the removal of arteries which are in the cavities.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then, insert the tip of your needle with a double thread and tie it at the first places where you encounter wires: then re-tie it at the last of those.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle with a straight longitudinal section and remove what accumulates from the decomposing feculent humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Next, take care of the wound with the same care as for other wounds where it is necessary to prevent infection, so that the veins nourishing one testicle may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm in this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the veins are in all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove them for this reason: so that no organ lacks nourishment due to the cut and becomes diseased, or gets worse, and does not benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	### On the care of the intestinal loops.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The result of this is an event that occurs with the extension, which happens above the abdomen in the part behind the groin from below the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture can either be from a suture, or from its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen due to many causes. Or by percussion. Or by jumping. Or by crying out. Or by lifting heavy objects, and similar actions.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it occurs from stretching of stitches.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is when something happens gradually over a long period of time and does not occur suddenly; there will be an equal amount of pus towards the depth: because stitches are compressing the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of this is when it occurs due to the cutting of stitches because it causes a severe sudden pain at the beginning: and there will be a different pus, appearing beneath the skin closely: and that is because of the exit of the intestine and its movement towards the external stitches.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with the intestine bubble: and this is called Intestinal Ramus, and the bubble: and sometimes it happens with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it flows into the intestine with feces and is retained there: and this occurs together with weakness in sick people: because it causes a dull pain to occur, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of symptoms of this illness with iron there is fear: therefore it must be avoided in that situation.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is to guide the sick person, so that they can use their hand to bring the intestine back inside their concave body if it has responded to return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then you should cover his neck with your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin above, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along the length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two cutting edges like hooks, according to what you need for opening the cut with them: and make the cut according to as much as is possible, so that it may come out from there cleanly.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the scrotum, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphak fat is exposed, hard all over: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak fat, which is under the skin, and the latter siphak; and completely adhere to it, with respect to the posterior part of the testicles.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then with your right hand draw out to the inner skin of the testicles: and when this is done expand the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and lift up the scrotum together with the siphak; and instruct the assistant to pull the scrotum upwards: and you then resolve the adhesion which is behind completely.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to ensure that there is nothing from the intestine entwined in the white hard siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find something from there: then push it downwards towards the belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a hook in which there is a thick thread made from a ligament of ten threads, and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the membrane which follows the cut under the testicle skin: then cut off the protruding ends of the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over the others with a shape in the manner of a cross: and tie it to that siphak which we mentioned, because it is a ligament very strongly under the testicle skin, until no amount from below can send anything upwards to them: so as not to happen any pus swelling there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And again place the second ligature after the first one, extending two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures cut out the one that is under the scrotal skin, in the size of a finger: and cut the rest all along roundness, and remove it from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Next, cut in the lower part of the scrotal skin at the point from which blood flows out, and stitch it smoothly as we have explained in what was mentioned earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Next, apply wadding that has been soaked in oil and place it in the wound: and apply the ligament as we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes what we said about that white part is cauterized after the cut, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this happens many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And remove the ligature until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however the situation doesn't progress, then it should be treated with warm water: and place that which we mentioned above upon it until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the treatments for wounds until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Chapter on windy rash.
Caput LXVI.	Title LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this windy rash, I have not heard of anyone who has been brave enough to use iron in its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happens as we have described for the windy rash that is with Vine syndrome.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, you bind the bandage after cutting over it with ease below: then cut in the middle, and finally take care of the wound according to what we opened up until the bandages fall off: and take care of the wound as described until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the dissection that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Title LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and a place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is insufficient and returns at all times. However, if the process extends with that time, an opening is added into the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens with the extension of the sifach that is located in the groins as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That happens because the sifach is extended; afterwards, the place softens and becomes inflamed, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously described.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: and it happens that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then, cut the site of the rupture, including the softened and protruding area, making a cut across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the saphenous vein and the ones beneath the skin until you expose the white saphenous artery which is located underneath the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the artery and place it over the protruding part from the saphenous vein, and press it down to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then place two protruding areas over the end of the artery from the saphenous vein, and connect one of them with a stitch to the other: then remove the end of the artery.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the saphenous vein entirely, nor stretch it or anything else as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal worms.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then concern yourself with this treatment for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	And when you have hit the string, cleanse that, and restore the wound until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Therefore, it is contracted, and not added to, the eminence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On softening of the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The scrotal skin of some individuals is softened frequently for this reason, which also softens the flesh that lies between them, and spoils its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is requested to treat this, that he make the patient lie on his back, and apply the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, begin by removing any excess of the softened skin with three stitches, or four, and secure the stitches firmly.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then make your cuts between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	And then continue with the treatment of the remaining wounds until they heal completely, and remove the stitches when necessary.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is condemned in our law and for that reason it was permissible for me not to mention it in my book, and there is no need to recall it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be knowledge for the doctor when he is asked about it, and that he knows how to treat those who may encounter this.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefits such as oxen, goats, cats and similar from beasts.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I therefore say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through making a crack and a section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the case where castration is performed through attrition, the procedure goes as follows: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and become more relaxed and hang down. Then with your hand, you scrape them off until they dissolve and no longer appear upon touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In the case of castration through making a crack and a section, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the hanging ligature and cut across all sections once, until when two eggs start to develop. Then perform it after you have shaved both sides, but do not leave anything above except for a thin cut, which is on the skin.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done through attrition because possibly some part may remain from the testicles after the attrition process, which could make the animal desire copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ Concerning the care of Hermaphrodites in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite can be formed from males in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of these is that it appears within him as follows: either there's a space visible or where the scrotum skin is, between two testicles, he bears a shape like a woman having hair: and sometimes urine flows out of what's inside the scrotum skin.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women however there is one type of feature, and resembles a woman's pubis like the small testicles of men, protruding to the external: one of which is like the penis of men, and two resemble two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for three types, two from men and one from women, is: because it must happen that you hit the added flesh until their impression escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for these injuries with the remaining treatment of wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is inside the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and there is no complete treatment for it.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ Concerning incisions to the Tentigine (or scrotum) and protruding flesh in the women's vulva.
Caput LXXI.	Title 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentigine might be added over the natural condition until it is severed and its appearance becomes unpleasant. And sometimes it is magnified in certain women to such an extent that it expands like in men, reaching up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should hold the excess of the Tentigine with your hand or using a small tool and cut it. And do not stop at the cutting point particularly deep within the root to prevent bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat that wound according to the treatment of wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Flesh arising is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it. And perhaps protrudes to the outside like a tail according to its resemblance, hence some call the first condition 'tailish ailment'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should treat it like you would the Tentigine and heal it until it is cured.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the care of the Alarica, which is an unperforated woman's wound.
Caput LXXII.	Title 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica refers to an unperforated woman's wound or one with a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accidental Alratica is due to illness that preceded it: and indeed, it happens either from flesh naturally added, or from a thin one, or a thick one: and it occurs either deeply in the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it: and it prevents intercourse and fertilization, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	The knowledge of that happens through the appearance of obstetrical symptoms, if pregnancy seems to be close by.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek for it with your fingers, or with the aid of a tool.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if pregnancy is due to the thin one and it is close between two lips; then approach, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And do as if you were placing them over two small lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the tips of both hands together, and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch both lips with strength until the thin one is broken and pregnancy opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot. And let the woman copulate every day to prevent the spot from hardening instead of other things.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the thin one is thick and dense; then it must be removed together with the secretions using a broad leaf similar to that of the laurel.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the amputation is natural from flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it. And have with you medicine that stops blood flow without cauterization, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and when mixed with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a large leaden pipette so that the wound does not clot or heal too quickly, hold it for several days. Then administer linseed oil, and afterwards treat the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes births occur that are of other flesh within the mother's womb. Therefore, according to this method they must be cut open: it should not form a pustule for one would not apply metal to cancerous matter, which is in contrast with applying iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the care of hemorrhoids, Atsilhelil, and both of the red [conditions] in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	Title 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of blood vessels, until much blood flows from them continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids occur, they become Atsilhelil: and I have already said about them in the division of their types and signs. And here I will say which receive treatment from them, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear by touch: then there is no treatment with iron for her.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	And those which are from them that appear on the opening of the womb when touch can perceive them, are those that receive treatment.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, you must make the woman enter into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then apply Atsilhelil with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then crush over them at the blood flow with one of the powder instruments without causing necrosis: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and myrrh, and similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push his feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then place it in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persisted: then make her sit in a concoction of sumac, and coriander seeds, and gall stones, and similar remedies.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take the flour of barley, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it to be placed on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is drawn with it, it is good: and if not, make suction cups stick to her back and breasts without incisions.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tamarisk, or in the juice of ox舌头, or in the sap of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it stick to a pessary.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the blistering ceases, then care for the place with ointment until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is reddish in color and resembles an onion, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should cut what is visible from it as I said for thyme equally: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	For perforation of the uterus that occurs in pregnancy.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various types of blisters can occur in the womb, such as cancer, and blister of stones, and ulcers, and reddening, and hardening, that is, herpes, and heat rash, and abscesses, and hemorrhoids, and varicose veins, and thyme, and warm blister.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already spoken about all these illnesses and their types, and the symptoms of them, and their treatments in this division. It is necessary to say that concerning this subject matter, there arises a hot pus when it is from pus discharges which gather disease, and one must know how its incision occurs with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain in a pus pocket at its inception is sharp with its impact, and heat, and fever: and you see it turn red; if sensation falls upon it, then do not press hard with puncturing it: and treat it with what helps in maturation until when the intensity of incidents subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which supports two seats underneath her buttocks, and reclines, or ties her over her back, and places her feet below her lower abdomen: and let her knees be spread out, and she should place her arms under her thighs, and tie both with the ligaments to this.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then, the midwife sits on the right side, and prepares the tool by which she opens the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	The form of this (presumably referring to a medical procedure or tool) arrives for those that come after them.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you wish to use this tool, you press against the deep part of the womb's woman: so that what comes out from the tool does not exceed the depth of the womb and harms the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If however the tool is larger than the depth, then you should place small stones on the cover of the deep part of the womb: so that the entry of the whole tool into the deep part of the womb is prohibited. It is necessary to place a whirlwind which runs in the tool from the top side and to hold the tool while rotating this whirlwind until the depth of the womb opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When then, the incision appears and is touched by hand and feels soft and fleshy, it then becomes necessary to remove that incision at his head with a broad scalpel.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the incision is healed properly, then it becomes necessary to place a submerged lump in an oil bath of rose oil: or olive oil, where there is some medicinal quality: and insert the lump, and extract the section deeply into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the matrix, and over clean woolen cloth submerged in water, into which the walnuts have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then cleanse with an appropriate ointment for this purpose after two days, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and the wound are washed so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then afterwards with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has been boiled. Then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden within the matrix internally, then it becomes necessary to refrain from treating it with iron or rather treat it together with what we have mentioned about division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they treat living embryos according to the figure that is not natural.
Caput Lxxu.	Head 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural figure of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Thus, the signs are as follows: when you see a woman pressing herself downwards, and desiring to smell the air, and finds comfort with what is over her about childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you will know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and it is his exit upon his own head, and alongside him: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary that the abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it lowers its head, it also lowers the cord with it, and is purified from those excesses by a good process of purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	And anyone other than this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one hand of it, or one foot of it; or its head and one hand come out; or only the abdomen emerges: and perhaps turns over its neck, and similar disgraceful figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the intellect operates in that area, and this is illustrated by it being placed above him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges above its head in its natural ejection, and somewhat lies on the woman, making childbirth difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her up. And let her breathe fumes of steam with cooked thyme, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert the Spatumile (a tool) between her fingers, and guide it along with the cord, and cleanse it with her finger until all that is inside comes out from the humidity: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then the woman should be irrigated with a mixture of thyme mucus and safflower oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her after irrigating, to be compressed: and have her sneeze with the herbs, and hold her mouth and nose all at once.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus would emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you should then reduce them with ease and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not comply at the entrance, then put a woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held so she doesn't fall during the冲击.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them and remove the rest of the fetus: and tie its hand with cloth and pull it out evenly; for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it should push them upwards: then convert the fetus gradually: afterwards balance it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge until the hips, then instruct her to squeeze and have her sneeze when she is ready: it will come out if God wishes.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have described, then reduce the fetus gradually until you place it according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	Then it will emerge then with ease.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is opposed with all that we have described: then take from the aqueous mucus and safflower oil, and dissolved gum: and crush it in good mortar crushing; then give her to cry out while she is above her stomach, and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until the womb descends.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts have warmed up, then make her drink a myrrh decoction: and place him on her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she holds the sieve for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose: and apply pressure to the lower part of the stomach with ease.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The fire will immediately emerge.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The baby will exit over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits according to this shape, then place his hands inside gradually during the insertion.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is turned over on her neck, and her feet hang downwards: and she herself lies on the bed, and joins her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then apply pressure gradually to his abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under his feet from the uterine cavity, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	But if the baby doesn't exit, then take his feet, and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then apply pressure to what is above the womb gradually until the baby ascends to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert his hands and gradually adjust the position of the baby: and instruct the woman to compress herself until the baby exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The baby will exit hanging longitudinally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	His hands will be placed inside during the maneuver.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if she cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed and shake her legs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the preparation you made from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If it receives that birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then practice in reducing the hand, and equally free the fetus according to its natural form. And make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to compress herself until the birth is complete.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its own neck, with its hands spread out, and its face is towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and equally ease it with facilitation.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When then he is equalized, then place on the oil and mucus mixture which we described over its buttocks.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress herself: and make her sneeze when she is positioned.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus, prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends through the mother's opening according to this method with a thread, then split the thread with your nail until it is cleared by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its neck, then strike her from the navel: so that she does not be held back and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the insides until you place her as it should be: and instruct the woman to compress herself occasionally: for he will come out with a gentle birth.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are born frequently: and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is foreign and it rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	But there are five things outside nature, and they do not live completely: and it contains them even though they multiply, a single second part; and they separate through the siphon, distinguishing those bound in each of their abdomens.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one does when the fetus comes out through a natural opening, easily. And they come out through an unimaginable opening, as we have told you.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	And if some of them prove difficult during delivery and resort to what we said about unnatural figures, then care for them as we have instructed: and let there be a subtle incision, and do what needs to be done with ease and deliberation, and adapt it according to every figure using whatever is being prepared for him by an ingenious mind aimed at healing.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which forms in the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes, in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed: and it has been confirmed to me that a woman who miscarries emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	This was done through the measurement of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this should be fully understood in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to something similar; so compare it with what is required.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	¶ On the extraction of dead fetuses.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus along with what I said about dividing through medication, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use the procedure with your hands, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and not in any of those accidents by which her loss is feared, then it should be that the woman lies on the bed on her back, and her head is bent downwards, and her legs are raised: and the attendants should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body does not come out at the time of the delivery of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb's mouth with oils that are moist and mixed with slippery elm, and fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should moisten her hand with these oils and mucus, then insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek out where within the fetus the claws (uncinas) are located, and find the appropriate places for them.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	So consider this: if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the claws (uncinas) on its eyes, or around its neck, or into its mouth, or onto the palate of itself, or under its beard, or in its throat, or in close locations near the ribs, and beneath the pubis.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If the descent is upon its feet, then it should be on his metatarsus and midribs of his side.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it should hold the claw with his right hand and give curvature to that which is between the left hand's fingers. And insert it with ease using his hand, fixing the claw in one of those locations we have mentioned until he reaches an empty place.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another claw opposite to the first one, or a third if needed, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean towards any side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then stretch it with an equal stretching, and do not make the extension only according to a straight line, but move it towards every part so that the ease of its escape is facilitated: just as it happens when pulling out a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it should be such that what is between this allows for softening of extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should anoint certain fingers with oil and insert them from that side in order to manipulate what is being retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore, part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another position which is higher. Do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand emerges before another part and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constraint; then it is necessary that a cloth be manipulated over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until when it has emerged completely, strike it either at the joint of the sole or in the wrist; and one must do this with the other hand, and on both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the fetus' head is large, or if it is constrained during delivery, or there is water accumulated in its head; then one must insert between his fingers the sharp spatula, and guide it with him to find and extract the head, and remove the water. Or he may break it with the tool that is called Almisdac: which has a shape similar to the other tools, in the chapter that comes after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly if the fetus has a nature of large head, then one should take off the algengamatu (perhaps referring to a type of tool): or extract it with the misda (another surgical instrument), as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	And if the head emerges and gets constrained at the sternum: then guide it until moisture which is in the chest spills out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not get tangled and does not yield to delivery: then strike the head quickly according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If it is below the belly where pus has formed, or there is hydrocele within it: then one must puncture it until moisture drains out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above its own feet, then its pull is easy and its direction towards the birth canal is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted at the belly or chest area, then you must remove him with the cloth that you had wrapped around your hand. And expand the belly or chest until what is within them has drained out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If in turn, the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the birth canal is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the birth canal, and search for it with her hand, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the birth canal: then she should insert one hook or two hooks into it, and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the birth canal is constricted due to hot pus that occurs to it, then one should not exert effort upon it directly. Rather, it is necessary to administer an effusion of wet substances and oily ones at that time. And apply a poultice. And sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its own side, then it might be possible to balance it: then give what we said about balancing a live fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible for that, then one should proceed roughly and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it must be that you do not let anything from the afterbirth leave completely inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your task, then administer what we said about the hot blisters that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If bleeding occurs, then proceed with a bath of styptic waters, and apply the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed, I have already seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus. Afterwards, she was pregnant with another one, but then even that fetus died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long period of time, an abscess occurs at her navel, and it swells until it opens; and she began to expel pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore summoned for her treatment, and I treated her over a long period of time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed on it with some strong plasters of attraction: and an opening emerged from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then, after passing some days for her, another opening emerged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised, because there is no mouth inside the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I thought that it might be because of the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I investigated the wound, and I extracted many bones from it while she was in better positions for herself. And she has been living like this for a long time now, expelling only slightly some pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not attach this foreign object here, unless it is because of the knowledge and assistance that it provides for what the physician-craftsman, using his skill with his hands, administers during treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	### About the Shapes of Necessary Tools in the Extraction of the Fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below is the form of the Tourniquet, with which the books are adjusted, having two ridges equally on both ends of the two sticks.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, for vertigo, this needs to be more refined with a stricture: and in order for it to be done, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be as if it were two fingers: and the edge of each pair is as one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two reinforcements made from the same type of wood which have been firmly attached to both; their length is half a palm plus or minus: and the width of each is like two fingers, either more or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And those two reinforcements are inserted into the maternal mouth, so that it opens when you rotate them with your two vertiges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of a vertigo by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to that one but more refined and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of scissors.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity there should be two reinforcements as you see above: and the length of all the reinforcements from them is as if it were a palm. And the width of each of them is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you wish to open the matrix with it, then let the woman sit on the bed with her legs hanging down, and have that which is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert those two reinforcements together into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the tool between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the tool as you would with tongs, evenly according to how much force you wish from the opening of the matrix, until the midwife wishes what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of the whirlpool, as the ancients described it, is the form of that which propels, by which the fetus is propelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which the large head is reduced: and it is likened to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is oblong, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is struck and reduced.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is reduced.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of someone holding one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of someone holding two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps that have saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is reduced.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilii, even those that are larger.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used in action. And the more they multiply and their species get refined by artisans, it makes the execution of their task faster for them, and they gain higher esteem among people due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	So you should not disdain any of these instruments that might be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	The need for them is undeniable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the extraction of the Secondina.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78: Head
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secondina is retained during labor, then you must use a weak one to retain its suckling.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze while you're blowing on her: and hold your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a cauldron and pierce the cover with a hole. And put into it opening herbs for the womb, like the reed, the date fruit, and the flax, and chamomile, and cumin, and cinnamon wood, and centaurium. Take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them in water, then place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bundle of reed over the hole on the cauldron cover and put the other end into the opening of the womb. Keep it until steam reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Therefore, it will emerge with ease the second time.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in safflower oil or in the juice of alaea.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then introduce it into the uterus, and let her take out the Secondina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then take it and gradually extend it little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert the hand as we have described until she finds the Secondina and extracts it gradually according to its straightness, so that it does not fall out of the womb due to a strong pull. Indeed, it must be extracted with ease alternating between the right and left sides, and then added in accordance with the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	She will then obey, take care, and be adjusted from sticking.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	And if the womb's opening is constricted, as we have already described: take care of her with sneezing and from the treatment using herbs from the cauldron.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware not to tire on it in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	However, you must bind what emerges to the woman's hipbone as it exits from the maternal canal.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then, treat her with a suppository using the tetrapharmaceutical ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For after one or two days, it will corrupt her and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it corrupts, a bad smell rises to the stomach and head, and this afflicts the weakened one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the old experts have already tried using fumigation with watercress and dried rue.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the tool used for fumigation by women at retention after Childbirth and during menstruation is described.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it like a large calamus or from wood; and place the broad end over the flame: and have the fumigation placed above the plums: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	¶ On the care of unperforated ears.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born and their ears have not been pierced, which he has already treated with delicate cautery.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must pierce that with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp tool: and beware of burns, do not let them touch.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool that has been soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it will heal inwardly, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and it is removed when the child wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now, healing occurs in Anus as well, either due to the strengthening of wounds or apoplexy.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, that consolidation should be cut, and then it should be treated with what we said previously about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	¶ On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Title 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower region are: Nodation and Enlargement near the anus of the defecation orifice: or within a space of one part: and there is one fistula, or multiple ones.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	And when that nodulation heals, it is opened, and moisture or thin pus runs out from there.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas have penetrating ones.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what emerges during defecation and wind when the patient is expelling food. And perhaps worms emerge from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And these fistulas occur when they penetrate into the blister and up to the muscle of the sword.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are penetrating ones that go up to the junction of the thigh and up to the tail node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this, it can be recognized that a fistula penetrating up to the anus is distinguishable even from one that does not penetrate. This is done by inserting your finger into the anus and then introducing a delicate probe into the fistula through air or metal: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is curvature within it, then insert into her a delicate lead wire or a pin from the horsehair, until you feel the wire or pin in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely inside, and no discharge is produced from the hole, nor any windiness, nor a worm as I said: then you will know that it's non-penetrating. Therefore proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to a blister or to the bladder of urine: then its meaning is the discharge of urine from there, and prevention of it by this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating up to the junction of the thigh, or up to its opening: then its indication is that a probe will reach there if there's no curvature up to the opening; and finding pain around the part, and pus constantly coming out from it, and medicine not being effective, nor consolidating with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment for them is labor and futility, to be formed by foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In those though that are not penetrating, and not old, there is expected healing with the application of serro. According to what I am telling you, and which I have already proven: and it happens that they lie weak between your hands on their back, and raise their legs up to above their hips, and their thighs incline towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert the lead rod or air into the fistula until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If the sick person feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel that the needle has penetrated through itself which you have detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and it, or flesh: then you will certainly know that it is penetrating. Do not then trouble about her (referring to a patient), because there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, it was said that the flesh is healed in certain individuals, and by means of medication through which one hopes for improvement, is as follows: use a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, just like before, insert the burning part into the fistula until it reaches close to the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the added flesh, which is similar to bird's feathers, has become sufficiently cooked.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with the enclosed wax until those cooked flesh parts emerge: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the needle comes out and does not go all the way to your finger which is at the anus, or there's a thick skin of flesh between it and the needle, then you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin. Then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and when you follow cutting with the needle within the fistula until the cut reaches where the needle tip arrives, then free the needle and it falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those flesh parts that resemble bird's feather tubes, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood overcomes you and separates between you and your work, then it is better to quickly aid with either cauterizing that with fire or using an acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because when cautery is combined with fire, it adds the heating of these flesh parts, and the removal of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care about this with the clothes soaked in butter or ground dough until the place releases pus and those flesh parts that are heated in pus come out.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care at this point with gauzes soaked in hardening ointments that generate tough flesh: and are medicines where there is coagulation and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it heals, then it is healed already: and you do not know any repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached down to the depth of the anus and extends due to excess of body: then insert your finger into the anus and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel it touched, and there is a film or flesh between you and her, and she is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that place, unless according to the way of hope and expectation.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which means that one of the three methods is applied to it: or you cauterize her, as we said; or you remove her until you find the concavity of her, so that you can be able to insert a forceps, and heal with something nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cut, so as not to enter a canal containing the anus, and happen upon unintended discharge of waste without desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care about this with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or you might lengthen the film itself and cleanse it after cutting it close to the anus, as we said, or when touched, or with another sharp tool of a different kind.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those meats that are filtered and are in the section until you can clean with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of all with the whole section and at the upper opening where it gets established: and there will remain an Fissure open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter for the sick person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the Fissure is sewn according to this manner: and it is when you introduce the probe into the Fissure: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take the probe at the perforated extremity, which is like a needle head, that is, prepared strips, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wound from five threads, and roughly that area.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the probe with the thread into the Fissure until you reach its curvature.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it penetrates into the edge of the anus internally near to that place, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so as you can insert your finger into the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and unite both ends at once: and tighten both, and let them off for one or two days: and the longer the thread penetrates in the flesh, the better tighten it until those meats are between the two ends of the thread and fall off: then care for the wound until it gets established and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	And if the Fissure's opening is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way that has been prepared for you, unless it be deeply.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you should not do this because of the wound, so as not to hit it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then proceed with that as we said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the spine-shaped spatulum used to make a fistula; whose edge is sharply acute on one part and the other part is not so acute in order that it might not touch what is unnecessary as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision: and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Title 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two ways of having hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or indeed, they occur inside the anus, resembling bladders of charcoal, or of almonds: or as if they were grains of sand.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And there are paired ones, and large ones: blood flows from them always, it may be one, or many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they occur outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus have very little moisture; from them water of a yellowish color flows out, or there is a somewhat continuous flow of blood; they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for those inside the anus is to advise the sick person to wash with it: and squeeze until the anus comes out and you see the whitish substance to your eye.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hang them with hooks therefore: or hold them with your finger nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not stay in them with the hooks because of their and their own softness: then seize them with a rough cloth or with a thong made from doubled thread, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and apply some warm powders over the cuts after the operation, so that they serve as a substitute for cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	They should be cauterized according to what was prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then attend to them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not respond to expulsion, then treat the patient with a mild enema containing a small amount of anodyne. This will allow what is inside the anus to be expelled quickly when the patient pushes during bowel movement.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If the athletes are expelled from outside the anus, then their condition is light and easy; it is possible that you can catch them with your finger or with a hook, and insert them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then attend to them in the manner we have described until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for those who abstain from iron cutting operation, then it is necessary to apply their stitches according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the thread that has been wound up, and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the athlete out upwards and make it pierce with its point at the root from another side: and wind the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, making them transversely: and tighten the stitch of the athlete firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie knots in the thread, and pull out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Perform this with all the athletes and release one from them: do not leave him as he is to prevent excess bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or plaster, and put it on top of the anus. And instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then release him until he falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the athletes then fall off, attend to them with the use of ointment and other treatments until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the Care of Wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed, many times it happens from the drying out of feces, and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	And when they become dry and medicine no longer benefits them: then it is necessary to use threads with a Spatumilis point or with your nail until they become moist and the upper layer of skin that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate though: then repeat them with a more severe reason than the first until they bleed much and are scraped afterward, care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of Almirmar inverted wounds, and non-inverted ones, and Athelil dryings, and those caused by ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing else but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the entire body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain occurs from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it must be cut where there is the circumference of a nail, and held with tweezers or with a hook, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if necessary, cauterize it according to what preceded it in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From Athelil dryings, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the body's surface.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often happens on children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	The treatment for this is to stretch the Athelil and pierce it: or to tie it with a silk thread: or with hair until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you have to treat a urinary disorder, cauterize it according to what has been previously stated with fire or with sharp medicine: and now inverted meconiums are eradicated both those that are inverted and those that are not, using the tool that I am about to say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	The ant is also a small eminent thing filtered and fat, located on the surface of the body, piercing deeply inside. And when it finds coldness, it feels like an ants bite in that area, and this happens throughout the body. A great deal of it forms in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The treatment for this is to take a tube from a goose feather or from the feathers of strong birds. Place that tube over the ant until it fills the circle made by parts of its body.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube until you have removed what is within the circle around the ant. Place it deeply into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with an air or iron tube according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the tube of the cannula above its lowest part, drawing out a dull roll so that it can be easily removed from the finger and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization of Athelil.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	§ On the forms of instruments used for enemas in digestive illnesses, and bowel adjustments, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Title LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from bronze, or from blown or hammered air.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made with these small and large instruments according to how they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered for the care of small children, let it be small, and as to those whose ages are weak or painful, thus also rectal washes for them.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its cannula, that is the upper part where it is tied to the uterus, should be broad according to this measure: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is tied as you see it being tied, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be closed, that is not open, soft, very much, pulling towards thinness: and on one of its sides there should be two apertures, and on the other side of the side there should be one aperture.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the size of the aperture be according to the thickness of the radii, and slightly thicker, and let the uterus in which medicines are placed from the animal bladder: or from parchment ear, which should have a form like that of half an egg: whose root is one hand.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced through many apertures as it is twisted, and there should be a space which is the thickness of a finger between each aperture.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a strong thread made from raw wool into these apertures, which should be made from ten threads or roughly that number, and tie it with the uterus like an egg.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When then the uterus is placed inside, it should be tightened at the head with a strong constriction between two distinguishing contractions for the clister.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then perform the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle depicted here and the apertures.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the enema to be used with it is as follows: fill either the uterus or the bladder from medicine, which should be heated according to the amount that the sick can tolerate. And beware not to make it excessively hot or excessively cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is made to lie on his back and raise his legs to the higher position. And place beneath him a skin or piece of cloth where people are lying down.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then immerse the extremity in a mixture of Clister oil or with tallow, or with snot of eel, or with fennel mucus, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then receive the attendant slave with both his hands simultaneously, and express him until he evacuates completely what is inside the Clisteri in the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the Clister, and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine considers him fit for release, then hold him as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps through that entire night, it is more beneficial towards recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you give him Clister in the discomforts of the body's solution and hastens his release: then repeatedly use Clister until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or wounds in the anus, then use Clister very subtly and gently, using those Clisters that are used to prepare for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this form of subtle Clister should be placed on what is tightly skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	### Care for Wounds of the Head without Fracture of Bone
Caput LXXXIIII.	Title: 84th Chapter
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken about the division of treating wounds in the book and here I will explain their treatment both with hands and medicines as per the remainder.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then that wounds are distinguished according to how they are made and according to where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, as for which wounds are made repeatedly, they are like the impact of a stone: or cut by a sword, or by a knife: or struck with a spear, or with wood, or an arrow: and similarly through many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds which occur according to the location of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or buttocks, and similarly through other parts of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am recounting treatments for certain wounds, so as to establish this reasoning and guide in the treatment of other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the composition of remedies will be recalled at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of bone: then consider if it was due to the impact of a stone or something similar, and has only scratched the skin; and it's a large wound and you fear for an ill outcome with bleeding from hot plants. Then apply, and immediately perform bloodletting to the head: and do not delay this action: and remove from his blood according to its effectiveness quantity: if nothing prohibits bloodletting, especially if the blood that flows out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of overindulgence, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	And if there is something that prohibits the reduction, then it should be reduced by diet alone, and not approach meats or wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place a hot poultice on the wound if it happens to him, soaked in undiluted rose oil or wine with some restorative properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are assured by the hot bleedings, then place upon the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not changed into air, a little of the powder I will tell you afterwards: and if it has already changed into air, then place upon it some unguents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large or comes from a cut with a blade and is similar to others: and its edges do not adhere together by poultices, then you should join them with stitches, according to what I will tell you about wounds in the abdomen regarding their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been detected from bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension band: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Next, care for the wound with medicines, and restore bone tissue instead of skin. Instruct the patient to eat food that is rich in nourishment, such as heads (of cattle) and cooked wheat, until they feel fullness, and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find decomposition in the skin and it does not adhere to bone: then cut out the decomposed part completely and remove it. Then take care of that area.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows and cannot be removed by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find that it is not followed, then cut and bind it with the help of woolen thread, or ligate it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity prompts you when it doesn't allow for what we said, then apply cautery until blood is discharged.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so apply this powder over them because it hardens them before they change into air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method for Cutting on an Incarnate Wound.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of the unextinguished ashes: it should be thoroughly ground together, and sifted through a sieve: and it is to be filled into the wound, and bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to the inside and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind him from above with powders, and release him, do not break him while he remains there, so that he does not slip away.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does this with a plaster alone, when olibanum and dragon's blood are not available to you. And they perform the same operation in many large wounds when it is necessary to put it over them and bind them tightly, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood which has not been disturbed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	And if that blood has been disturbed by some change, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this powder's purpose is not in position: therefore take care with what we said earlier, so you apply over them some prepared ointment: or place over them plasters made from wheat flour mixed with water and honey until pus is released.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	And if a fracture occurs with the wound in bone, and it is small, then extract that with Gastrum: and I will already have spoken of the treatment for skull fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The Treatment for Wounds on the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85: The Head
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the cervical nerve or artery has already been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no instrument for its treatment other than with due attention to its care along with severe compression, like zinnia and ziggy, and those similar.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold absolutely over the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold and their continuance is with the brain which is superior to the members; and let this be treated with medicine in a mild way, like calx mixed with sweet water occasionally infused with oil or with rose oil, and turmeric when it is washed even with sweet water: and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply sutures: or constrict its edges with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the depth of the wound is great, or if a sinus occurs in its lower part where pus has already accumulated, then pierce it at a more depressed place in that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	And if an artery has already been cut in the wound and a flow of blood follows, then separate it or dry it out and ligate it; or cauterize it if necessity calls for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	And if the pharynx or all of it has been cut and the alar muscles have been injured, then gather together the edges of the skin with sutures over the thread of the throat, and do not touch the throat but rather smooth it out and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	And then tighten the incision with an appropriate bandage, and release it after some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care about the application of ointments with cautery and desiccation until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If a wound has already made an impression in the bone, then examine it. If there are fragments of bone within it, extract them all or as many as you can from them: and when something is not yet ready for removal, leave that alone until the wound rots away, and its exit is separated and cleaned out.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it seems that there is an opening into the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it along with what comes to mind from its description, which you will find in the corresponding chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	¶ On the Wound in spatulas (a medical tool).
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is the impact of a spear or a knife, and you perceive its depth, then consider it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore, from the wound, there comes out a whistling sound when the sick person pants from it, then you will know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep and there is only recent bleeding from his own blood: then do not put any powder on it for the first hour, nor squeeze it, lest he retain the blood at its depth and it returns to the heart and kills him. Instead, apply an attractive ointment to it, and wash it off twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if indeed an ointment is not available to you, then put a used wick into the wound's hole so that it draws out what comes out of it from moisture. And have him sleep over the wound, so that what accumulates within it may heal.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If three days or more have already passed since the wound and no illness has occurred, nor any adverse heartbeat trembling, nor constriction during breathing, and you see all other his conditions are good: then you will know that the wound is healing.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat him with care and according to regulations, and all other treatments, until he heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the wound is healing properly and constantly opens, then you will know that already a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat that [fistula] according to its chapter (or section).
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut by a scalpel or sword and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat that [wound] along with what came before from stitching, if there is much: or with dust, if there is little.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	And if it has already made an imprint in the bone and things are falling out from there: then examine the wound, and properly proceed to extract those pieces, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound begins to rot, for their extraction would indeed cause harm.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment for the rest of wound accidents on other limbs is in the treatment, as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	§ On Wounds of the Belly, and Egress of Intestines, and Their Discharge.
Caput LXXXVII.	Title 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that happens to the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great ones, sometimes there egresses intestines, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, an insertion of them and their stitching is more severe and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small division becomes difficult from another method.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that reducing them becomes more difficult, if you do not promptly insert them into their place upon application: since they expand, open, and thicken; hence their entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, it follows that the better division is achieved using a medium method: because when this does not cause difficulty in reducing the intestine, as occurs in these two categories.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that the suturing of veins is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are compatible for suture of the abdomen, and for suture of other body wounds; and two other specific sutures are properly applied to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more appropriate for the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with explanation and description.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes through it, making its reduction difficult; then this corresponds to one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or due to the difficulty in division as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	So when this is the case, then you must warm it up so that you immerse a sponge or wet cloth alone in lukewarm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with ginger, reed, and herbs, and mix it with the intestine until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it does this in one where there is stiffness; and it's better than just water for resolving the inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	So when you see that the inflammation has already resolved, then soak the intestine with water that has been boiled with it, or with malt.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For that reason, it is diminished the entry of him with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	And if the return is relieved after this treatment, then in the case of anemia, find a little bit with the tool used to cut the hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first treatment is better when it is prepared than the cut: and there is no forced action to cut again after need and lack of equipment.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let there be a part of it which is twisted and pointed, and another part which is not pointed, and the tip shall not be fine like Spatumilis, indeed it should be more obtuse slightly: and that is what resembles a spur, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	And when the ulcer then enters the intestines, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible over that: because this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the disruption is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the sick lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head and its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always on this, so that the part where the ulcer is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it must be that you administer this in large ulcers and in medium-sized ulcers.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In very small ulcers, place that according to what has been prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a worthy minister present between your hands who will hold the entire disruption with his hand and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then take from her who follows the stitch something after something, and this is the common method of stitching for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is like taking the point, or the number of points according to the size of the wounds.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then remove from the edge of the rupture a length equal to that of an annular finger, which is the size that doctors use. And hold one point of your needle over where you are going to introduce the thread into the skin at both ends; when you have done this with both ends and prepared what lies under the skin on the inside, do so until it penetrates from another part. At this point you will have joined together two ends of skin, and two ends of the other material: and there are four layers formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a doubled thread around the tip of your needle several times from both parts at once, until you have joined together two parts of the wound in a manner fitting to them.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of an annular finger, and hold another point of your needle in them: afterwards guide this with the thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not stop doing that with it from which you need, until you complete the constriction around all of the wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needle be of medium size between thickness and fineness: for needles that are very fine pierce the flesh quickly; and those that are thick are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it should have a medium size both in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not happen that the needle becomes entangled in two nearby skin ends greatly: so as not to pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its healing, and also not to extend during the stitching, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then penetrate the end of the needle so as not to injure the patient during their sleep: and place small cushions made from cloths on all sides for the ends of the needles: and release them until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed, this kind of stitch with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is sufficient for the stitches of them to use one needle, or two, or around those.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of stitch is common, as it joins together with the stitches at each end: the ends, two layers of skin, and the ends are placed in a vice-like grip together with one needle, in which there is a thread rolled inside equal in thickness and size.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the four ends of these needles from where you began, move the needle back to that part so that the thread wound on from the upper part of the wound falls: like sewing a piece of cloth together they would be sewn, and place between every stitch the thickness equivalent to a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I myself sutured his wound that had occurred within his abdomen, which had been cut by a knife and there was a rupture of the wounds greater than one palm: and it protruded from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I returned that back after it stood out twenty-four hours outside his wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was thus consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I attended to him, he recovered, and he lived many years after that, changed in his ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was by miracle rather than through my treatment with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from the doctors.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore applied a fresh poultice of honey three times a day to the affected bone, and washed it regularly with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two types of suture that are appropriate according to the narrative of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And here is how you start with a sharp suture: and you will insert the tip from the outer part to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	And when the needle has penetrated through the skin and into the wound, making its way according to the length and width of the entire body: cut off the end of it, then direct one side of this end onto where you have inserted the needle, and make that other end penetrate from the inner part to the outer part at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	And when you have made it penetrate as described at this end of the same side towards the outer part to the inner: then cut off the other end from here which is on this side and make the needle penetrate into another end from the inner part to the outer at the opposite end. And make it penetrate with the direction in which you are making it penetrate in this latter end which is a part of it, until it penetrates fully into it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin from this side as well, and pull the thread that comes out from where it penetrated through the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin, and with the end of this thread which is on the other side take hold of its counterpart: and pull this from the skin which is on his part. And do the opposite too, taking alternately one way then another, until you have pulled out all around in accordance with that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suturing method is like that used in suturing skin where there are layers: such that you take the thread alternately from one end of each layer of skin and pull it out alternately from another end. Continue until you complete the process.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second type of proper suture, as Galenus named it.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech tells about his manner of recounting it, such that he joins every part with another compatible one according to its nature when speaking of these certain ones amongst physicians. And they apply the end of one to the other's end and the inner end to the inner end of the other.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must fix the point of the needle near the inner part from the outer side to the proximal end of mirach, and make it penetrate only to the inner surface within that. And you release both ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner one through both ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them, and also make each one penetrate from the inner part to the outer one up to the other ends of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	This method of stitching is a better common suture than the usual one and it's the suture that precedes its recall.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This, therefore, is the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The rectification of the abdominal suture is done with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which means you introduce both threads into each of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is at your side, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to their suture method which are equal in strength.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you will know that when a disruption occurs in the middle of the abdomen: then its suture is harder than those of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgement of treatment for wounds is the judgement of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	What is this, that when you take up a recent wound with its blood, before it dries and hardens, and return the intestine to its place, and fit all things together properly: then put on top of the powder of cooked flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound: then put something on top of it that are your present remedies, until pus forms; and let the threads fall out, and let them heal well, and marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would do with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however the remedies are not present for you, then immediately put something on top of it as soon as pus begins to come out, old wadding: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other remedies when wounds are simple in various dispositions.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the main limbs in injury, then it is necessary for you to immerse fine wadding into oil of tempered warmth, or into rose oil: and place that within the surrounding areas which are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If there is pain, or punctures, or putrefaction within the intestines (for this happens many times), then cleanse it with a wine enema, stiptic, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already entered into the intestine and caused a passage through its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal and that which comes from them from the thin one is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the肠 called the Jejunum does not receive healing from the wound that happens in it entirely: and this is because of its abundance, which comes from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity itself of the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	However, if that which proceeds from the wound is hair, and you have obtained it fresh: follow it according to your reduction method, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the time has passed and it is already green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that became darker from it, in order that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	Indeed, in hair there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut the ligament that comes after this one, and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it. So that when you pull on it, there will be a pull above you, and an extraction at the time of hair, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember that which happens to wounds that occur in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some individuals to heal. Therefore, as I witnessed someone who was injured in his abdomen with a lance strike, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was formed, and the expulsion of food and gas occurred from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment, until I was not satisfied with its healing. I did not stop refining it until it had healed and the site had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I observed the site had consolidated, I feared for the frail, lest something harmful happen to him inside his abdomen: and indeed, no harm befell him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better arranged conditions, eating and drinking, and defecating, and entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and there is little: then it must be tied according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And you will receive as many ants as the heads of great ones.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Next, place two lips over the wound and put one ant from those that have an open mouth on top of the two lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And when it reaches over them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head; for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with an ant after an ant according to the quantity of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then restore it, and let its wound heal.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For the heads remain attached inside the intestine until it eats its food and heals, and no harm will occur entirely to a weak person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a thin thread: which is extracted from an animal's intestine and attached to it after being introduced into the tip.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you will receive this thread's end from the intestine, and much flesh will be removed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the thin, rolled linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the tip, and let it heal with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then restore it to its disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and the intestine is nothing else than according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know which is the large one, broad, especially if it's in one of the thin intestines: then there isn't a skill except for refinement, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding the care of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Title LVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound, or pustule when it hardens and becomes old, and turns into a ulcer, and does not heal up, and constantly exudes pus, and is never resolved: then it is called universally wherever it may be in any member, and we call it a Fistula. And we name it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed, a Fistula according to truth is a drained lump, tough, white; it has no pain and has the shape of a bird's feather. Because of this, some people call it 'Risati', that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes they become moist, which emit pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And this moisture can be abundant, and scarce: it can be thick, or thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already explained this in the division where I said that every ulcer that does not heal is not born within the flesh, and it is due to only one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Which is due to one of nine causes. These are: either because there is scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its wickedness; or because flesh is hard between it and above its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filthiness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and what is sent to it has bad quality; or because medicine is inconvenient for treating it; or because decay is falling in that region which makes pestilence, like in Caesarea Augusta, where digestion of ailments becomes difficult and healing of pustules is delayed through nature: or because there is one opening, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments thereof with medicines, in division; it is necessary here that you should know the treatment of Fistula and Zuckem which occurs through a way of operation using hands.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you should know that Fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	Therefore, there are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinuses: or to the intestines, or bladder, or some of the ribs: or some of the lumbar regions, or to a combination of joints in their formation: such as hands, and feet. And among them are those that flow towards the vicinity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	So among these Fistulas, according to this manner, is one resulting from illnesses that are difficult to cure, and do not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is hard work and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach the places I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its treatment, and desire to attain knowledge about it, then take a trial by air, or iron, if the Fistula extends according to rectitude, and inquire after it together with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a twisting in the Fistula, then investigate it together with testing by a subtle lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, when combined with its own body, will be repelled and curved around the twisting (of the Fistula).
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to describe it with lead.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate from them, the opening through their openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture by which you irrigate it, directs the flow of other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to the manner that is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is an opening or a nerve there, and whether it is a hollow of a fistula far away or near by. Or whether there is one fistula with many openings, and stands over all this, using your utmost strength: with your questioning which you use to ask the patient, and in the detection of pain upon compression at the site by your hand, and through similar symptoms and causes of events.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	And when you stand upon that true station, then proceed to treatment according to your confidence: and it is that you should consider this at that moment if there appears a fistula nearby, or in a place save long distant from the junction, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or any of those places which I told you about: then cut the fistula as was instructed from my account, and remove what is inside it by filtration, and corruption in flesh, that which is born in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for that until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is deep and extends straight: then it must be cut deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse that from all rotten flesh of its.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer licorice which is wrapped in medicines for acute conditions: and insert it up to the hollow of the fistula that you comprehended with iron: do this with it as many times, until the medicine for acute conditions has corroded completely what remained in the hollow of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal through this, then burn it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If thus the cause of Fistula is the anus and you confirm this: then inquire about it and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from cutting anywhere in the vein, nerve or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If indeed it is discovered to you that there is an opening, and within it there is some corruption, and darkness: then shave it until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what makes it flesh grow again, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	And if it does not heal and discharges pus as before: then you will know that you have not achieved complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, detect it again above that one, and carefully consider its nature, and the purification of it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, then you will know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, there is no talent for you in it, except to dismiss nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	And if the defected one is small and you can do it, draw it with fine forceps that suit this.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	And if there are many bones, then carefully make the extraction of them all, and do not let you release anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	And if something from the humidity opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in their cuttings: then cut out those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	And if indeed you do not have the preparation to remove bones at your time, then place over the wound that will rot it: and remove it until what is rotten from around those bones within flesh and humors has degraded.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten (secure) the section you cut during your surgery.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place upon it, if you fear, the sulfur-caked portion immersed in ground and cooked oil: or the sulfur-caked portion immersed in an Egyptian ointment, or any of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these wettings decompose and the bones separate from them, then the removal of those is favored, and their attraction occurs.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is a large single mouth like the thigh bone or the acetabulum, and similar ones, and what has rotted from it is a large part: then shave it until the last reason, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then heal the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is in it has rotted and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw through it, and to cut it entirely until the place where the corruption reaches. Then take care of it until it heals and hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, this happens to the thigh bone: use it as an example and assistance for your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man around thirty years old, who experienced pain in his thigh bone due to an event that caused movement on him inside his body, which is from the internal parts, until the materials reached the knee, and there was a large hematoma: and it wasn't because of any external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So the period was extended with medical errors until the abscess is opened and many materials have gathered together.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the treatment until a sinus is formed at the knee and many openings are made within it; all of these were emitting pus and body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	He therefore subjected himself to the care of a multitude of doctors for about two years, and was not skillful in the art until I was called upon him and saw his legs, and the materials flowing out of those openings at a great rate: moreover, his entire male body had become discolored, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I then introduced the probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the mouth of it.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I thoroughly examined all the openings: and I found them to be communicating with each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I proceeded then, and followed through one of those openings until I found a part of the bone: and I discovered him to be corrupted: which was already corroded, and deteriorated, and rotten, and perforated, until it penetrated down to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore incised what was found by me, and prepared from the decayed bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I treated it, which was not in the bone except that corruption, which I incised and opened.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then, I laid the restoration in with healing ointments for a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it has not been consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried it again, and found a second opening above the first detection: and I discovered continuous corruption with the bone: and I opened what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it has not been restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore detected it again upon him, and I did not cease to enter his mouth in detail, and try to restore it: and until I entered the bone about one手掌's width, and extracted that together with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then restore him with medicines, and he is quickly strengthened and healed. There was no need for this repetition of the operation and cutting on him, except due to the debilitation of the sick person, his low tolerance, and my fear for his death: because all sorts of bad things befall him continuously from excessive discharge through paroxysms.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	So he is fully healed: and a hard, durable flesh grows in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement has been made within his body, and his strength returns: and he adapts to his circumstances: and it did him no harm at all during walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	And if there is an elevated opening in the body already broken: then it must be sewn, according to this manner: and thus: take the tendon, and tighten it at the end of the projecting bone: and instruct someone to extend it upwards: and put another thicker piece of linen cord over the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then join it over the flesh which is at the bone: and extend its end so that you take flesh downwards: and give flesh above the place where you want to sew, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a slab under the bone lower down in the middle: because when you do this, it does not prevent that the flesh of the decayed part will be cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it must be that the saw is over the decayed place somewhat evenly, so there will not be a concavity of the bone in the decayed part: and it should not appear in its appearance to the sense, nor provoke him through his own sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is decayed and there is no elevated part, rather continue with its portion together. And decay is in the middle of it or in a part of it, then take flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a piece of wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first part where decay exists, until the sawing continues on the other side: and let the sawing be according to the length of the decay somewhat closely, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If decay is found at the joint, cut the joint that is decaying and saw on the part where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed decay is found at the continuation of two joints, then it is not an ingenuity except for wear and tear.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If decay is found in the hand cuff or in the foot cuff: then it is very difficult to address within.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, you must inquire about the decay as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And wear it down, and cleanse it according to whatever possible arrangement you can, and correct it with whatever skill is agreeable to you when there is no contradiction with a vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that many files and saws are used for this kind of cutting on bones according to the positioning of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their smoothness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the appropriate tool suitable for that operation for every type of surgical procedure.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you should know that these operations indicate to you the species of tool you need for it when you have a study of length.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art serves as testimony to the symptoms of illness: then you will indeed find through yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments needed for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will stand by you at the end of this chapter to give you a numbered list of tools that you place examples on which you cut into, and the test through which you experience others.
Forma Serrae.	The Serration Form.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another serration.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of the other serration.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of the other serration.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depiction of the Serrae form, let it be done correctly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the upper part of its arc be made, its sharpness from iron: and let its handle be made of wax, and let it be pyramidally formed with a slight offset.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor junctions.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the form of the star-headed clapper: and let its points be according to the form of the tips of the elishafi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless they are rubbed against its heads when they are being damaged or the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the wider razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor that has a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another (smaller) razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the other razor with curved ends.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the feather-like razor, with a slender test.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor used for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also, the form of the large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a rod, and its end is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places according to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that conforms to the bone which has been pierced.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The end of it is triangular, sharp-pointed is the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it must be that all things we have said about Rasories, Cutters, and Files are done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Section 4: On the incision of extremities, and Sealing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Title LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities decay, either due to an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	So then, when you have treated that decay with medical remedies and the treatment does not work: and you see the decay affecting the body part, which is not being affected by anything: then it is necessary to cut that body part until you reach where the decay follows up, so that the diseased person can be saved through this means from death, or from harm that is greater than the defect of a body part.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that happens is this: that the affected member diminishes until it's thought that: which fire has burned it down, or has turned it black before it putrefies: until that decay spreads to what follows that body part and seeps into the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when you have made the cut, and similarly if the cause of decay is from the impact by some venomous creatures: such as sea scorpions, snakes, vipers, and similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the decay or impact is on the end of a finger, then cut the finger and do not leave space for the decay to spread until it reaches the other part of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens to the hand, then cut it from the base of the wrist bone and do not leave space for decay until it reaches into the ulna.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades him, then strike the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	And if corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow region: then there is death among the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer more than that from treatment, is the quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do it for the foot, when corruption invades a finger, then strike at one of its nodes: and if it reaches the instep of the foot, then strike the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	And if it rises to the knee, then strike the shank at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	Now if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in that, unless dismissal and leaving the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of striking the limb, or binding it is, to tighten the ligament below where you wish to strike: and tighten another ligament above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the attendant stretch one ligament downwards: and let the attendant stretch another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then strike it or bind it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it should be that you lay linen bandages from all sides, and the spatula does not touch the healthy area: and there is damage added to the sick person, and a hot pus forms.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	And if there is an internal bleeding while you are working, then quickly cauterize the area: or place some blood-absorbing powders on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then attach the injured member with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot, this is the same event that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happens is that a blackness occurs in his foot, akin to the smoulder which resembles combustion from fire: and this corruption first happens in his finger until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man treated himself after he saw the corruption invade his limb with his own illness, which he discovered due to his pain and its smoulder: and it occurred at the operation, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time has passed for him, the same corruption happens to him in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He comes to me, and I tried to restore that excess with what I had placed on his hand from the medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not restored, it began spreading to another finger until it started affecting his whole hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called upon me to cut off his hand: and I did not agree with that, hoping for the return of that excess from my part: and I was also afraid he might die at the operation on his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the strength of the man was above the situation.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterwards, when he had lost hope in me, he returned to his own land. And news reached me about him because of what happened, and his whole hand was affected. He was then healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not omit this recounting, only for it to be an aid on what falls within this kind of illness's category: and as a representation through which it is expressed and according to how it is handled.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the care of Sinuses, and the quality of cathartics with medicines.
Caput XC.	Title XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fatty parts of the body and the space of the abscess is prolonged until a collection of pus forms; then it is punctured or cut, and what is inside comes out from the pus, leaving a vacuous place as if it were a cavity: and the skin above it behaves like a thin fabric that has been stretched. And it does not reach its end in its corruption, nor does it spread into the mouth, nor into the nerve, nor into the ligament; it deserves to be called a sinus: but is not called a fistula. However, if the space of this prolongs until the corruption spreads into one of these parts, then it is called a fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care in such cases is to completely incise that skin as if it has been rolled out: and especially when it has been stretched thin like a fabric. And you can trust that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you fear that the skin might adhere and not allow the final corruption to spread outwards, then take care with a cathartic: and it's like considering for a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has an unpleasant odor, then cathartically treat it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, using equal parts. Mix them in a container and heat them over fire until the medicine turns red. Then it should thicken like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, then cathartically use it on the sinus: and tighten its opening and pour the medicine into it to the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with exposure: perform this for days until the sinus is cleansed and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is enemas with ashes' water that are used when this medicine is not available to you. And there's a way for you to take the wood ash of vine trees or ash from holly wood and pour that water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then apply her to it and use this for enemas until you're convinced that the sinus has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	And if the weak cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ashes' water, then use enemas with water and honey, to which a bit of powdered zinc has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or use enemas with honey and wine mixed together, as honey has the property of cleansing and washing away. Wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of coagulation and drying properties in wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	And when you perform this several times and are convinced that the corruption within the sinus is gone, then use it with what causes flesh to regenerate in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And you should take from the plaster of yafinicon: dissolve it with rose oil and stinging nettle wine. Or use it with certain medicines and other ointments; their properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	And if the sinus opening is tight and does not accept the cannula for enemas, then widen it with iron slightly. Or place inside it, wrapped in ointment, either Egyptian or basil ointment until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if there is even an enlarged opening, then gather its edges with stitches and take the quantity that can accept enemas without any addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening through which the pus runs is elevated above, then cut it down into the lower area within him, so that the pus can flow from there to below until under: because when the pus is constrained deep inside a sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around below him as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation that allows the pus to flow out of it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing remains of the pus within it entirely: and take strengthening medicines which are put on signs, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a piece of linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such size that it can accommodate (cover) the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors through the central opening of the sinus, somewhat wider than the sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread another piece of ointment cloth over the cloth, according to the size of the opening: and place it on top of it in a position far from the sinus opening, so that the exit of pus from there is facilitated: and do not remove a large piece of cloth until after a few days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That which is above the sinus opening, that which you remove at all times, so that what accumulates in it from pus can go out: and to know whether the thing that flows out of it is much or little: or well digested or indigestible.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And after this again consider the location of the sinus itself, does the owner feel pain there or is there no pain? And is there a boil in it or is there no boil.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When your treatment thus extends and you see the material that comes out over the sinus opening, then you will know that the sinus is already adhering or closely approaching adherence. Therefore, then divide it in the morning or on the third day: and when you divide the wound, then change another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If it emerges from the sinus after a long span of the subtle poison, then do not despair about its adhesion, for its healing is approaching. For there are humans who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them are those who act contrary to him.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If instead it emerges from the sinus after many days of undigested pus, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed and prolonged: then add to the drying medicines, but let the doctors do this, so that they are medicines in their substance wet, and in their action dry: such as the unguentum dyafinicon, when it has been added to him an excess addition from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the very end of treatment, it is that you receive the unguentum dyafinicon and it is dissolved with rose oil, and it is fomented over it an old wine of equal substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it performs an action similar to this when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present, use honey, when you decoct it until it thickens and then use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloen, and olibanum: grind the whole of it, and crush that with honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread it over the surface of the wound, and bind it to the sinus: and spread with honey that you have decocted until it has thickened, and crush a mixture over it, and place it on top of the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And occasionally it is administered with long aristolochia and roots of the heavenly lily, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaurium.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simples, or combined, cleanse them and sieve itself: and grind it over the honey I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the Sinus lasts and does not heal with this treatment, then you will know that there is a deep corruption within it. Or perhaps it is already making an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments. Then treat it with Fistular cure as provided beforehand.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	¶ On the treatment of gangrene and worn nails, along with additional cuts to the finger, and severance.
Caput XCI.	Head 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Gangrene is an abscess that arises under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and perhaps also in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	And when thus it lasts and the treatment is neglected, and the abscess is treated with hot application: or if corruption occurs and pus is emitted until it rots the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupted it all, and perhaps the corruption reached to the gum until it produces a foul smell; then the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color turns to dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When then you treat it, following what we said about division, and if your treatment does not heal completely; then you must cut all the remaining excess from the nail with a blade.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, an application of the cautery is very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	But if the gum is healthy and even the nail itself is also healthy, and holes vacuous in the nail have already squeezed flesh towards the inside, and begin to prick it themselves and damage it: then you should place a fine piece of the cautery under the corner of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards. And cut that flesh with ease, and place over what remains of the flesh that is from medicaments causing burning and corrosion until everything has been removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care that when the ointment is applied until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	And if corruption has already spread into the mouth, then you must open that mouth and remove it: for the diseased mouth never heals while it remains there.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	And if you see corrosion and decay spreading into a finger, then cut it off at the joint, according to what was previously mentioned in this reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	And if it happens through friction of the nail or impact: and there is intermittent pain in that area, then it is necessary to use a bloodletting on the affected part first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut off the nail with an acute, sharp spathili (surgical knife) cutting across from above to downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, for that would result in severe pain on the affected part and be a cause of the growth of added flesh at the location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the site with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger that grows in some human hands might be entirely fleshly. There may also be bones in others of them; and perhaps there is a nail in it. Some of them grow from the joint's root, or its birthplace could be in certain joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	The one that grows at the joints of the finger does not move. And the one that grows near the joint of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, for the one among them that is entirely fleshly, its cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That means you should cut it at its root with a broad spathili (a type of surgical knife).
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment for him whose birth is at the junction's root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, refrain from operating on him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In the case where he is born at the last node near the tip of the finger, then you must make an incision into his flesh with a round cut up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Next, place the opening of this tool in accordance with these other tools that fit together with it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	A consolidation that occurs between digits very often happens either due to the person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of wounds, or from burns and similar incidents.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, one must remove that consolidation until the digits return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a ligature, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the area consolidates according to what is needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if there happens to be a consolidation among some fingers with the palm, then remove that consolidation according to how the preparation and fitting of the member's figure is done.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Section on Incision: An Error.
Caput XCII.	Title 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are rolled up, large, filled with superfluous melancholic substances which happen in many parts of the body: and for the most part their occurrences are in the legs, particularly in the legs that walk, labor, and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer bloodletting from the body with black bile at intervals by strong bleeding.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, for the bloodletting of the patient, use the basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	The first of them is that they should take baths and bleed out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the second method is to remove the vein itself and bleed it completely out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	As for cutting it, it is done according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Firstly immerse the leg up to the ankle in warm water for quite some time, until the thick and fatty blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg of the sick person from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee with an application.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise it, that is, draw the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and at the top it must be done by the phlebotomist for the sick person.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail down to where it is possible: until an amount of blood flows out that you see sufficient, and that which the strength of the sick person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it up and instruct him to avoid foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are filled and it harms the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, the raising (or bleeding) of this is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him/her into the bath: or soak his/ her leg in warm water until it turns red and the veins swell: or exercise vigorously if there is no bath available, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin directly through the length of the artery section: or at its end near the knee joint, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until you see it with your senses: and there appears what you see going from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	And when it flows out of the skin, you will see it white as if it were a chord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the rod under it until when it rises and exits through the skin: hang it with a blind hook gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until you see it.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with the Radiums as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section or multiple sections if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it up and perform the final operation at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you extract it from the higher section, or with all upper sections until when it exits completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not obey you to extract or lift: then insert a needle with a strong double thread and tie it, then extract it. Or insert the rod under it: and turn your hand around all parts until it exits.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut too deeply.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you cut too deep, it will be very difficult for you to lift her up and it may cause harm to the frail one above.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted it all, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil or oil on the wound site, and attend to it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If Vine (the plant) is contracted, having a curvature leading to rolling towards parts, and it is not as we said according to the straightness: then it must be that you bind over it across all parts of its curvature, and places of rolling of itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all; and be cautious at your cut above it not to hit a vein or wounds: for it will be difficult for you to lift it off, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	So keep your caution, therefore.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the incident, according to how it heals Vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the blind knot.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not healed in the same way as with other knots, nor does it have a sharp tip so as not to pierce a vein: and it has a large degree of bending that is soft. For if it were subtle, it would cut the subtlety of its point: indeed, there is an excess of size for it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the femoral vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs on hot lands, such as Alizay, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot, thinly fertile lands, that is, those where no grass or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the decay that occurs under the skin, just as it happens within bodies of snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The sign of occurrence for this vein's outcome is that inflammation happens urgently in the arm.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area is vesicated.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that vesiculated area, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore an end of it appears from there, then you must cover over the part of it that is as long as a piece of lead, which weighs up to one and a half drachms, until it reaches two drachms: and suspend the hanging weight from the arm.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something emerges from there towards the outside, cover that with lead and mark it with a node.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends greatly, then take out its portion, and cover the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it to its root until it has completely emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it constricts and penetrates into the flesh: and it causes a pustule to occur, and pus in the area, and an evil ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until the very end of it emerges, so that nothing remains from there within the body: and thus this vein extends to a length of five palms and ten in some people.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it reaches me, because it has emerged from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however you come across it during your treatment time: then insert the root into its opening and puncture it from that opening long, with the body, until all that is inside of it in the material comes out: and administer putrefaction to the site with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for it during the treatment of pustules.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	This indeed refers to a vein which sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint, or within the foot itself. And multiple openings occur with it, and each branch exits through every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat her (the patient) as we advised in the division [of treatment], and along with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Section 4: Concerning worms generated under the skin, it is called Bovine Brevity (or perhaps Bovine Distress).
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 924.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This condition is named Bovine Distress in a certain land among us: hence, because it often happens to cows, and there is a single thin worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it traverses the entire body, moving up and down: and during its movement one can perceive it by touch while walking from limb to limb, until wherever it breaks, it emerges into the skin.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its production is from the corruption of certain body fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just like other worms and snakes, that is to say, roundworms and hookworms, within the intestines.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malevolence.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it moves within the body and rises to the head, and arrives at a spot, then perhaps it opens there and emerges, and destroys an eye: this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	So when you intend to treat and extract it, then this does not occur unless during its movement and revelation by touch.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, one must bind what is above it, and that which is below along with the constricting ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates deeply into the flesh and you do not find him: then place a cautery with fire on the spot until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared more is its decay, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see that it has already reached near the head towards the eye, then bind under it a good forehead band.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person uses the purification of their body with medicines that dissolve bad pus and mucus.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that cause corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ On cutting above the sickness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called Nakir in our land: it is pain that occurs in certain limbs, and then shifts from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen it myself, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to attend a woman who is sick in some parts of her body.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed for one hour, I saw another swelling move like a little flame, as if it were a worm ascending to the shoulder faster than possible: let it be like silver in motion when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain left that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then sit for an hour, and it will run through the rest of the body until it reaches another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was circulating throughout his entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed by the speed of its exchange from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before this, I had not seen this illness with my eyes to such an extent according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find the pain changing from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not consider that to be so, but because it was from those who were among the discoveries of dry body veins found in women: thus it is evident to the senses that that windiness has changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delightful and have moist bodies, of the veins that are hidden.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	And when you wish to apply treatment to this, and the patient senses that pain: then if it appears to you as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly. And cut above it, until that confined windiness can escape: and burn the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	And if you do not see it with your own eyes: then take care of it with the removal of the body and what drives out winds, and treat those winds with stinking pills, and pills from poppy seeds, and similar remedies.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows vary according to their types and where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their variety is as follows: for among them there are those with large and small points; and concave ones, and flat ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them, which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	But those that are according to limbs in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed the limbs are from the main limbs being concave, such as the brain, and heart, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	So when it falls into any of these limbs, and you see the signs of death that I told you about, then you must know how to extract that arrow from them, for death follows it wherever it is, in various dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and attend to the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For signs when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the mouth, and comes out from the siphon above the brain: because things happen from it such as sweat constantly, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and red tongue, and spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of choler.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may come out through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is lost and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And it comes out from the wound area, a white moisture resembling putty.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it exits from there like bodily fluid.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore you see these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	However, the signs when an arrow falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple: and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of an arrow is similar to the beat of a pulse, and it runs from the wound with black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this is followed by coldness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and convulsions.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know then that death is certainly descending.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is the efflux of foamy blood from the wound. And the veins which follow the neck, are constricted, and the color of the sick changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales the great breath, deeply, and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, then it's near thin ribs: and a great breath with intense pain, with sighing, occurs; and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will come out of the wound from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and lodges there, something of feces will come out from the wound, or fat, or an intestine that has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for its treatment, nor for the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine is discharged; and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and the pain becomes stronger than the sick person's condition: then you will know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, helper bone, vertebral process, sternal angle, thigh, and similar parts are diagnosed according to various positions based on whether the arrow does not find an artery or nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I have seen about these arrows so that you may understand through this regarding your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What is this, because some eagle has fallen an arrow into the lacrimal sac of its eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I removed it myself from the other part, under the fat of its ear: and he was healed, and no harm befalls him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I removed another arrow of a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not get it out except for its thin end, with which it adheres to its own wood: and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the Turkish bow, made of soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew was healed, and no harm befalls him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and that is what has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it between two guide wires: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I managed to remove it carefully until I took it out: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I removed another arrow from the bird which had fallen into its belly: and we thought it would die from that.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterwards, thirty days passed for him and nothing had changed in his condition regarding it, so I followed the arrow. And I devised a plan to remove it, and I removed it: and he was healed, and no harm befalls him anymore.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen on his back and the wound had healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterwards, when it had been seven years, an arrow came out from the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her abdomen, and a scar was formed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and she did not experience any change in her usual condition at all, and the woman did not find him harmful in any way from her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and a scar was formed, and remained, not finding him much pain: and many things like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And an arrow was extracted from the king's officials by me, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and it was now slightly moving towards the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was summoned for his treatment after the case of the arrow up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the scar of the arrow very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I examined her with delicate probing and did not feel it: indeed, he himself was experiencing a puncture and pain under his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that the said puncture was at the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I treated the area with a plaster containing an adhesive and digestive properties, believing that it would harden and show me a sign of the arrow, allowing me to cut over it. And there was no occurrence at the location that indicated the arrow had followed through the area.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated him with the plaster over it for many days: and there were no occurrences, and the scar hardened in the meantime: and he remained weak due to its removal until he felt an arrow within his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed a sharp medicinal ointment, a corrosive, for many days on it, until the wound opened. And having tried and probed myself, and felt the fine point of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added through that sharp medicinal ointment in the wound opening until we could clearly see the end of the arrow: and it took me about four months with this.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had expanded, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move them around without yielding, I would continue working on it with ingenuity and various tools until one day I began using forceps of proper size. According to their shape at the tip of the tool, I finally managed to extract it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed physicians say that the nasal cartilage does not get restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick person was healed with complete health; nothing harmed her at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of this type of arrow extraction: so that you may take this as a rule and understanding beyond what I did not mention.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this craft and their distinctions are not covered by the narration. Neither does this book cover it, nor does a wise artisan compare with little for much: and when there is what is present in front of him, he considers beyond that which is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new tool at the descent of matters needing to be extraneous to this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say that arrows do not leave the parts to which they are attached unless according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	By means of its own force from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or conversely from the other side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered, or is the arrow proceeding into a fleshly place: and it is drawn out, and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	And if it does not yield to exit at the hour when it falls: then you should release it for a few days until the flesh around it decays: and its attraction will weaken and its departure will occur.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it becomes stuck in bone and does not yield to you for exiting, then release it as well for a few days: and each day apply the force and motion along with its attraction until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	And if it does not yield to you for exiting after days, then you should bore around the area of the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine tool until the arrows expand.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	And if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone, and has already proceeded into one of the brain cavities, and there appear some of the phenomena which I mentioned due to this: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and release it until it becomes equal to its usual state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow has reached such depths, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in a body of bone only, and does not penetrate up to such depths: and he remains sick for a few days, and none of those events happens to him: then apply cleverness in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	And if it is fixed strongly, and does not yield to you for attracting: then apply drills around the area of the arrow as I have instructed: afterwards take care of the site until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If indeed the arrow is already removed from the body location, and hidden and concealed from perception: then seek it out with testing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you sense it, then draw it out with certain tools that suit its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot get to it above it, due to the constriction of the wound and due to the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no opening, nor nerve, nor vein there: then press down on it until the wound widens and making it possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if there are ears around which it is held, then free the attached flesh in them from all sides, with every means you can use to do that, and try tools as well if not possible through persuasion of flesh in fracturing the ears and twisting them until they fit.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any location, then use the twisting motion of your hand with forceps on all parts until you make it come out: and use the most delicate technique possible so that the arrow is not broken, and making its extraction difficult for you and itself.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it all at once, then let it go for a few days until the surroundings are rotten due to it.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then continue with it: indeed, the needle will be of help. If however, the blood flow opposes you, then administer what we said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from the cut of a vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the technique in every way that is possible for you to extract the arrow: and let this be with ease, and calmness, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And you must do it when you pull the arrow, so that it becomes weak according to the figure, according to how it was with the case of the arrow within itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however, it is not possible for you to do this, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that leaves from the opposite part of another, or now proceeds from it something to the outside: or makes a protuberance on the tip of the arrow due to sensation through the upper part of the adjacent skin and you see it protruding: therefore cut over it, and let the section be according to the amount that they take in such instruments.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull her (towards you): indeed she becomes easy for removal.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if she is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow imprints itself in the bone and expands herself: then pull her (the arrow) out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let her go for a few days, then try again until she leaves (or exits).
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	But if the arrowwood of the arrow is there, then push it with her (the arrow).
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the arrowwood fell and you are unable to administer a thrust: then insert that instrument concave into her, so that the concavity of it enters into the tail of the arrow: then push her with him.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the Arrow is concave, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow is moved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then you must make the entire flesh concave, in which there is poison: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	And then take care of her (the patient) with what is suitable for that matter.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side: and is close to what you touch with your finger because it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and be careful not to damage the vein, or nerve, and extract her.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then examine the wound, if you see one, and attend to it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the pincers used for extracting arrows.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	They have ends similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they catch onto an arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	Many kinds of them are made from these, large ones and small ones, as well as medium-sized ones, according to the size of the arrow, its quality, the extent of the wound, and how it is constricted.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the impelling instrument is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the impelling device for the deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is how it is with the end of the device for the deaf like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be facilitated and pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This is the concave end of the impelling device, like a feather of a bird: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its propulsion may be facilitated.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	¶ Concerning venepuncture.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 57.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins for venepuncture, which flow customarily through the body, amount to thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Among which, sixteen are found in the head: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears and called 'the twos'; and two arteries that appear in both temples: and two veins that are located in the tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called 'looking veins': and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and the vein found at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two guide veins, which are located in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins that are used for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic vein, and it comes from the side of the sunflower: and the common name for this is the head vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Black one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the Middle vein, and it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the cephalic: and they call this commonly the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica vein, and it is located on the domestic side: it is also named Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And they call this commonly the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the Brachial cord, and it is placed above the ulnar region: that is the one where bloodletting is performed, and that is the one which appears above the thumb in a clear manifestation.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Saluatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and there are two branches for it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the knee and in the foot, there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is the vein which is under the curvature of the thumb on the domestic side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second one is the Saphenous vein: its location is at the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the Nesse vein: its location is at the heel on the sunflower side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And there are three other veins similar to those in the groin.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	On bloodletting with two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Bloodletting with two veins that are located after the ears is beneficial for old coughs, and headache, and earache, and bad head wounds.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting is as I describe it.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And this is done by cutting the head of the sick person: and the back of their head is rubbed with a coarse cloth at the place where the two veins are, using good rubbing action.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the sick person should tighten their neck with a bandage until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And the sites of these (two) veins are behind the ears at two depressed spots on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	So search for these veins with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there mark them with a hot rod.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the bloodletting instrument, it is called the 'Incident'.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein into the skin until the bloodletting tool reaches the mouth of the wound.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the bloodletting tool at that location.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the cut be approximately two fingers joined together, or about that measure: and make as much blood flow out as you can.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with the ashes, and release it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now at the beginning of this book, there follows an incision into them and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	On bloodletting using two arteries at times.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Two arteries though, which are in the two times of bloodletting, contribute to benefit, for the ancient headache: and the weak, and the watering eyes frequently: and the discharge of excessive flowing liquids to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of bloodletting is as I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Tie the weak person's neck tightly until two veins become clearly visible: and show that their pulse can be felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then, with these signs, apply a heated instrument.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin over the vein with your index finger and introduce a bloodletting tool below it, lifting the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it as you did with the other two veins: and make to flow from the blood according to the quantity needed for your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then relieve the constriction of the patient and place your finger on the vein at one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then place a cloth and small clothes over it, and tie them tightly above the constriction: and remove it until healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And now we refer back to those, and their incision, and removal at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	On forehead bloodletting after cephalic bloodletting.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	The benefit of forehead bloodletting is after cephalic bloodletting, for the old complaints of the face: and for headaches, redness: and foul sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of this bloodletting is as I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	Amputate the sick person's neck along with the skin, until a vein becomes visible.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the tool that is called the Fossilium.
Cuius haec est forma.	And this is its shape.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the prominent point which is at the head of the Fossilium over the vein and strike it with the tibia or with another tool in a similar manner, and let the blood flow according to the amount of force you use.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then widen the puncture in the patient, and tighten it until healing occurs.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes an opening is made with a broad bloodletting tool.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that the bloodletting tool has a sharp end, like other bloodletting tools. Instead, it should have a broad end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the bloodletting tool should be aligned according to the curvature: because there is a proximity of an opening: and perhaps when it is thin, the bloodletting tool may break within it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	¶ Concerning bloodletting from veins in two lacrimal areas.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The benefit of the two veins that are in the two lacrimal areas, each for one eye, is for scabies and redness on both eyes: and irritation in the eye, and discomforts on the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of bloodletting from these is for the patient to tighten their neck with the skin.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then perform bloodletting on them: and you should stand above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And bloodletting should be done according to the curvature, somewhat along the length, with a small but broad tool, because there is no flesh in that area.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	If indeed the bloodletter is delicate at the extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then let as much blood run out from your wound as necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place them over the wounds, and tie them at night once, and release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	¶ Concerning the venous bloodletting of Nasir's method.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Nasir's venous bloodletting procedure is aimed at acute fevers and severe weakness, as well as facial discomforts such as migraine headaches and redness that occur on the face: especially when it is recurrent.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of his bloodletting treatment is such that the patient should tighten their weak neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold the nose of the one with your left hand, and take a delicate and long bloodletting tool. Place it in the middle of the rabbit, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to touch there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the bloodletting tool slightly apart: and let the blood run out according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie that [the bloodletting] at night once.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it restores itself quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	¶ Concerning the venous bloodletting of Guidgeghi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Two of Guidegi's bloodletting treatments are helpful for constriction of breath, and the onset of leprosy, as well as melancholic discomforts, and impetigo and bad sores, and those that eat away, that is, herpes-like conditions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And what quality of bloodletting is this that a sick person should be tightened under both his neck with the bandage: and the surgeon stands above the sick's head, and the sick sits on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then for bloodletting take one tube that is approximately as long as the bloodletting procedure requires, slightly wider.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then remove from the blood an appropriate amount, or according to that which you see fit due to the necessity of the situation.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Next, do likewise with another tube.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Then release the bandage and bind two tubes halfway around each other: so that the sick person is not burned.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let it be until noon.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	¶ Concerning the bloodletting tubes of Alghabr.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	As for Alghabr's bloodletting method, it is helpful with respect to alcohol and gum decay, bad sores, and even cuts of the lips and mouth. It can also be used effectively on ulcers found within the nose and around the nostrils.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of these bloodletting procedures is such that you should have the sick person sit before you: and bind their neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Next, turn his lips and look at the two tubes: one is from the right lip, and the other from the left side of him. And each demonstration is shown through the stain on the vessel.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because there are small, dark veins around them.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, make both cuts in an opposing direction of the incisions.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If however there is doubt upon you and you do not know which one it is: then aim towards the larger cut and the more obvious of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with two (wounds) which are in the upper lip: and there is considerable custom with it; and strike down the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Regarding phlebotomy, venipuncture under the tongue follows head phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Two veins that are under the tongue contribute to phlebotomy: it is useful that the head phlebotomy is for preparations in the throat, and nausea of the stomach, and the ills of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of the one performing phlebotomy is that the sick person should sit between your hands in front of the sun: and lift his/her tongue, and look under the tongue from the side of him/her one vein, and from the other side of him/her another vein: and each color goes towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore perform both phlebotomies: and guard against touching your last hand upon the veins during the procedure.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For there are arteries under it, and perhaps blood flow may occur from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Regarding the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that undergo phlebotomy in the elbow are those in which custom dictates a procedure in all humans.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of these occurs according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by piercing with a myrtle-stick phlebotome: or by applying oil for gentle descent: or by cutting with a surgical knife, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is suitable for cutting, as it pertains to the form for sectioning.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are forms that are broad and subtle according to the width of the veins and their tension. The form of a myrtle-stick phlebotome is broad as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is appropriate for veins, being full, proceeding, visible, thick ones, as well as those containing thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width and more slender in its extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for performing bloodletting on small veins which contain subtle yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Regarding basilica phlebotomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the basilica is one of these three types of vein for phlebotomy that proves useful.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, following the breast and belly: and it is appropriate for the phlebotomy instrument with the phlebotomat to be cautious about it, as it should be above fear of that place because there is an artery beneath.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	So if it goes wrong and adds to the phlebotomy point, it will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to use him with the pricking phlebotomy tool: indeed, let him be sliding against Alnisil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation then it is necessary to remove that one and try another or search for another branch. Or use a phlebotomy tool in place of it, like the biceps vein.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	She is indeed clear and can be cut with the phlebotomy tool Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you are performing phlebotomy from this one himself, then it is necessary before the constriction of the biceps that you touch the site until you recognize the pulse point.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the site above with a hot iron, afterwards the biceps, and cut the vein in a concave section with the phlebotomy tool Alnisil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let the blow not fall in the space where the artery is located.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that upon tightening the band, there is an expansion at the place you marked with the cautery, then that expansion is the pulse. Therefore, it must be treated accordingly.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	And if you see blood rising at the time of bloodletting, like urine in a child, and it is thin, red: then you will know that it comes from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Therefore, proceed quickly, and place your finger on it for a while, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood is therefore withdrawn (since it's withdrawn multiple times), then tighten the arm and release it: and beware that the patient doesn't move from this position due to fear, and let him be comfortable.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move for several days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	And if no blood is withdrawn and you are unable to do so, and there's no medicine available at the moment for you, then cut into the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	Its extremities contract and blood is withdrawn.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a slice of the fijnut tree and grind it. Take half a piece and bind it over the place where the vein is to be bound, with bandage and wadding until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is withdrawn, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then take care of it with him who was reminded before about the location where powders for bloodletting are used: and the removal of his blood is not difficult in many situations because of the scarcity of wounds and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On Bloodletting for the Scorpion Sting.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins for bloodletting are useful, which draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body. Therefore, since it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the bloodletting procedure that the phlebotomy be above the fear, because there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the site of the bloodletting, and finds a nerve, it happens in that area of stupefaction, and his healing becomes difficult, and perhaps he may not be fully healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But in some people it may be hidden, and it is subtle, and not visible: then you must put your bloodletting where you can find the vein, cut with an Alnus knife, and guide the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	And if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is useful because it draws blood from the head and helps alleviate eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, to puncture the Cephalic vein with an oil-based phlebotome or with a myrtle-based phlebotome: because it is healthier than all veins, as it does not have a buried artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, when you are doing the bloodletting procedure, it is fitting that you aim with the phlebotome just above the head of the insect and look for a softer area: and it does not harm him if there was no discovery upon the first impact, so that he can be repeatedly pricked with the phlebotome.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps there are some individuals who might develop an abscess when not treated with bloodletting during the initial percussion, but this does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	The Utility of Bloodletting and Precautions to be Taken in its Application.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of bloodletting and the events associated with it come down to your consideration in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you need to understand for what reason bloodletting should be done - it is administered only with the preservation of health and perseverance in its use, and caution against the onset of illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And for the bloodletting to be done through one of the three veins found at the bend of the arm, namely the cephalic vein, the femoral vein, and the basilic vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, truly, and in Summer: and Autumn, and Winter after digestion, when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting should be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from dawn each day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, bloodletting that is administered during illness does not have a set time; but when it is appropriate and necessary for that purpose, it can be done at night, or day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary to perform bloodletting on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	And pregnancy does not require bloodletting unless from the fourth to the seventh day after menstruation.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And old men do not undergo bloodletting, who have already passed sixty years of age.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	And when anyone wishes to be bled for any reason: they should cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is much retained feces in them: so that noxious excesses from the intestines do not attract veins during bloodletting towards harmful limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	The patient is not subjected to bloodletting, that is, the nausea-inducing satiety: nor after drinking or recovering from drunkenness, until they are rid of this by them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	The sick person with hydrocele.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bloodletting be avoided after a bout of colic, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and after sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissipates strength from bodily or animal vigor.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of fluids beforehand, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for this to be done.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then, if something does not prohibit it, take a bath, or engage in some exercise to thicken the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the bloodletting in his chest on the third day, as we said, and try to allow all bodily maladies out of him that day: such as distress, anger, fear, and all bodily ills like labor, punishment, overindulgence, and similar issues.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his seat be surrounded by present things with which the habit of men runs in use from their aroma, fragrance, delight, and similar items through the possibility of quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bloodletter should sit above the blood basin which is higher than the point of bloodletting. Afterwards, he will extend his arm and the bloodletter will rub his hand on it twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie the bandage with correction, and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when an unevenness or excess causes a constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood. Or if there is laxity, then too it prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after ligation, it is necessary that the blood抽出者 rubs his own hands simultaneously together until the veins swell and become evident to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the blood抽出者 should cleanse the blood抽出部位 with a little oil, in an old-fashioned manner.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then place his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the site where he wishes to perform bloodletting, slightly: so that the vein does not escape and percussion is set.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For with veins you find what you discover like a fleeing chord at bloodletting: and from them is that which is full of wind. And when you place the blood抽出者 over it, it contracts under the blood抽出者, and the blood抽出者 gets carried away, and the blood抽出者 does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is ligatured. Therefore, for this reason, it must be that the blood抽出者 is firmly held, and attentive to all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then place down the blood抽出者.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened by one incision, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that incision in another place below that spot, or above it with a slight angle: if the spot is not reached.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	And if it is reached or the patient becomes lax, then dismiss him for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat bloodletting if he wishes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	And if the opening is small, or blood flows subtly; and you measure to ensure not more quantity of blood escapes than desired: then repeat the bloodletting in the same hole according to its orientation, and add a little in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And perform this with urgency before the site is closed, for the site closes in many people during surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see it already closed though, then don't proceed over it at all, for nothing is excused in regard to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from the oil of fat on it: because it promotes the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this is better in this place than the oil itself, and than any other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the oil fat in every bloodletting of yours, where phlebotomies involve needles at the prohibition of blood flow: and they do that with the tyrian alfarach and the sagzenea, when placed from one of them on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood thickens and dissolves when it is coarse.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	And if a large abscess should occur at the site of bloodletting, for this happens many times, especially to those who are not bled except that way or have a small incision in the vein, then hurry and place on the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated moderately: and tighten it for an hour because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should do that after the blood has flowed out from the same vein, with its full amount, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	And if there remains any darkening or greenishness in the site after some days, it does no harm. And if you wish, place on it something from aloe or myrrh that dissolves: or something from the mint juice, that is, of cloves or similar substances.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And it happens quite often for abscesses and swellings to occur near bloodletting in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be cautious, as you place upon it something from what we said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery may flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster with it where there is coagulation, so that the spot may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And you must take out from every person in their blood according to the strength of their health.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what becomes apparent from the color increasing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be expelled until it turns red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick: then expel it until it becomes finer; and similarly, if it is sharp, remove its sharpness until it disappears.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the one who is full and strong, needing extraction of blood with one method, that the phlebotomy should be widened on the vein, and be a lateral phlebotomist: and in the one who is weak, have it opposite to his condition.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extracts through tubes and makes the opening tight: better still than what is administered in vein phlebotomy is a cross section method rather than piercing.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is beneficial from the flow of blood and from cutting nerves: and it is more commendable and safer than phlebotomy through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it has been customary to come about through phlebotomy with syncopics, it is necessary that he eats before phlebotomy a moderate amount of bread soaked in water flavored with guaiac: or cayenne pepper if it's cooked; and from his blood extract him in three tubes, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the patient's complexion has been cooled, then before bloodletting he should take bread infused with honey syrup or an aromatic honey syrup, or an aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if there should occur bloodletting among the gouty, and its cause is the outflow of much blood: then it must take broth water and a subtle aromatic syrup; and use aromatization with herbs, and coat his chest with that; and use what we said about division in chapter on gout from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	And if someone wants to empty his arm and release his blood again: it should be for the person whose bloodletting is due to abundant evacuation, and their strength is weak, that they should release the blood gradually according to the amount of strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	And if someone wants to empty their arm and release their blood again, and their body is strong: then that should be done seven hours later, or nine after the first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	And if someone wants to draw blood from their body towards the opposite side than which it leans: it should be done on the second day or on the third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	And in whose body there is already heated and increasing blood, causing fever to occur: it should be that one blood leaves from him once through the vessel, and a large amount of blood is removed from him. And extend the opening until gout occurs. After you have maintained all the conditions for bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of gout.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed, this happens many times when the bloodletter is unaware and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you are trying to relieve the arm and relieve blood a second time, when the vein's opening has already been closed, and there makes difficult the exit of the blood, that one presses upon it with congestion, and the ligature is extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	And that thing is very bad indeed, even dismiss it until the second blood-letting takes place.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove that which has coagulated from the blood with the sharpness of the phlebotomy tool in the opening of the vein, and place something of salt dissolved in water over it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from tarry asphalt or zinc over it, and apply it with gentle compression until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed there is already an abscess in the vein, then remove it, and do not hold it until the abscess settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity prompts a second blood-letting and there is no excuse, then either use the phlebotomy tool over that place, or elsewhere on the arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Then the cord of the arm is used for blood-letting at the location of the Fossa and Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it consists of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this blood-letting is that a sick person inserts his hand into warm water until it turns red and the vein appears distinctly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then, when it is inserted, apply it with a ligature with moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy tool should be used gradually across it, not lengthwise, nor in a straight line, and there should be an ample opening so that your blood-letting method can operate effectively over the connection of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If blood flow is obstructed, then repeatedly submerge your hand in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve what you require.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you find yourself in days of summer, then refrain from repeatedly immersing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	A great deal of blood flow is indeed put into the warm water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	This particular type of bloodletting is healthier than all veins, because there is neither a pulsating vein nor a nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bloodletting using the method of Salutation's hand on the right is effective in relieving ailments of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this method of bloodletting is such that you would grip the hand with the ligament or your own hand after introducing it into warm water until the vein inflates and its sensation becomes very evident.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, perform bloodletting by passing over it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you hit it completely, that will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And conserve, do not withdraw your hand with the bloodletting tool.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For there are nerves of the fingers exposed under it from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeatedly immerse your hand in warm water and allow the blood to flow within it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not immerse it repeatedly in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the vein's opening and obstruct its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	So when you have extracted the required amount from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not quickly harden or coagulate.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, you should do this with every tightened branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The reduction for his bloodletting is from his left hand, because it corresponds to spleen disorders: and similarly perform the bloodletting on him like you did in the second part equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The reduction for saphenous bloodletting is useful against illnesses which occur in the lower part of the body, such as symptoms related to the uterus and retention of menstrual flow, kidney issues, old sores on thighs and legs, and similar complaints.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his bloodletting is such that the sick should immerse their foot into warm water and do rubbing until the veins overflow; then tie above the wound on the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The site of the veins is indeed located at the heel, facing towards the big toe, and branches out from there into many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, the bloodletting should be performed on that larger branch of the veins or where they gather at the heel as it is better for health.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you perform bloodletting on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And suppose your bloodletting is like crossing over the area you intend to bleed from, as if you are about to hit it. Let the person performing the bloodletting be named Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is being obstructed though, then immerse his foot into warm water. And let the blood flow into that area until it is drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the bloodletting practitioner goes wrong in the first attempt, then continue with the bloodletting upwards for some distance, because it is safe there, and you do not fear any harm when you avoid nerves as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly when the saphenous vein of the other foot is equal.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the lateral side of the foot.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the beneficial aspect of this bloodletting is, for alleviating ankle pain, when it's due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the nature of this bloodletting is such that it should have access to the patient's bath and cool down; and encircle the ankle bone from the side to above the heel by four fingers, with a long slim tool: for it does not appear otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	So when it becomes visible, then for the bloodletting you should perform as much as your skill allows, or according to the inversion: and it is better if you make an incision into her or cut through with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The location of this is for the benefit and it is extremely hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then for bloodletting choose one of its branches, and that which appears in the heel and towards the earlobe will be it. And beware of nerves, and make flow from the blood as much as you can wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then release the constriction and place a piece of leather over the bloodletting site, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	Indeed, it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ About Ventilation, and the nature of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilation can be caused by horns, and by air, and by wind.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And indeed, Ventilation occurs in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	Concerning incision and bloodletting: one method is ventosa without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this type of ventosa which is performed without an incision, can be done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it could be done with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it can be done without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the places on the body where bloodletting is performed with incision and bloodletting are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	And there are fourteen places on the body where bloodletting is performed with incision and bleeding. One of these is Alnocrati's ventosa, which is at the very back of the head: another is Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; there are two Alhagdahim ventosas, being the two layers of the neck from both sides simultaneously: a ventosa on the chin, under the jawbone at the lower part of the mouth; a ventosa of two scapulae; one ventosa above the end of the tail for Alachosos; two ventosas of the forearms, they are in the middle of the two arms; there are two ventosas of thighs: and two ventosas of kidneys.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the ventosa does not draw blood from small holes scattered in the flesh. Henceforth, its power does not fall from them as it is with bloodletting by phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should the ventosa be administered with fire or without it for any illness that arises from excessive fullness until the entire body is relieved.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts to use the ventosa for illness or due to habit at any time during the beginning of a month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who when their blood increases in him, until it needs to be extracted through ventosa, they find heaviness and soreness on his head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is he who finds fullness and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is he who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness, and confusion of vision in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is the person who trembles at the place of their windpipe.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is the person who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue swells and ejects blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is he whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is he who sees blood and redness, and dead bodies, and wounds, and things similar to those in his sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	So when we see something from these [conditions], and especially if it occurs on the third day of a month: then we predict that there will be wind starting after passing two or three hours from the end of the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The discomfort of the wind in the neck is: because it tends towards heaviness in the head, and what is released goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be that this occurs after a full body evacuation.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed what is known as the cephalic bloodletting wind.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use this (therapy) for those with cold constitutions or where there's phlegm.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great harm to her.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not allowed to use these for old people and those with cold ailments on their head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Those who are constantly with her (medicine), she generates forgetfulness for him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason, it is necessary to instruct the Venerable one (Ventosator), so that he abstains from his hand with the vomiting potion only in short intervals, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Venerisatio or Alkehel is akin to the bloodletting of Fucus and the bloodletting from Basilica. And due to this it brings on asthma-like conditions, constriction during inspiration, tearing of instruments during inspiration, coughing, and fullness after use.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to apply the Venerisator (Alkehel) only locally, because if it's placed lower down, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Venerisatio or Alhagdahim, however, causes pain in the head and eye affections, and headache, perforation, and toothache pains: it is akin to bloodletting from the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to instruct the Venerable one (Ventosator), not to press his hand with scarification: so as not to hit a blood vessel and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Venerisatio at the chin leads to alcohol accumulation in the mouth, and gum decay, and similar issues that occur inside the mouth: it corresponds to bloodletting from Alieherich which is situated on both cheeks.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Venerisatio using spatulas results in the formation of Alkafa (a kind of heat rash), due to twisting and warmth.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Venerisatio of the interior parts of the two alburnum (a kind of vessel), results in a restorative effect similar to bloodletting from three veins: Fucus, Basilica, and Cephalic. Since it draws blood from all those fine vessels present within the flesh: and these small veins draw from other larger veins until the pull reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Windicator not to proceed excessively in incisions: because there is a flesh-free area, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction apparatus that is used for evacuation, when applied to the anal hemorrhoids and lower ulcers, produces bleeding.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Windicator to use a large suction device and one made of air; because a strong suction is required in this area, and possibly delicate suction devices might break, leading to incisions during treatment.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The suction devices for the legs reduce their symptoms by causing a clear diminution; as they draw blood from the entire body and bring old pains to the kidneys, uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation and cause thirst, loss of appetite. They stand in place of phlebotomy involving the two saphenous veins and other leg veins.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the improvement of the Windicator for the thigh is akin to the improvement of two Windicators applied to each leg.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position for the Windicator is to place the suction in the first vacuum and apply a moderately heated suction; do not prolong the position of the Windicator but instead place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that fluids come to the site at an equal pace: do not stop the process until you see the area turn red and swell, and a sign of blood appears: then, make incisions, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the arrangement of the body parts.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who have tender flesh, rare and few hairs, it should be incised only once, not more; to prevent the area from becoming infected.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the practitioner of ventous treatment, to extend the incision and go slightly deeper. And regulate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then you should incise it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first incision is made to allow for thinning of the blood and its liquidity. And in the second, it's to thoroughly investigate and meticulously extract thickened blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is extremely feculent (thick), then a third incision should be made in the ventous treatment: so that the final stage can be achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And for the final stage, when we wish to extract blood gradually or in parts, it is sufficient for us to make a single incision.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we intend multiple extractions of blood, then we perform several incisions through the ventous treatment process.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it becomes necessary to perform deep incisions. And an equal point of conclusion for such incisions is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	¶ What is that which must be administered from oils when in the position of Ventosarum, and what should the ventous practitioner beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	Indeed, for skin that is thick, tough, dark, and the pores are tight, one should grease the areas to be treated with opening, soothing, resolving oils. If it's in summer time, then use oil of almond, or oil of vinegar, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from the seeds of cucurbits.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it's in winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or chamomile oil, or sassafras oil: similar preparations are to be used.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is a need for warmth and it is excessive, make it cold: then let the oil be bitter almond oil, or oil from myrrh, or white oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If fever is caused by many porridges, it affects the flesh: then it must be prohibited from oil and those who washed their Venter's areas after food with rose water or with cold water or with warmed water or with water of cucumber or with water of portulaca, and similarly with these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That is, for someone whose blood is filled with much moisture, wash the Venter's areas with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similarly with these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	For those who have excessive affections, wash their Venter's areas with old wine, or with water of Samsu, or decoction of anise, or chamomile, and similarly with these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it must be that Venter washing is done in a bath or in its shadow. Or it should be given after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it must not be that anyone sleeps after Venter washing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the measure that should be taken for regulating Venter sand (an ancient term possibly referring to 'venters' or 'glands') or bloodletting before Venter washing.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	AND after this, you should consider firstly: then if the Venter or bloodletting is choleric and binds to his blood's sharpness and inflammation, then it must receive cooling measures, like the pomegranate's flesh. And also eat endive with vinegar and lettuce, and garlic, and parsley: and similarly with these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And impose his diet on chickens and fowls' flesh stirring activities, as well as cooked food mixed with herbs. Like this for him.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for those who have a cold constitution, they must take syrup from honey, or almond syrup, or an infusion made from the seeds; and they should drink fragrant medium wine that is between old and new. And it should be advised that they consume small quantities of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And impose his diet on chickens and rabbits: and birds such as sparrows, that is, small fowls: and the young of wood pigeons he should eat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the amount of liquid in a person's diet be greater than the amount of food: and certain individuals should take drinks such as carot and salicylic medicine or musk, that is, muscat or allisilite before wind treatment. Before bloodletting, or after it: this will strengthen the main limbs and refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take that in heated liquid.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ On Wind Treatment withoutScarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Wind treatments that are performed without scarification involve placing them over the kidney, spleen, ankle joints, and above the belly button, navel point, kidneys, and buttocks. This is because these body parts do not tolerate scarification on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And there is no concern for these treatments unless there's an attack from the blood within to the body part; as we place Wind treatment over the nipples during the sickness of flow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	We use them to alleviate the cold wind that infiltrates within a limb: as we place Wind treatment over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For indeed it dries out the member, and warms it up, and removes pain because it resolves that wind.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is excess moisture or a stone occurring in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For through its force of attraction perhaps it opens the excess moisture, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	Similarly, it is done when it is placed over the spleen and liver where there is wind to be soothed within both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these winds are administered with water during only sectioning.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And they are sometimes administered with fire as well.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And they are sometimes administered with warm full water in pleuritic illnesses: and this is so that the Winda (or wind) is filled up, and there is a large amount of hot water alone, or water to which herbs suited for this have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of Winda (wind) administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let its aperture's size be two fingers opened wide according to how we have formed it. And the depth of it should be half a palm. And let its width on the side be near the middle, a small hole as large as what enters into itself with the needle: made from air alone, or citrus peel, broad edges, soft, equal, smooth ones such that it doesn't injure the body at its position above it, and there should be a rod in the middle of it made from air or iron where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this wind is made large, larger than we have described, and that other one somewhat smaller, according to the severity of his illness and his age.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Winds for children and weakened individuals are different from those for adults and larger-bodied individuals.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this fumigatory with fire on the member is as follows: light a wick made from linen in an appropriate manner or a small candle from beeswax and place it above the middle rod that is crossed in the middle of the fumigatory. Ensure the fire's heat is focused around the lower part of the fumigatory to prevent the body of the sick person from being burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Next, place it on the member: and let a finger be placed over the hole that I mentioned until when holding the fumigatory. While we are in need of it, remove the finger, allowing vapor to rise over this hole, and immediately the fumigatory will clear.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the flax oil according to its manner and repeatedly use it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of a Ventosa (a type of fumigatory) that is used in pleurisy illness with water, there is no cross rod or hole, and it is not applied unless filled with water and placed solely on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger the Ventosa, the more water it can hold, which makes it better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ Concerning the hanging of Blood sugars.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood sugars are not administered in many cases, except where there is no possible position for fumigators due to their size like the lips, gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare member from the flesh, such as a finger, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality to use them is: using the sponges from the Blood sugar which are in sweet waters, cleanse them of putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be bathed daily both in day and night in sweet water until there is no longer any hunger in them and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be cleansed first with bloodletting, and with emetics.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the diseased part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place something over it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	And when they grow, and fall off, and it becomes possible to induce suction with an emetic at the site, then this is the final stage in treatment: and if not, then cleanse the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then wash it thoroughly with water, rubbing and squeezing it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood extends after the case of Blood sugar, and there is this remaining: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it over it until the remaining thing subsides.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then sprinkle it with ground wheat or gall and similar things from styptics until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on the site halves of boiled bones: and remove them, until the beans adhere to the place, for then blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it must be that if Blood sugar is necessary, when possible, one should change these.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however Blood sugars are prohibited by suspension, then cleanse the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or bind the point at places until something comes out from the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they stick immediately when they sense something coming out of the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish them to fall, sprinkle something from ground aloes, or salt, or ashes over them: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	Part II End.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torsion, and similar issues.
Caput I.	Head 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it deals with the restoration of fractures, and dislocations, accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, my children, that many doctors and the crowd boast about this chapter, and those who have never inspected an old book or read a single word from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, the moderation of knowledge in our land has been deprived.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never profited from it in any truly good way, and I have not acquired what I can only acquire through the length of reading old books and studying above understanding them, until I have extracted knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by adherence, experience, and study over the longevity of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you everything contained in that which is encompassed by my knowledge within this chapter: and beyond what remains from my experience after abbreviating it for you, freeing it from the occupation of elongation, abbreviating it at the end of abbreviation, showing it at the end of declination: and I have shaped it into many forms derived from the forms of instruments used in it, as with addition to declination, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collections are necessary from the existence of bone fractures, from those which need to be provided beforehand before we begin recalling fractured limbs, and various ones, if each one.
Caput II.	Head II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the introduction of this chapter, the main points of discussion and chapters, to which understanding leads at first, the artisan towards the station of their truth: namely, let those who are with you, and ready to learn, know or start learning this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say that when someone experiences a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or any other case, then one must first proceed to perform bloodletting on him and relieve himself, or both at the same time: if there is nothing forbidding this, such as weakness of the body's strength; or it is he who has experienced something from those things that happened to a young person, or an old decrepit person: or it is time for intense heat, or intense cold for a long period.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, cold spices and fowl meats, as well as thin soups: abstain from wine, and fatty meats, and be filled up from foods and any food that fills the blood veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are free from the heat of sweating and do not feel any discharge of pus to the member: then the invalid returns to his first regimen according to his accustomed routine.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When then the broken mouth begins to restore itself, it is necessary that the invalid consume foods rich in nutrients, heavy, large ones which contain thickness. Such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, feet, guts of fowl, eggs, and fresh fish: also thick wine, and similar items.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the healing of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you will know that broken bones in men who are at the start of old age, and decrepit ones, cannot always continue and strengthen according to their nature due to drying out of their members. They only continue and consolidate what is within them from the end of tenderness like those in young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature joins over the broken mouth from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, to which it adheres and tightens itself until it sticks together, and binds together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was initially, until it does not prevent anything from its operations: for this reason, it becomes necessary to place nourishment for the sick food, in which there is weight, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you will know that the species of fractures are various, according to the diversity of the members: because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone: and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone: and similarly all other limbs exist differently among themselves: and I came with the recollection that in his chapter he presented in detail, he distinguished every species of fractures from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are also differentiated among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because there is a curved fracture, and beyond that, stones may occur.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are fractures where stones appear, that is, stones, and additions proceeding from them, as occur in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: there is a fracture with a wound and rupture at the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every species there is skill or an appropriate tool for its restoration, as the recollection will bring to mind separately in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from it, the kind of bone fracture is recognized, which includes its curvature and its height. It becomes visible to your senses, and you can hear it when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no twistiness visible in the place, nor sound upon touch when you are touching the mouth with movement, nor did the inexperienced find great pain; then there is not there fracture, indeed it is possible that there may be a twist or small crack: so one does not need to move it with your hand and total compression, indeed place it under the remedies above which were recalled, after that moment which fits the location: then the constriction is tightened finely.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is curved and divided into two parts, beyond which there may be tears at it, but nonetheless all the part moves away from its own comparison: then you must start from your own time for the correction of it, leveling it before an inflammation hot occurs to him.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	And if an inflammation hot should occur to it, then let him abstain for some days until the inflammation has ceased.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then, level the affected part according to any method that can be found by its gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of him and leveling him is easier than in bone where tears occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it according to how you remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	And if there are tears in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts if there is a hand or leg. Or with your hand if the member is few. Or with two ropes, or with rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be to place the member over an equal place according to its natural figure until when the parts of the broken member are extended. Then try to make those additions with all ingenuity and according to any method possible in their places: and beware according to your strength, that no pain or injury occurs due to your operation on the weak one, nor should you try too hard; instead try according to your strength to apply one of two bones together with its partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you test and touch him with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	And if you see anything different there, correct it, and adjust that by the measure of your power.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of severe stretching and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Indeed, many times this happens due to their operation, resulting in pus-filled hot spots or constriction in the limb: as we have already seen from their numerous operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then attach after equalization and suitable operation, and the tightening of that limb, and peace, and tranquility: and warn the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware not to move himself during his waking hours and his dreams during his turning, shaking, and evacuation, as well as all his movements with his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And make him aware not to place the limb in the position that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is that when he feels pain or injury in the position of his limb, then it is necessary to change its position from that one to another where he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And when dealing with him, make sure his position is equal and straight, so that there won't be any curvature in the limb during its recovery.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the tightening of a broken limb is as I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that limbs fractured vary in their thickness, size, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those that are small among them, like the arm, finger, and knife edge, then it should be a soft, fine bandage.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those among them that are large, such as the thigh and leg, must have a broad, thick wrapping within them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad band connects the large member and constrains it equally from every part, so that it does not penetrate itself into the mark.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, start by placing the appropriate ointment for that on it from an equation, on the soft pad over the site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Next, start to envelop the band over the site of the fracture three times or four times, according to the size of the limb: and hold your hand firmly with the band.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and hold less firmly than you did when constraining the fractured site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then extend yourself with the enveloping at the site of the fracture slightly, and gradually alleviate the constriction until you achieve a large recovery from the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another dressing, and envelop it again over the fractured site in turns.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then proceed with the envelopment to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your procedure be in the constriction of the envelopment and its alleviation, as we described in the first upper envelopment.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the envelopments a soft pad or cloth with which to even out the curvature of the fracture if there is curvature in it; and if not, do not place anything in that area.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then envelop over that other dressing.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then level over these envelopments star-shaped bandages immediately, if there is no inflation or pus at the site, and do not apply a warm compress.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is an inflation or abscess within it, then place over the affected area that which holds the abscess and removes the inflammation, and release it after a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then, when you have treated her in this manner, tie (secure) over it then stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from the middle parts of a reed that is cut, shaved and formed wisely. Alternatively, they may be made from wood used to create sieves, which are made from pine or geraid (which refers to palm fronds), or calingi (a type of material). The width of all stars should match this form and have the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it must be ensured that the star which is placed over her allows for a slightly larger and wider weave than the other stars. And the length of the stars should match whatever size or suitability fits to member from magnitude.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then, bind over the stars with another strip, according to the first tightness of the binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then, bind it from above with threads in an orderly manner, as we have instructed about the binding. And make sure that your binding is tighter than the fracture location: and the more extended it becomes from the breakage point, the less tight should be the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And you must have threads that are medium in thickness and fineness, made from soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I've seen in operations of tying stones, there is a great mistake: because the binding falls outside its quality with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, very fine threads do not fit: because you cannot obtain through the binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it must not be less than a finger's width between one star and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If a sick person is wounded through the extremities after tightening in healthy places: then place under them a soft padding or processed wool until nothing is harmed from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with displacement, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I treat it with reminiscence of the matter in chapter two distinctly.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken member needs to be bound with braces from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is because a large member does not need to have pins inserted into it right away, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of being attacked by cold.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of bandages, which the ancients used to restore, that they apply over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A simplified method of bandaging, commonly used for restoration after a fracture, is suitable for various constitutions, particularly for women and children: because it acts on what is not overcome by heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And the way is to take from the mill powder and the wheat bran which hangs on the walls of the mill during grinding: make it just like that, except筛it with a sieve through the flour: and apply its preparation not thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use this.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of bandaging, restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe: Myrrh, lavender, acacia, wormwood, and mugwort; the juice of all is mixed with three minims of myrrh, and five minims of aloes from each kind, and twenty minims of alethil. All are ground together and mixed with alethil water or with wheat bran if the constitution is weak.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, it is a good compound, healing broken bones quickly and benefiting many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A method of plastering, which also heals fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe for mixture, and measure, and white alum, of each a quarter of myrrh, and an ounce and a half of frankincense. All are ground in large quantities and sifted, then made into a solution with water or starch until it can be applied.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method for applying the plaster in cases of dislocations and bones that have been removed from their place: it alleviates pain associated with them, as well as the tearing and breaking of bones.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Wool is taken, it is made succulent, and it is immersed in vinegar, and cooked in oil: it is placed over the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And indeed, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but it is good for soothing hot pains, and it expels pains specifically.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method for applying the plaster that heals broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of dumb figs and the leaves of wild apple trees: grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The shortened method for applying the plaster during bone fracture healing: and when you wish to resolve the remaining pain.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of almond, and chamomile, and flowers of calendula, and herb flour, all in one part: everything is ground and made into a mixture with wine if there is no heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then mix that with water that has been boiled with coriander or just use water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The method of applying a stronger dressing during healing than this initial one, when a hard scab occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the root of altea, seeds of linseed, balsam, meadow saffron, samson's lousewort, and the flower of violet, as well as chamomile, all in equal parts. Each is finely ground and mixed with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	This entire process is done according to the heat of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that something should be placed over a broken member during its restoration, unless it is made from snail slime and oil: nothing else; he instructed that it should be of medium thickness between the dimensions (grossitude) and fineness (subtility).
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen recommends using things to be placed over a broken member during its restoration, which have the property of dissipating heat, such as myrrh, aloes and frankincense, and similar substances among those we described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of dressing that promotes healing and alleviates injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for the mixture of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair roots (incisors), or bird feathers, and altea, in equal parts. They are ground finely and sifted, then made into a mixture which becomes the dressing.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity required is that which ensures the bandage remains in place. Then, you should observe whether if there is no weak pain or itching, and the broken mouth does not move from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If itching occurs there instead, or an annoying pain, or swelling: then proceed and dissolve it immediately, and remove the dressing from him. And take a soft cloth, or a moistened sea sponge: immerse it in warm water, and wash the area with it until the itching stops and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then cut off the member and let it rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a woolen cloth that has been soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose-scented oil, over it. Secure it with the cloth overnight until you are relieved of the warmth from inflammation, allowing for the relief of the member's swelling and easing of its pain, then remove it.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply the dressing to the wound in a fine manner and use a small plaster. Do not tie it too tightly with your own force initially, nor while using something soft together with it, until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see pus, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and if you no longer need any dressing or compression, then apply the same procedure as you did initially evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we said happens to the member, then do not release it until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed and you see from the solution of the member as it appears to you, according to what we said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh over it: add more than your initial compression in the bandage. Also, add more in the thickening of food for the sick person according to their previous remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the fracture area is now drying out and thinning more than necessary: then you will know that the nutrition is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore immerse it with warm water everywhere where you have immersed it, and let this be done for all three days, and ease the compression moderately.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this procedure, nutrition flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the foolish restorers do with a fracture of a limb by other means, when it does not get restored first as it should and gets restored according to its twistiness, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were straight, they would have said that in their books, and operated on it with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of them there at all, and it would be better if this was not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ On the matter of accidents in the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are various and its figures many; and the causes of it are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is one that occurs due to impact with an instrument: and the impact removes all of the bone up until it reaches the sinus, which is under the bone, just as an axe cuts through wood. And because of this, this type of fracture is called the Axial species of fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a tool hits part of the bone and hits its face, but does not penetrate to its end through cutting: and this type of fracture is called the Kalaan species of fracture, that is, total avulsion.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound from two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture from rubbing or grinding, and the cause of it is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar events.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this kind of fracture is also penetrating, which already approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone; or it's within the surface of the bone. And there is a wound from these two fractures as well, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that occurs within the bone like the thickness of a hair: and it's a small crack, for this reason it is called the Capillary species of fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them is the fracture which happens due to chance or stone打击 and similar ones that cause the plate of bone to enter the insides, and it makes a concavity: as happens with air bellows when they are struck, and part of it goes into the insides.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed quite much happens to the heads of bone cavities as with the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated into parts, and I will mention them with the reminder of that whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures through their identification upon them, and investigation with probes, and removal of putrefied flesh which is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The Capillary species is recognized by this: it appears above the mouth, is scraped away, and greased with a wax preparation: for indeed, the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's condition. Then, if you see through these circumstances signs that indicate a clear manifestation on fear, such as vomiting cholera, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, convulsions, acute fever, ejection of eyes and redness in them, and similar occurrences due to various circumstances - without doubt, they are not healed. And if you see non-fearful circumstances and hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	This means, if you receive a wounded person first who is getting worse: and this happens during the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of bone before the fourteenth day following all circumstances.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer days, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone becomes corrupted from pus, and those accidents that we described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture has already reached the layer touching the brain and is small with an attractive force, then you must proceed to enter the broken and ground-up part as I instruct you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is as though you are cutting off the head of the wound and removing over the mouth according to whatever possible manner for you: and according to the shape of the wounds, and what is light on the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	And if it happens to you during the examination that there is a flow of blood or a warm pus, then oppose it with what needs to be done.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is to fill the space with wadding soaked in wine and rose oil, and to let the wound rest until the pus settles, and be secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then proceed with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method involves entering the mouth with the closed lower teeth: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another lower incisor after spreading them slightly further apart: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer yet another lower incisor even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is to have a variety of lower incisors with you: some will be wider than others and some will be shorter than others. They should have sharp ends and be made of iron or malleable metal. Use them carefully in striking over the lower incisor, so as not to hit the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the mouth is strong and hard, then it is necessary to puncture around its circumference before administering the incisors with the so-called chisels that are not deep: and they are not named in this way unless it is because they do not penetrate the edge of the bone to that which is behind it: therefore, for the end of the chisel being round on what is below its sharp head, similar to a small margin prevents submerging and penetrating through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to receive from these drills a large number, of which each one should correspond to the thickness quantity of bone until there comes before you every drilled piece: whose sharpness in length and shortness amount shall be according to the quantity thickness of that bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	As for the quality of drilling through a fractured bone, it is this: you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place whatever has the quantity of thickness corresponding to all the hole or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors that is between all the hole from the bone: and make that slightly finer than you can on top of that end of thinness, as we said, until you remove the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument prepared for this, like tongs, and fine drills.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must take every caution so that the drill or any of the incisors does not touch anything in the sinus.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	And when you have circumscribed the bone while drilling and separated it from the sinus, if it was continuous with it, and you remove it, you must scrape and make equalize its remaining extremity in the bone with another similar incisors tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thin and finer than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if there remains any part of the old bones and splinters, then take them with ease using what you have from tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with lances and ointments as we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of surgery is easy, exceedingly distant from fear: this said Galen and highly praised himself. And this was his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	Firstly, you must begin by discovering the section of the bone at the location where the fracture is more severe and more obvious. Continue until you have identified that part of the bone, and place the tip of this lens-shaped incisor tool beneath it; this tool has such a shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-like part does not encounter anything soft. Its sharp part pierces into both sides of it longitudinally, as you can see, so that the lens-like part is inserted into the canal, with its acute face encountering the bone in the mouth.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Next, strike the incisor with a small hammer on one side until you can easily penetrate the entire bone, as it turns. And be at ease about the cloth, for there should not occur any events that you fear will happen completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not dumber than men and less familiar with it, and was not asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the cloth in some places, it would penetrate him along with the tip of that lens-shaped incisor tool, and release him easily from it.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is indeed released without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is removed from the bone has its face, and there remain in it roughnesses and subtle scratches: then you must, using fine rasors prepared with various quantities from different tools, eliminate that roughness and remove those scratches. You should be able to apply these more suitably in every location, according to what your operation leads you to do, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it must be that you administer in your ratio, which for the first of roots, the mouth, more broadly than those who shave.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use something finer afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that until you reach the administration of something finer and more subtle among all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	For each remaining narrow crack and slight fracture, it is necessary to administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that cannot be hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and stands above what we wrote and displayed in the larger fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however, when you remove the nodule and then you detect the hole: then it must be that you take a linen cloth according to the quantity of wounds, immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another linen cloth which is doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and rose oil, then place it over the first cloth. And do what can be done easily on top of this so that no scab forms.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer a broad ligament above it: and do not tighten it unless its width can hold the wound only; and let it off with this care after one day or two days, until you are secure from the warmth of the pus.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer afterwards medicines with which there is superfluous dryness, such as the roots of lily, and herb flour, and thuriferal ash, and aristolochia, and similar to these. And do this: make a powder from these medicines that is ground over the wound like the powders.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer onto it every medicine of which the property is that it cleans and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your virtue, that the wound in your treatment becomes clear: let there be no stench of ointment, nor impurities.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let toxins accumulate completely within it: for when toxins accumulate over the brain cloth, they corrupt it and putrefy it itself, and after this incident malice occurs greatly: and now an infection in the head's scalp happens, as it is purified from him, especially when his care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider when such incidents happen to an ill person, as we said, you will know that it is very likely harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, except from the medicine that is put upon him, and it has the virtue of that medicine to make that blackness: then you must take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and linen with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place him over the wound: afterwards care for it with suitable remedies until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ For restoration of the nose when it breaks.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken by both of its upper parts at once, or one of them; because it consists of two bones: since below them is cartilaginous tissue, which does not break and does not happen to him except through friction and tortuosity.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of its nose is broken, then you must insert a few fingers into the nostril opening, and equalize that breakage with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape: this should be done with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, so that through your operation, no pain befalls the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach the finger area, then it must be corrected at the extremity of the radius where thinness occurs.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that: and arrange for its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, you should heat it gently until it is warm.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a linen ligature at the extremity of the nose if the fracture is in one part. Or insert two ligatures if the fracture is in two parts; and place in the ligature such thickness that it fills up the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the old restorers said that they should be dipped in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But this does not seem to me correct; rather it should be dipped into the powder mixed with alum, made with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the ligature until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And at other times a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of the ligature, after a soft cloth has been laid over it: and this causes the broken part of the nose to be held more strongly in place, and prevents the sick person from being hindered by breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, use the linen ligature.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that you have to operate on the nose again while you are working, plaster the nose with camphor, or with a cloth infused in rose oil, or moderately from hyssop water.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If hot pus does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster him with a mixture of saffron flour and powdered thyme mixed with tallow.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft wax over him, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or crumble, then it is necessary to split them over there, and extract them with the instruments that suit them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then heal the cut, and take care of it with that which causes flesh to grow back and harden from suitable plasters, or ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If an ulcer occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to heal it with lime and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	¶ Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its breakage is not accompanied by an ulcer: then observe if there is a break only of its exterior, and it is not broken into two parts, and it is being healed internally. Then knowledge about it becomes easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the break is in the right part of it, you should insert your left index finger into the sick person's mouth: similarly, if the break is in the left jaw, then insert your right hand's index finger. And push with it the hump of the fracture from inside with ease to the exterior using your other hand from the inner part of the bone and make it even along with it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts according to straightness until an evenness can be achieved.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If indeed there has already occurred shaking or fracture in the teeth: then bind them with you hope that what remains will be with threads of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place over the fractured jawbone a chisel.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a double layer of cloth, and place over the cloth a large central piece (of leather) or a piece of equivalent length of the sole skin, in the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to what you have prepared for its binding and fits its application until it is not destroyed. And advise the patient to eat gentle sips while remaining calm and at rest.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that something changes in the figure at some point: then come quickly and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has changed from that, and plaster it with powder of the millstone mixed with urine or with millet flour after you have removed the chisel. And place over the plaster a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While the plaster remains attached to it and does not change the arrangement of the bones, remove it, do not break it until healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is bound several times within three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile an abscess occurs, then apply what we have said many times for its sedation until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, consider it carefully.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If indeed it has separated from the bone, or the wound is large: then carefully consider this so that you may remove those fragments of the wound with what you need for their removal during surgery.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound's opening is narrow, then widen it with a cannula according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have bled sufficiently from them, and nothing remains in them, then if the wound's opening is large, do so. But if not, place over it some of the plasters that suit this, and harden that until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the furca (a tool resembling forceps used in surgery) when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Title VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furca (a surgical tool) is broken in most cases from the anterior part of the humerus, and its fracture occurs according to one of three methods.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or indeed it may break and split into two parts, beyond which bleeding occurs: and this makes its restoration easier.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or if it happens at the site of drilling into bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or in this way, where there is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the procedure in such cases when there is a fracture without a wound is as follows: you should have two attendants present, one of whom holds an assistant tool that follows the broken Furca, and the other extends his neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equally break the fracture with your fingers until its shape is formed as required, and there should be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place under the hinge a small spherical padding of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: extend it and lift up the Furca, and tighten the sphere with your hand until an equal break occurs, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the extremity of the Scapula towards the outside: because it has reached depth, then the patient should lie on his back on his own neck. And place under his shoulder in middle a cushion of medium size, and press the patient's shoulder against below until the mouth of the Scapula which is deep goes up to above. Then correct the fracture and level it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel the scapula moving and causing pain, then it is necessary to place something over it, and extract the part that causes pain with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained within the bone, then use your ingenuity in making an incision with one of the teeth you prepared for this. After placing under the scapula the tool that holds this place: and the tool can be made from wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It assimilates to the cochlea which does not have a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need from it, from the size of the bone and its firmness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	As for its length, however, also according to what is possible for you with respect to the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one of the ends be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the breakage of the skin where you cut when extracting the part that causes pain in the bone is wide, and you secure it with a warm stitch: then join two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the breakage is small, or you fear an abscess will form: then fill the wound with bandages and grains according to the size of the cut in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If an abscess becomes warm, then immerse a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	If there is a narrowing of the bone when it is without wound and without sectioning, it is to put on the mouth a plaster made from mill flour with curd.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft wadding on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its nipple if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Next take a hawser, that is, a rope which the Saracens hold, which should be extremely long; and its width should be one hand or roughly around that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Next place a doubled cloth on the wadding and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Next take an aster from a thin table, which width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Next wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Next wrap the cloth with the aster over the spot where the hawser falls on the fracture and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Next place the hawser on the fracture as is described, and wrap it over his neck, and under its healthy nipple and under its sick nipple: and place it across all parts, and however you see that the constriction holds the fracture to the proper extent: and this thing should not be hidden from you, and whole, so that it is not removed a hawser above the fractured mouth.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	So whenever the ligament softens and you see that the hawser is already moving: then straighten this out, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person on their back, and put under their breast pillow during their sleep with insufficient milk production at night, so that when he/she is lifted, his/her assistant can be removed from beside him/herself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So the clavicle fracture should be treated by lifting the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his/her arm to the neck: and do not loosen the bandage if there is no accidental occurrence from itching or slip until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing, if you have to turn his/her face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and release him, until he recovers and coagulates.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the clavicle fracture is tightened and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in certain individuals in lesser time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Chapter on restoring the Spatula fracture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula is rarely fractured, and if it is, it's at the broad part of the bone: and it doesn't break from that area except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So when it breaks from that place and breaks in the middle of it, and cannot be recognized unless by touch: then according to how the fracture shape is, try to prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And return it over to its natural shape in every way possible using your skill, which is within your capability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area flour mixed with urine and soda ash, and a soft fat, and place above it a dust from a doubled piece of cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it a wide piece of thin table wood according to the size of the spatula in total, or somewhat larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If there is an indentation under the star (instrument) at some locations on certain parts, then equal this indentation with soft wax, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Next, cut above with the Alhammati knife, until it reaches the constriction and the firmness of the star, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And examine the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, tighten it, and adjust the star if it moves from its place; let the unhealthy lie on the healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	Indeed, the spatula is restored within twenty days or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	So when this number has been completed, then release the ligament: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a fragment of bone and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about the fracture of the carpals on immersion in hot water, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the restoration of a fractured Chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of its span, and this is rare.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, however, break and crumble due to the various accidents of its nature.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it breaks its middle section that inclines towards the lower side, and this causes it pain suddenly, difficulty in breathing, and coughing. And perhaps blood is vomited out, and a concavity in the broken bone is revealed, not hidden from sense. The restoration of its condition is when the sick person lies on his back: and place between its spatulas a pad.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the ribs of him/her, and unite the back from two parts or sides with hands: and refine in his/her equation, according to every manner that is possible and fits, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and fat on him/her, and place a layer above that of an oak or ash wood tablet, or of similar thin materials. After you have immersed that in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then refine the act of tying it over the broken bone so that it doesn't move: and proceed with the bandage according to roundness towards the back multiple times, and tighten it to a suitable stricture.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if need be prompts its release due to itching, or corrosion that happens in the area, or pain, or pus: then hurry, and release it, and remove the plaster, and correct whatever happens according to the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster if you see it fitting back: and attach to him/her a constriction until he/she is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ For the restoration of ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Title IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the breaking of ribs does not happen except in the large areas following the back, and from their ends towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen due to friction on them, except for that reason, because they are made of cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	The knowledge of this does not escape perception during the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is performed in this way: equalize the fracture with fingers according to the possible manner, until its shape matches, as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply the plaster, and suture the broken mouth with a needle if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is downwards towards the interior: then it happens to the sick with violent pain and puncture, as the puncture that happens to him who has pleurisy: therefore, because the mouth pierces the membrane, and even this causes difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is a difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have devised many ingenious things in this matter: among them are those who say that you should feed sick people who cause inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflamed, stretched, and pushed outwards by the fracture.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however, detest it, so that not the cause of making a hot blister is made quickly, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let there be a windy thing over the place, then extract it with strength, and this is similar to their reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy thing will attract excesses to the place due to the weakness's disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that is already submerged in hot oil: and put cotton between the ribs until it fills up: so that the binding will be even when you remove it according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person is treated with the therapy of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	And if it constricts the sick person with pain that he does not bear, and pierces the membrane of the wound causing irritation, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary to cut above the place, and expose the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then place on it an instrument that preserves and seizes, whose description has preceded: and enter the mouth with ease, and enter it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then bind the two lips to the wound if it is large with stitches: and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	And if a hot pus bubble should occur in between, then quickly do it and pour in the powdery substance in oil mixed with rose water, and put it over the place. And the sick person will be cured along with that which conforms to the management of the pus.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And also it is covered over the side on which he sleeps, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	§ On the restoration of a fracture of the Spondylial column and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, occasionally the bones of the neck suffer fracture and are rarely subject to abrasion; similarly, even so with the Spondylial bones of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	And when such a thing happens to someone, and you want to know whether they will heal or not, then trust in this.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor constrict them; and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp point, he does not feel that, and does not feel pain in them: then you will know that they are not healing, and there are many postures where it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	And if he moves them, and feels constriction with fingers and a prick inside, then you will know that the neck of the bone is saved, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if a similar thing befalls the Spondylial bones of the back and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet. Then if you see that they are softened and this happens in them as it does in hands: and when he lies on his own back, wind and weakness come without desire: and when he is laid on his belly, weakness comes without desire: and when he is laid on his own back, and desires to move, but cannot: then you will know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, there are no labors in curing it.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing from that happens to him, then the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment that happens from this is like compressing abscesses with hot oil: do so by placing on top of rubbed Spondyle a single drop of rose oil; or when you're hungry, eat an egg.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply that to it several times a day until the abscess settles with hot application. Then apply one place from the bandages that strengthen, dry out, and bind over it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to use it in peace and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part with which he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If during the rubbing of bone spicules occurs, or if anything separates from it already: then it is necessary to separate under the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bind together the two lips of the wound if it's large with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with something that promotes flesh formation from ointments until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last bone is fractured and it's the end of the tail: then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible, and align it again in its second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place on it and remove it; and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On restoration of the Ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do ankle bones break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless a break occurs at the extremities of them: and they split longitudinally, and bend towards the inside: and sickness arises where it happens, and piercing: and the leg that is broken swells.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed, its restoration is to place your hand over it until you are above the fracture according to the shape of its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	And if the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture according to what you prepare from an equation until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	And if the fracture is in its length or has already bent towards the inside, then have the sick person lie on their stomach until you prepare for yourself the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	So when you have equalized it, place plaster on it. Then place a splint of wood or skin over it. And apply the bandage tightly above where you do not fear the change of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equal the concavity of them with what fills it up until he catches it through the bandage according to equality. And instruct the sick person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	And if a warm abscess happens to him, then stop with his extension and restoration until the warm abscess settles. And place what settles over it according to how it has proceeded, then return to restoring him, and apply it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	And if it happens in the soft bone or breaks, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ On the Restoration of Fractures by the Helper.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	This aid is that which is between the elbow and head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it breaks, then its restoration according to one of two ways is when.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which there is one: to take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place, and the patient should sit on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then move his broken arm over the wood until it reaches the end of its socket, with the middle of the wood having a curvature that is attached there.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above him, so that he can stretch his attendant downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should gradually reduce the fracture with their hands until the break returns to its proper place, as required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the second method is that the patient should be made to lie on his neck: and hang his hand from his own neck with a ligature.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two attendants, one of them to hold that which is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold below him, each extending himself towards their respective parts.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tighten with the ligature under the fracture, and with another ligature above it. Each attendant should extend each part towards their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the elbow, then one ligature must be placed under the socket and another under the fracture towards the arm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow: then one must place a ligature on that spot, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make an equal fracture with ease and without effort until the fracture equals what it should according to need, and a good treatment is applied. Then tighten it, if no pus occurs, apply heat.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If pus does occur with the application of heat, then release the tightening until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it wool dipped in vinegar and rose oil until the pus stops: then tighten it; the way of tightening is to place a poultice over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an unraveling from new cloth over the poultice.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then raise the arm above the assistant and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tighten above the assistant's arm so that the arm stands in place of the stars: unless something prevents you from it, do not let anything come to you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something will come to you from the broken bone, then use stars: and it is like placing on the fracture itself a star which is wider and stronger than other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place within the width of all stars, the length of a finger: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the stars the constriction that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is for your tightness to be tighter than the place of the fracture itself.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture extends, the less should the constriction be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the arrangement of stars and constriction as we have said, at the time when you restore the member immediately, then do: and if you fear pus with heat application, then release the constriction and stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the ligament for all three days, so as not to occur at the place of itching, or swelling, or food from being able to come to the member due to the arrangement of the constriction of redundancy.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct that whole thing, as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed it is beyond trust, so that nothing comes from it: then do not cut the ligament unless three days have passed, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hands over his own stomach: and place under assistance a full wadding of equal wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And observe at every hour of the night or day so that the figure of the broken member is not released, or the ligament is not softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the patient's food according to the order we have prescribed, so that the food should be subtle first, until the mouth begins to tighten: then it will be necessary to thicken their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	Indeed, the habit of the assistant and thigh is that they should be tightened for forty days: therefore it will then need to be released and a bath administered, with treatment using ointment which corrects that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture has been foul or contaminated, clean it: then do not cut away from that ligament and stile until the fifty days are completed, and even up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Title XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are named the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One is short, and this one follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and this one is placed under the smaller one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater hammer breaks the larger tile, or it is insufficient: and perhaps they break both at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	So when the smaller hammer breaks the upper one, then its repair is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower hammer breaks it, there is a bad fracture, and its repair is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And that situation is worse, when two bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	So if the bone that is broken is by the smaller hammer above, then it is advisable for the doctor during its repair to apply a gentle and limited extension until it adjusts.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the larger hammer is what is broken: then it must be tightened with a stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the hand shape during its repair and the extended extension over the splint.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And have the thumb of the hand above all fingers higher: and let the joint be below all fingers or the rest: and let the sick person sit square on himself, and let there be a splint in front of him, or directly under him, at height, so that the sick person does not incur unnecessary labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant should extend it similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor adjusts the bone until it is reduced according to the best shape that can be achieved.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are defects in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all fragments into their place by your own force.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If it appears that there is a protruding abscess within it, and you prick the skin, and have no hope of restoring it: then cover it up, and remove it according to the manner we said concerning those previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If it is a fracture accompanied by a wound, I have already addressed this in a separate chapter on that subject, therefore take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	And if a hot abscess should occur at the beginning of your recovery, then apply a cloth bandage made from camellia oil and white wax, making it have an intermediate thickness between being thick and thin. And bind the cloth tightly over it with a fine strap until the abscess subsides. Then remove the camellia wax, and apply the prepared plaster made from ground cornmeal mixed with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints; the splint that should be placed over the fracture itself should be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you will know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether there is a fracture in one bone or in two bones at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the site of the fracture stronger and more firmly, and a little more with the bandage above the fracture, or below it: or place a softer bandage with its firmness slightly matching what was remembered at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that cover the fracture be soft and wetted: and do not let them be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be thread made from linen that is used for binding, intermediate between fine and thick, as we have told you.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And after the passage of days, examine the member and the ligament.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if something happens that requires correction, such as itching in the member: then you should immerse the member in heated water until that itching subsides, and release the member that is not being constrained until it subsides, then apply repeated bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the constriction has already softened and the mouth is now removed, and similar conditions occur, then correct that entirely with your force and re-examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excess tightness, then it must be made slightly softer and allowed to rest for a few days until nutrition reaches the area again. Then tighten it once more.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If it does not happen to the sick person anything of what we said, then it is not necessary for them to be released unless after twenty days, or roughly around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then have the patient's hand suspended over their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let their neck be equal, and guard it against violent movements with their own force.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture heals in thirty days or thirty-two days; and perhaps it will heal in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The entire procedure is according to the principles of composition and the principles of force.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	### Restoration of Fractures: The Hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rarely that a fracture occurs in the wrist or at the joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it doesn't happen to him unless it's been rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When then a fracture occurs at the sole or due to rubbing: then it must be that the sick person sits in the square position: and for him there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then have the attendant extend the broken bones, and the physician shall equalize them until they join well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it must apply a plaster and salve, if no pus occurs hot.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Next, place the herb above according to the size of the area: and you have already enclosed it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however it is a fracture towards below about the stomach of the foot, then make a similar sphere out of cloth: and instruct the patient to bind it over her with her fractured foot: afterwards tie it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the herb be from leather that has softness, so that the leather is applied together with the body of the foot: and tie it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however it is a fracture towards the outside, then it must be done: by putting a herb above and another herb from below on the foot. And let your hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Next, put on the bandage as you would turn the hand: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If it happens that a fracture occurs to one of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it must be adjusted according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Next, bind it with the sole: and if you wish, place a flat straight herb on it, so that the fracture may be treated and not disturbed.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is to other fingers like the middle finger and index finger, or the ear and ring fingers, then it must be adjusted and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all may be bound sequentially: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a flat herb on top of it as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And when considering your rehabilitation, and after this arrangement, apply hot pus: and place against it whatever is needed, when something from that happens, according to the progression of its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of the Hips Fracture.
Caput XV.	Head XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and its sensation is described: because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of this is done in such a way that a ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then, every assistant should extend all the ligaments towards its own part according to equality: and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is close to the root of the hip bone, then have the ligament towards its own part so that the extension goes upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture close to the knee, then have the ligament close to the knee, so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should equally place both bone ends with his hands until he restores it according to the likeness of a natural figure: and join the bones with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply plaster and bandage if no abscess occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then let him rest for several days until the hot pus settles, and then resume your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage of its own kind should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover the fracture with a firm bandage, that is, a bandage: and double it twice or thrice: and let there be excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the thigh until the heel reaches the root of the foot.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and thigh near the knee towards below, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over onto the thigh and hip that protrudes from the remnants (of surgery).
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip at the spot of the fracture claws, and place one claw from them onto the opening of the thigh.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up any gaps between the thigh and hip with soft bandages, so that it balances the tightening.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start from the middle over the site of the fracture with a tight bandage, in three involutions or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much more you stretch with the ligament from the site of the fracture, your bandage will be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then direct towards the two ends of the thread that you introduced between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	So bind with each of them three claws that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread towards below until you reach the stone (calculation or granule) of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with each, also pull the ends of the claws from the other side: so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let the bandage remain over that, so that no corrosion of the member occurs, nor pustule, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	So when the remedy has been applied and whatever happens from there, correct it according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a fragment of bone in the bone that stings: then you must make it equal to what exists, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over it and remove it: and take care with him who precedes memory until he is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this thigh bone fracture is tightened, apart from which additional elements are added to it, as we said in the auxiliary and the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But still, during its restoration in this manner of fracture, it does not cause the sick to limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, apart from what the other leg is applied to, then that one who has it must always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the thigh is tightened for fifty days, either a little more is added or a little less: the whole of this depends on the variety of constitutions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	§ On the restoration of a fracture in the condyle of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the condyle of the knee rarely suffers from fracture but is affected by excessive rubbing.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If however it happens to have a fracture, then it is either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is like a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And place it entirely over that with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of that is such that what was disrupted from its parts to the fingers is equated until it is gathered and joined as much as possible by equality and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Thereafter, apply a plaster made from saffron flour or miller's flour mixed with egg whites; and place an oval piece of metal above it if you need that. Then tighten the bandage conveniently over this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have described in other fractures: such as hot poultice and similar things to them; so that for every incident you oppose with what suits him until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	¶ On the restoration of the thigh fracture.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the thighs consist of two bones; one is large and named after the thigh itself. And the other is finer and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both of these have fractures of the same type as those occurring in two arm bones; and because of this, its restoration is like the restoration of the arm, being one action.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	And if two bones break at the same time, the thigh becomes all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the finer bone breaks, the thigh turns to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the larger bone breaks, you find that it is below; and there are things from them which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and adjustment, and the stringing of stars in accordance with that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it must be that if the thigh bone is broken and has many symptoms, there should be a larger extension and gentler adjustment on your part.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed in the thigh there is something from operation that surpasses the arm: and it occurs that when you adjust the stars and complete your entire operation, then take two strips of wood from pine, which are used in making sun devices that are placed under plates. And they are made of palm spatulas. And choose those among them which have slight thickness and are not made from finer material. And their length should be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then roll over each piece of cloth twice in two involutions according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg at one end, and the other part at the other end: and let there be from the knee down to the lower part of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two ligatures at three places, at each end and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when a constriction is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and to the left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, a crutch made from wood is administered according to the length of the leg, and the leg is placed into it so as to preserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed, you must do that when there is an injury and it is properly fractured.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and attend to it carefully on the last day from suppuration, or inflation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	So if anything of those happens, then oppose it with what needs to be done against it, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Regarding the fracture of bones in the foot and digits.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, the heel does not undergo a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Fractures of the foot bones occur sometimes, and fractures to a lesser extent also happen to digits: and they do not happen to them unless there is rubbing in various positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the foot bones, and you see that those bones rise up over each other against each other, then the invalid should place his foot on a prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on what rises from those bones: afterwards press it, or heel it; and level that until it returns to its own places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and place a pad above it. And put under the foot a thin plate, which should have two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it around the foot to a suitable constriction, after you have enclosed it with bandages and the rest that it requires.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	So, when three days or four have passed for her, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	Then you will find that the bones are properly aligned, or if they are broken, or if they are dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Thus, the operation is as you see it should be.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any of the fingers are broken, then restore them and align them according to what I have told you about restoring fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place on your finger a wedge according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider than that. Next, put under the foot this plate as I told you, and tighten it around the foot to a suitable constriction.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is broken originates from the bones being two, or three, or more, then place on each entire finger a wedge of corresponding size, enveloped in linen: and tighten the plate under the bottom of the foot; and have it standing on one head of the plate outside the front part of the foot, so that it may hold well for retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is for you to remember not to forget to consider all that I have told you about the rest of the broken parts due to accidents which we have mentioned, and match each accident against what needs to be matched.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ Concerning the fracture of a woman's wrist bones and the rod of a man.
Caput XIX.	Title XVII
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the wrist of a woman is broken, then have her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards that part of the back of him slightly, and be held behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife fills the womb of its owner until it fills her; and a sphere is made from this in the womb.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is squeezed, and the back of his/her is gradually raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For this reason, it exits until it forms in front of the entrance of the womb like a sphere, and the broken mouth returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small ball on his/her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore he/she wants to eat, move the womb with ease, then eat: and return him/her according to the manner in which you introduced him/her initially; and go back to his/her first ball.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days, or roughly around that time, for the mouth is indeed restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take the ear syringe, and press over the opening of his/her reed tube, and insert the whole of the syringe into his/her womb.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow through the reed tube with force, until the syringe is inflated inside the womb, as the mouth returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with a paste and stand for some days, according to what we have told you, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the mouth breaks with the help of Pectinis for men or women, then administer in its restoration and his/her own balance as we told you about it in bone Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these minor breaks which rarely occur, especially if there is some study or use involved.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this my book is very much, for the break itself tells you a straight way in many dispositions of his/her restoration and constriction: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's testicle is broken in a virga (a type of reed), take hold of it as if it were the throat of a goose: and insert the rod into him.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over him an inversion from a cloth, and wrap it up, and let it be for three days or approximately those, and if God wills, he will heal.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ On the restoration of fractures in bones when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for the person who encounters a fracture with a wound, especially if it's large, such as in the hip joint or in the auxiliary bones, or similar to those, that you should quickly apply bloodletting: if they tell you about the conditions of bloodletting, as we have previously instructed.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is bleeding blood, then you must quickly proceed with its amputation, such that you coat it with a powdered mixture of ashes: if there isn't another option available to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin the restoration of the fracture on that same day: and do not delay this task if no abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however an abscess forms hot, then postpone the restoration of that until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not come near him on the third and fourth days either, for you will cause him to suffer harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is protruding above the skin: then it must be that you reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and a slight stretching.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however no preparation for its extension and equalization is made with your hands: then reduce it with this tool.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the tool is made from iron, whose length is the amount of seven fingers or eight: and its width matches the size of wounds.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason, it is necessary for the physician to obtain from them three things, or four according to the quantity he needs for that in every species of fracture from treatment.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be thinness in it, so that it does not double upon itself at the time of compression during the operation hour: and let its ends be sharp, which should have a border at their own ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it extend upwards from the middle towards thickness until downwards.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp curved end of its side on the tip of the projecting part of the bone. And drive it along with it one by one until when the bone returns and becomes equal according to some equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of the broken side is thin and does not accept that tool properly during insertion, then it is necessary to penetrate that part of the bone until the tool has control.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	However, if you cannot reduce them with what we have described completely, then cut into it with the tool that suits it as we said in the incisors: or saw it with any possible way of a single saw.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then grind that which remains in the bone from roughness and fine cortexes.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore, when the bone is reduced, and after reducing it, a strong pain is found to be hurting, then you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great relief to the sick, when your restoration is completed for the bone that you do.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in tincture of wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place wax over the wound, nor anything that contains oil: so as to prevent occurrence of putrefaction and decay within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer astelas at the time of your post-meal digestion for bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And expose the detected wound: so that you may make an opening with your forceps according to the size of the wounds.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware, do not tighten the wound with fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times, stupid doctors have done this: and they caused death or decay or putrefaction to occur upon their sick patients, that is, disease.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And make your compression soft, gentle, different from the compresses of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or if it's a large wound and you're worried about some bad events we told you about, and you find pain in that hanging spot: then you should not place wax over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And have them progressions from hard cloths at the spot of the wax, and compress it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when the wound begins to heal after one day or two days, and you see that pus is beginning to form within it: then remove the cloth that was placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer liquorice and smear with the ointments that are customary for us to use when treating wounds: such as the tetrapharmaceutical ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is suitable for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine a wound every day in the morning and wait until it is solidified, and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it must be prepared in such a way for the member that the pus can flow out of it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	And if many days pass and the wound does not harden or discharge pus from it, then you will know that there are small bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound when you touch it.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	And once these soft parts are separated from them, remove those and extract them themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what of them are not separated and penetrate the member, causing pain to occur, try to incise them and remove them in every way possible that you can.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	And if the wound festers or discharges pus, that is, it becomes inflamed or exhibits another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it must be treated with each one according to what suits him from treatment as explained in the chapter related to its case.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this point onward, my words must stand and you should adopt the present understanding when a bone breaks and protrudes over the member, as in the case of the hipbone and its auxiliary parts, or similar situations with large bones. You should not mistake it for an injury; indeed, many times such occurrences lead to death. Instead, abandon it until it becomes gangrenous.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	So then take care of the wound if you see it needs attention: and if not, abandon it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Section on the treatment of Nodular Abscess in the case of fracture.
Caput XXI.	Title XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this happens, namely the examination in search of healing of fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Mainly, which is akin to sutures: and it is torn from that figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the member from its natural act of operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	So consider then, if the nodule is recent: administer medicines that promote coagulation in it, such as aloes, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, take from these some or all of them, and mix them with alcoholic wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the nodule wrapped in a poultice, and bind them tightly to it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the bandage, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another one, until the nodule is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a sheet of lead slightly off center.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Indeed, lead has the property of removing whatever is feared from members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodule has already converted into a stone, is bound up tight, and urgency demands its removal: then apply to it from above of that part, and shave off the protruding excess: or cut it with some razors until it's removed; and attend to it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When restoration occurs after this delicate issue remains in the member, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Title XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of bone is restored and afterwards a delicate, weak member remains, then this does not happen without many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of these, one is, the multitude of solutions for ligating and tying ligaments, not according to what should be done: either due to the excess tightness of the ligament ties, until nutrition is prevented from flowing to the member; or due to the excess amount of ointment being applied when it shouldn't: or due to the scarcity of blood in the body of the weak and their debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for that is to feed the sick person and make its body tender, until blood multiplies within it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and mirth upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place ash on the member: so that it attracts much nutrition to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply its ointment with warm water until the nutrition flows and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ On the care of fractured bones when they are being restored.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member, already restored after its healing, still exhibits the twist and elevation of a fractured bone, or the formation of a node, due to this condition. The body heals in this way, but does not prevent the member from performing its natural function. In such cases, one should not heed the advice of those who believe that breaking the bone again is necessary.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And indeed, many foolish physicians and restorers have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this kind of operation is very reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, indeed it can be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limpness and node are recent: then it should be treated with warm water into which have been boiled softening herbs such as the leaves of rue, and its root, and red clover, and similar remedies.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a poultice be made for him with a softifying plaster, such as one made of hydocyanic acid.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or the mucus of the root of the treacle plant is taken and mixed with chicken fat or safflower oil: and it is used as a poultice.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or the fat of fatty figs is used, and it is ground with bird clay or other things they call them among medicines that reduce swelling.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is dissolved with regular, old, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And motion of the member should be given to every part at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however, the curvature has already come and made itself strong and turned into a stone, and there is a need for treatment with iron: then it must be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone should be dissolved continuously. Then that which exceeds from the knot or the bone must be removed by fine knives. And ease should be provided in this matter with concern and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ On discussing dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the departure of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, movement is prohibited to its own position, and the shape of the member is disturbed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to happen over the weak pains and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, it is necessary to hasten its restoration: for it does not completely escape at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if the delay continues, the place gets settled and perhaps with it, the return of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For this reason, it is not necessary for them to move nor be extended during the time of their castration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes cramps and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	However, when this happens, you should proceed with the bloodletting for the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it go until the pustule rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is treated with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the entire member is treated where its mention has returned to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the sections on dislocations, even according to what precedes in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Section: Care of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Dislocations of the two jaws occur rarely, not often.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the temporal bones occurs according to one method.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or indeed they move away from their places by a slight movement and soften slightly.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are completely dislocated until they soften to the chest part, until saliva is produced for the sick person and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is enclosed with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	However, when her dislocation is slight, it returns in various postures by herself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete and integral: then it should be necessary to administer its reduction quickly, without being delayed completely: and it must have someone hold the sick's head. And the doctor inserts his finger of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between the sick's mouth, if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If the dislocation is between two parts, then let him introduce both his thumbs at once.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the rest of his fingers remain outside to aid.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to cleanse and adjust their jaws, so they can eat anywhere.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should align the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved: then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction becomes easier. Do not completely avoid any reduction at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and align properly, and the mouth of the patient closes without softening: then place pieces of linen cloths above them with a candle made from wax: and oil that has been infused.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then, it should be bound with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on their back: and have their head standing between two pieces of linen, so they don't move it to the right or left. Nor should they try, or be made to chew anything: instead, there should be a soft liquid food for them until when the pains subside and the jaw has healed. Then they can eat whatever they want, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	And do not engage in operations on their mouth during strain, drinking, and shaking, until the jaw has healed and they are cured.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws becomes difficult and they are dislocated at some point in time, not returning to their places: then many times fever and continuous pain occur. And perhaps the patient's stomach is relieved, or perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see this: then you will know that it is a loss, and many times that person dies who encounters this within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocations in the Furca and Elbow Extremity.
Caput XXVI.	Title Twenty-Six
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The Furca (or collarbone) is not dislocated from its internal side because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it can sometimes be dislocated externally, and this is indicated by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And the restoration process involves having the patient lie down on their back and stretch out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, apply strong pressure with your hand to squeeze the area, as it will return to its proper position.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Next, place a poultice and ointment on the area and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	As for the remaining parts of his/her elbow joint that follow the elbow and continue with it, they do not get dislocated except occasionally.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated at some point, then you should reduce and level it according to what we have said and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a poultice and ointment over it, and bind it tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to maintain calmness and rest until they recover.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the elbow extremity is reduced even when it's also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocations in the Shoulder (Humerus).
Caput XXVII.	Title Twenty-Seven
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder bone (Humerus) can only be dislocated in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One case is where it will be dislocated towards the scrotum downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second case is where it will be dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, due to the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed, it is largely dislocated and exits towards the scrotum: especially in those with little flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it leaves them quickly and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those with much flesh, it is contrary to that, namely, because it leaves with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people due to impact or incidents, and the humerus gets fractured after heat application, and this is thought so because it was already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you should experience that until you have confidence in it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	Dislocation is recognized when it's towards the scrotum downwards: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	You will find the manifest difference among them, and you discover a concavity in the head of the humerus. You touch it near the scrotum like it is hollow: and the sick person cannot move his hand to his ear, nor can he move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you find a clear touch, which is not concealed.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, for this type of dislocation, there is a simple reduction when it has recently occurred or involves an infant.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction involves having the attendant raise their hand to higher positions.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his prominence and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place: and have the attendant raise their hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it downwards, for he will return quickly by himself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however he does not return through what we said, and it has been several days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary for the sick person to bathe in warm water, and an ointment should be administered which softens and soothes, like when the roots of high plants, and fennel, and the milk vetch are boiled in water, and then given.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person is laid down on their back: and under his prominence place a sphere and wool, which should be equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere and lifts up the head of the shoulder with strength, and attracts the sick person's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant holds the head of the sick person so it doesn't move downwards; for he will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if needed, reduce him according to this manner: and it must be that you make the present man long for the sick one, stand at the side part, and insert his shoulder under the prominence of the sick person: and lift his prominence upwards until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant pulls the sick person's hand downwards towards their lower belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is of lesser weight: then it must be that something else is suspended with him, in order to burden him; for the return of dislocation happens immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and there is a way where wood is fixed in the ground with its head being rounded shape, like the handle of a mortar, so that it isn't bulky nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place under the patient after they have placed fabric underneath the head of a piece of wood. And let the patient stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand to the lower parts from one side, and extend his body from the other part with strength: for the connection returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If reducing him becomes difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and take a piece of wood whose length is the measurement of two arms, and its width is the measurement of four fingers, and its thickness is the measurement of two fingers: let it have a round head, so that his exit can be inserted deeply into the socket, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, apply soft cloths over the round head, so as not to harm the fragile wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the patient under the socket, so that the hand or arm extends over the wood until the lower parts: and tie the wood over the support and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the ladder step by width, and extend the hand to the lower parts, and release the remaining body from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The connection indeed happens immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	And when his exit has been inserted according to whatever possible method: then it must be that you place under the socket a sphere of equal amount made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from mill meal mixed with myrrh and egg white over the whole shoulder as it has been described above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind it around the nipple with a suitable constriction: and the bandage is laid over the plaster from above. And attach his hand to his neck, and let him go, without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it should be that only little food is placed for the sick person until the member gets stronger: because this leads faster to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then, starting from seven days or five days later, he should be moved around with activity.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	So if it hardens and does not soften, then he is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If however the joint is dislocated multiple times due to moisture affecting him or due to some other cause: then it should be treated with a cautery in that area having three holes, as explained in the chapter about the cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done completely, and the bandage is released after seven days, and the joint does not reconfirm, and the plaster and constriction are reapplied multiple times without hardening, and it cannot be lifted above: then you will know that the nerves attached to the shoulder blade have been cut, stretched or softened. And you will know that the joint will never harden in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipples or backwards reduction, it is performed with a push and extension using hands until it returns. Then, further tightening and care are applied to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there is a heaviness in the limb and slowness of its movement, then the sick person should use hot baths repeatedly until that heaviness subsides and returns to their natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Title XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty and similarly it returns with difficulty. And indeed, it can be dislocated towards all directions, especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it appears under view and under touch, according to whatever figure it gets dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, this is made clear to you clearly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint has sunken and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch with its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must approach and immediately reduce the dislocation before it causes an abscess hot.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it causes an abscess hot, the reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it may not be completely healed, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations and more severe pain accompanies them: and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when possible among those that can be reduced is this: to extend his hand with both hands and have his arm open, and the doctor's hands are above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with the tips of his own fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or otherwise the dislocation is towards the front: then return like this, so as to bend his hand with his own, until he hits the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong extension, very strongly: it is that two attendants extend their arms. And they hold him too, so he doesn't move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rolled back until the folded cloth or broad ligament covers the entire part that has been enclosed over his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches his own suture with his hand, he should anoint it with oil, so that this among them which aids in facilitating and smoothness of the suture is done.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the stitches with a vigorous impulse until they return.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reducing it, one must place over it a plaster where there is firmness and drying with an ash, and the bandage should be tightened to a proper tightness.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm hang from the neck of the invalid, and rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then loosen it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If thus the suture is solid in its place, then release the ligature from it and set her.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the suture is not well tightened, then apply more plaster and ligature, and let her rest for several days until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If indeed weight happens to him after the reduction of the suture and its setting is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression until it heals, or place over the suture an inflamed hip, that is, a large navel.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and she is released to rest day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove her, and immerse him in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	And when he sweats, then rub the suture with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply to her one, and then the second, and the third with entry into the bath until she eases.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if it is a boil, place upon it a paste of dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind it over.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this periodically.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it indeed softens and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Section on the treatment of dislocations by Al-Mahassan.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahassan's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the upper arm and the forearm.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast to other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be present during the reduction of this dislocation when it occurs, before the place becomes fixed: or a hot pustule occurs.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is that you make Mahassan's weak hand rest on a table and have an assistant extend his hand. And the doctor places his hand over the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it must be considered if the hand has already receded to the abdomen: then the patient places the back of his own hand on the table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation proceeds towards the back of the hand, then its position is inside on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand is placed on the table so that the doctor's hand falls over the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with the plaster that causes pustulation: and let go of it, do not repeat this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate this, nor can you apply it during its reduction, after passing over the days for him, but nevertheless the joint remains according to its twist: and it does not harm the sick in any way, except that the hand softens, and it cannot bind anything: then you will know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no skill involved except for tightening it with a cautery near its case.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that does not amount to anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So when Almahassem no longer returns, then put on him the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be tightened and released for five days: afterwards it should be opened and released, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If his movements are restricted and something of heaviness occurs there: then soften her with water heated, and with friction occasionally, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Section on the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated throughout its length, or from the end of it to the back of the palm or belly, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and let it off for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him, and extend him, until on that day he equals the straight one.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	So when it is night, bind him according to the said instruction: and do not cease to release him during the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for a few days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if a finger is dislocated towards the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spinal vertebrae of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for this, because death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the weakness of the sick person escapes without his will, and he cannot hold it; and from time to time some part of his body softens from him, or both of his legs, or both of his arms, or one of them: or a spinal vertebra is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed, it is often moved because the removal of those parts happens in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the back, is named Humpiness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, the treatment for this is that you should consider if Humpiness occurs during childhood: then there is no cure for it, and indeed, recovery from it does not occur entirely.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	As for that which happens due to accident, impact, or similar incidents, the old ones have already spoken about treatments and lengthy treatment methods.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which much does not return with beneficial outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed abbreviated it from that which somewhat excuses a great deal of its proximity to my intention: and the explanation I made in exposing it, and fashioned its tool differently than how they showed it and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore that regarding humpiness which occurs from the back part, there is no remedy nor recovery from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And attention is not paid to them unless the one which happens in the back properly, as I narrate. And it is that, for the patient to be extended over his own face on an equal platform near the wall: and a damp covering should be spread under him so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood should be fixed in the ground in the trench, at the end of the platform near his head: and another piece of wood about his feet at the other end of the platform: and the attendant should hold the pieces of wood, ensuring it is not firmly planted in the trench.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other attendant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then cover the patient's head, and bind his forehead loosely but firmly. Extend the end of the ligature towards the piece of wood near his head, and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligature above his hips, and above the knees, near the stones.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligatures together, and bind them to the other piece of wood which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants should stretch out each ligature to its corresponding piece of wood and ensure that neither of the two pieces of wood are removed from their positions where they are fixed. However, they must not be firmly fixed as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his hands on the Spondylus (the spinal column) with strength until he returns or places a table over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then attach his feet to the table, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however, he does not return through this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And dig in the wall as we said is near the patient, for the place where the end of the table will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place a medium-sized table over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tighten it well until the vertebrae are bound together, and then return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Next, if you are a surgeon, operate with the return of what is hidden with your hand: and it is that you fix two pieces of wood at the back end of the sick person's head, whose length will be the span of one arm: and at the head of him also at the rear end of the bed, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be what is between each piece of wood being one hand span: and now a hole has been made at every place, through which the thread runs: and all the pieces of wood are firmly set into the ground so that they cannot move in any way.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round piece of wood: and there is a thread that revolves through the ligament in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, into which wood is fixed, whose length together with what revolves is one hand span: and similarly in both other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Next, tighten the ligaments which you tightened in the sick person's chest: and the ligaments which you tightened in their legs are in the thread that is at their feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by each thread a servant who will twist their hand with the rod through which the thread revolves: and the doctor adjusts the vertebrae as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the thread that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	And after the vertebrae return and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary to apply dry plaster mixed with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the sponge.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a star-shaped piece cut from a board, whose width should be three fingers or roughly that size.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should equal the quantity that fills the place of gibbosity, and over the part of healthy spinous processes.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the invalid uses fine nourishment until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains a certain elevation in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that they be administered medicines which soften and alleviate, with the application of the board we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now the lead sheet is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there is an elevation at the very end of the vertebral column: and it is thought that through this dislocation, and this is the mouth that has already emerged.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it should not happen that this assumption is made with her regarding this medicine: perhaps she might indeed result in death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of an injured ankle joint.
Caput XXXII.	Title XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the jointing of the ankle and the jointing of the shoulder happens only with dislocation, not with any other injuries that involve removal or concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the joint of the ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which means that it is because it can be dislocated at the front and at the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And mostly it is dislocated towards the inside: and only slightly towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for dislocation of its thigh is: because when you join the weak with the strong leg, it goes further; and his knee is higher than that of a healthy person, and the sick one cannot bend his foot near the groin. And there is a place following the groin, which follows the heat, due to the fact that the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign for him who suffers from dislocation of external parts is that his accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign for him who suffers from dislocation of the anterior parts is that his healthy leg expands according to the complement: but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee. And if he tries to walk, he cannot do so beyond this point ahead: and he retains his urine, and he gets heat on his groin, and during walking there is a heel strike of his foot above the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign for him who suffers from dislocation of posterior parts is that he will not expand his knee and cannot bend it before his groin bends: and his other leg is also shorter. And his groin becomes soft, and the head of his thigh bone is at the level of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is as follows: you should consider the situation when the dislocation is old and has already occurred.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction and it remains according to its own position, there is no treatment at all for that.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary for him to undergo this reduction completely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case, for the one whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then proceed as needed to apply a traction force and extend it towards both inside and outside. And move her left and right as well. Perhaps she will return, and no further treatment will be necessary.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this method does not return the limb, then you must prepare a strong assistant and have him extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament that is tied above his knee on his leg. And another assistant should extend his hand from above, so as to insert his hands under his nails.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Next, tie with a soft ligament at the base of the hip joint and hold the end of the other's ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the front part of the groin to the pubic area, or from the back towards the dorsal region.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extensions serve together until the patient is lifted up with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is the common form of the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for every kind it is necessary that I say about self-treatment which I will tell.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, in the self-reduction when the dislocation is towards the inside, it must be that the patient reclines on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the ligament over the base of the hip joint, at the point that is between the head of the femur and below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin area to the higher part of the body, towards the pubic region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong assistant should take hold of his arms and reduce the thick place of the diseased thigh, extending it outwardly with a vigorous movement.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the easier of the other methods of treatment by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however, the injured party neglects you and refuses to follow your instructions at the outset concerning this type of treatment completely: then it is necessary that two weak limbs be bound together with a strong ligament, a softer one, over two heels, and over two knees; and each should have a length proportional to its own quantity by four fingers: and let the injured limb be extended further than the other by a measure of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the injured person be suspended above a wooden post, which will be set up in the house: and let its length from the ground be equal to the span of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct the strong youth to protect the thigh head. And have him suspended together with the injured person by another: and let the other youth push, guarding the thigh firmly, for the connection returns to its place at speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	When returning the person to their normal position, when there is a dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the injured party lie on a platform, as we explained in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over his weak limb and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then place two pieces of wood, one by his feet, and the other by his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then place an added piece of wood in the middle of the foot, well fixed: over which wet cloths should be laid so as not to harm the injured person: and let the wood be between his thighs so that it does not pull down towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then each attendant extends to their own part and the doctor equates the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys in return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place her on the table and press her evenly as we said in the case of humps.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it must be that the sick person lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is anterior, then it must be that the physician quickly extends the sick leg: and he should follow this same instruction on a table: and the doctor places his right hand's palm on the groin of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then, with the other hand, he restrains him and, while doing so, puts him in an extended position towards the inferior side up to the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is posterior: then it should not be that the sick person lies down towards the inferior side and stands above the ground; rather, he should lie on a hard surface, just as it would also be necessary if his entire limb was displaced externally according to what we said about him lying on two sides of his trunk. He lies facing upwards with the ligaments stretched out: as I explained previously.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it should be that compression is applied with a table even on the place from which the joint emerges, after completing the reduction according to what is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its restoration should not be hidden from you: and that is, to extend both legs of the sick person. And when you see them equal, and the sick person grips his leg and expands it without strain; then you will know that the limb has returned, according to what is required. Then join the two hips together, and apply a plaster, and tighten with bandages, that is, rolls: in such a way that not even the entire limb moves towards any part of the body, and the sick person should remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then release the ligament and plaster, and compare the legs with each other. Then, if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation has been set firmly. Therefore, allow the sick person to walk around.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening: then return, and cover that with the plaster, and bind it according to your first tightening: and let go even for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve that and make it linger in walking over both for several days until it strengthens well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee joint is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It can be dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and downwards, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not get dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of its dislocation is that you will instruct the sick person to apply their shinbone to their thigh bone.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere with the thigh: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all forms of dislocation of its knee is to make you sit upright the sick person, so that if he can already extend his shinbone over it, and adheres your back to their face: and place their foot between yours.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then have the knee of its adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm, both sides of the knee in strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another servant will extend their foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	The sign of recovery is that the shinbone will adhere with the thigh bone gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it and have the shinbone adhere to the thigh bone.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with stitches for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then release them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the invalid should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses to be reduced, then administer a strong elongation with bands whose preparation was described earlier in the treatment of ankylosis, until it heals.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Section on the treatment of calcaneal dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus sometimes undergoes a small displacement and at other times a complete dislocation occurs.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation can occur either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, moving towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for the displacement is easy to restore: and it consists in extending it with ease using one's hands until it returns to its original position.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In treating it when it is completely dislocated, you should have the invalid sit upright and have a strong attendant hold him firmly at the posterior part of his back, right in the middle.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold his foot with your right hand from the upper part of his foot and from the heel area with your left hand.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And then use both hands of your left side.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand and push the foot's arch towards the shinbone with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have instructed.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh for a third of its length, and you pull out the stone.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns after one or two thirds of this manner, and you see the foot level, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it: because he himself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is prevented from being reduced with what we have narrated: then make the sick man lie on his back on the ground, and fix a stake deeply into the firm earth so that it falls between his hips: and you have covered him already with a cloth, in order not to harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant grasp his hip: afterwards let the attendant stretch the other leg, or with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied over the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every attendant stretch against the extension of his own: and let the stake stand between the two hips of the sick person holding him, so that his body is not drawn down towards the lower part at extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor will equate the dislocation with his hands, and the attendant will hold the healthy thigh towards the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns and it is made clear to you its return state: then place the plaster and paste, and bind that firmly with ligaments, and tie the foot with a ligament to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you either suspect or feel the nerves, which are above the heel bone behind, so that there isn't a band over them and harm them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release him for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the band tightens up, tighten it again: then release him on the third or fourth day: and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If it is intended to walk before that distance, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not break over itself, and be injured, and not receive treatment after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If an ulcerated sore occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer the thing in his sedation which precedes our narrative in another place from treatment and ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	¶ On Dislocations of the Foot's Fingers, and Care Thereof.
Caput XXXV.	Title XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It must be that which is dislocated from them with a few equalizations without much effort: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain joints of the heel: then it must have the sick person sit with their foot on an equal place on the ground, or on a table: and standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand up, and place your foot upon what protrudes out from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press the shoe against your foot with force until it returns to its original position and you realize that it is now equalised, and there no longer appears a prominence in place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a table which will hold the entire foot, and has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind him with a binding appropriate for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release him, and make him rest from walking for many days until he is bound and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ On the various forms of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Title XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like that happens and you attempt to treat it and restore the injured person, it often leads to death. Therefore, unless one is skilled in medicine with long use, merciful, pious, cautious, not daring or presumptuous, it should not assume this kind of treatment without careful consideration. Instead, they should use remedies that calm hot ulcers only from the beginning and allow the sick person to be judged by divine wisdom for a long time.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you have ideas, or hope for salvation from destruction with a degree of relief from sickness, and where there appears something hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before the pus becomes hot.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns, as we desire, then administer a treatment that calms the pus: and care for the wound with what is appropriate to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	And if there is dislocation with fracture and happens in the bone of the distal part separated, then try their removal, and do what we said about simple illnesses from what precedes in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your virtue, and protect yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what my prediction has been to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and lasts longer for the glory of you, and brings more safety to your body among them at your time.
