Chapter seventy on the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite occurs in men in two types.
One of them is that it appears below the perineum or in the scrotum skin between the testicles, a shape as if it were a woman's vulva with hair.
And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum skin.
As for in women, it is of one type.
And it is above the vulva on the pubis like the male testicles, absolutely small, protruding outwards, one of them as if it were the male penis, and the two are like the testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, the two types of men and the one type of women, it is necessary to cut off those excess flesh until its trace disappears.
Then you treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals.
As for the second type of men, from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum skin, there is no action in it, nor any healing from it at all.
