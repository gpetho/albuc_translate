 CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT.
On the extraction of a fish-bone or anything else that sticks in the throat.
 There often sticks in the throat a bone or fish-bone or something else.
After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.
But when it is not visible to you, and lies hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food in his stomach is digested, for often the object comes out with vomiting.
Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.
Do this a number of times; for often the sharp body or bone will stick to the sponge and will come out.
If it does not come out by the methods described, in this case employ an instrument made of lead, thus.
 It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity.
The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused.
And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body.
Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.
