of the stone in women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it does happen sometimes, the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited for three reasons: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a knowledgeable woman skilled in this practice; and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is located deeper than the stone in a man, for which it is necessary to make a deeper cut, and there is great risk. And if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a very knowledgeable midwife, and one hardly finds them, and if you do not find one, at least look for a discreet and skilled physician; and present to him a very wise matron experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her regarding the examination for the stone; and look carefully to see if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone; and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct the patient to insert her finger into her vagina, and search, and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder down until it comes to the groin; then cut down onto the stone in the groin opposite the middle of the vulva, where the muscle is softest, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move your finger from above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then insert the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones: that is to say, small and large, and rough and smooth, long and round, and some that have branches.
know the symptoms to understand the outcome.
And if the bleeding overcomes you, apply ground vitriol to the area, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding has stopped; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about for the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work; and if the bleeding overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, then apply the powder to the site and compress it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, because perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the place festers, return to your work, until the stone is out.
