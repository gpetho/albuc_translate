CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.	Chapter 17.	0.65278906
Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	Sometimes, in certain people's eyes, a reddish flesh grows or accumulates until it covers the pupil or approaches, or presses upon the eyelids, and it may even turn the eyelids outward; and it resembles the pomegranate flower.	0.896808
You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps.	And the procedure for this is also for the patient to place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or fingers.	0.8111552
Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation. Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	Then cut into the flesh at first, until it is fully removed with the scalpel. And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and make your incision, either with the spatumili, as we described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors, with which asebel is gathered, as will be explained in the following chapter.	0.8603678
And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	When your incision is complete and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or sprinkle it with red powder, or similar corrosive medicines; and place a cotton pad over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot swelling.	0.83971405
If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour.	If anything remains of the alguardenici, and warm blood overpowers you, and you fear a hot swelling, then leave the eye, and treat it with what calms the swelling.	0.68880713
Thereafter return to your operation till cured.	Then repeat the procedure on it until it is healed.	0.78881425
So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	And do likewise with any additional flesh that grows in the eye of this kind.	0.68175244
But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	However, it is necessary that you avoid treatment of any weak eye by natural or incidental means when operating with a blade: and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part is able to withstand that procedure.	0.7762886
