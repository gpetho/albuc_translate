Chapter thirty-two on the spreading of molars that grow on top of others.	CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO. On the sawing-down of teeth growing on top of others.	0.7874419
If the molars grow in a way other than their natural course, they make the face ugly.	When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves.	0.46312195
And especially if this happens in women and slaves, then you should look, and if the molar has grown behind another molar and it is not possible to spread it or file it, then extract it.	So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it.	0.6507303
And if it is attached to another molar, then cut it with this instrument which is pictured here:	But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind.	0.6818504
And it resembles a small beak. And let it be of Indian steel, very sharp at the tip.	It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end.	0.7753452
And your cutting of it should be over many days, due to the hardness of the tooth. And so that you do not loosen other teeth.	You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed.	0.834659
then file it with a file of Indian steel which has this form:	If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	0.58212596
It should all be from India, and its point should be very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made.	It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles.	0.8137033
File the tooth with it little by little over many days, gently, so that you do not shake the tooth and it falls out. Then smooth it afterwards and scrape it with some scrapers.	You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	0.88125294
And if a tooth has been broken and it bothers the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of the break disappears, and it becomes even and smooth, and does not harm the tongue, nor does it spoil speech.	If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.	0.84075046
