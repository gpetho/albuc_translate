the treatment of chancre by cautery
When a chancre comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.  And yet the wise said that one should make a cautery also in the middle of the chancre; and yet this does not seem good to me, because I fear it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen this happen sometimes; and a more proper thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circule", as we have said in many cauteries.
