O you, very dear sons, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, together with its fulfillment, and I have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it has come to me in a vision that I complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery.
And because the work of hands is strong in our region and is foreign in every way, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it strong except for the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have moved. And from this has come error and vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation. and I will come together with the shapes of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is estranged. And whoever undertakes this must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their shapes and their junctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and of the moving and resting veins, and of the place of their exit.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little. and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things, let them beware lest they fall into error and kill men.
Thus, I have seen many of those who undertake this science abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who opened an abscess of scrofulous lumps on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; whereupon so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another man who extracted a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; he took away a piece of the bladder with it, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the disposition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another man who treated a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the ignorant physician held the fracture over the wound with strong bandages, and did not leave the wound any slack, and left it like that for a while;
and he commanded that he not loosen it at all;
and remained like that until the leg was completely swollen, and the foot, and it came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hurried to come and loosen the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another sore that burst its festering abscess, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that all the corrupted material can be removed.
And for this, good son, you must know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work in which there is danger in various situations;
and I will show in each place in this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be careful so that foolish onlookers cannot speak ill of you.
So take your tools cautiously, and undertake your patients gently and firmly, and use the best way so that through the grace of God you come to safety and be praised;
and leave the dreadful sicknesses of grievous illness;
and remove your tools from those that make you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness, unless you are called a fool.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is on cauteries of fire and cauteries of acute medicine, and the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and the preparations of the cautery iron, and of everything necessary for the work.
The second chapter is on cutting and piercing, and on cupping and wounds, and on the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I describe the quality of the aid and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of aid and harm are the longest speech and most subtle science and the secret is hidden.
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear length.
I say that cautery aids universally all complexions where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion together with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help; and the others said the opposite: that cautery is of no value for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is so hot, and it should not be used to treat a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness;
and the one who said the opposite said that cautery is of great help for hot and dry illnesses that come upon the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it true on many occasions through experiment.
And nevertheless, let no one interfere unless he has tested it, and who, through long use, knows the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians gathered and agreed on cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it affects only the limb that is diseased, and harms no other limb, scarcely.
Burning medicines travel from one limb to another, and cause diseases of difficult healing in the limbs. and perhaps kill the sick person.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm, if there is no excess.
And this I have found through experience and the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
and for this I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for it does not please me to deprive you of the secret that is contained within fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauteries should be performed, and chose springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that arises is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if cauteries are necessary for pains that are forceful and urgent, such that they cannot wait for the time when greater harm might befall the limb.
And do not think about it ever, dear son, as fools do. for the illness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not so as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the constitution and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is valued more than other medicines for its speed, and for the virtue of its action and its authority.
And a powerful thing it is that the illness sometimes comes according to the constitution of the sick person and the location of the illness and its virtue;
and superfluous things gather within him through the consumption of food and similar things, unless cauteries are applied where there is little excess and moisture, like dental cauteries for toothaches, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after other medicines, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last resort in medicine because when we administer various cures for an illness, and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it is effective.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is more effective than one of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and its high substance;
and they said that the place of cautery does not cause corruption, but that is not true, for I have experienced it, and I have found that it is true in some people;
and cautery with gold is more effective than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so do they to the fire; and thus there is enough impediment.
Or I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way might be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two of them done because of a disease called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a dissolving medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and constitution of the patient can bear. and then raise the head of the sick person.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap;
After that, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers come to rest there, then heat the cautery that is called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the location marked with ink, and move your hand gradually downward and inward, turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the area if you see the bone slightly exposed; and if you do not see it, then reapply the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterward take a bit of salt, and place it in water and soften cotton inside, and place it on the area, and leave it there for three days;
after that place moistened cotton in butter; and leave it there until the heat is gone; afterward treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and for this reason, so it is helpful.
And some of them said that the cautery should be applied until part of the bone is burned, and then the burned part of the bone should be removed and the wound treated.
And others say that the cautery should be applied so long, and pressed so hard, that a piece of bone as wide as a spindle that women put in their spindles, is chipped off in order for the humors to come out.
and the wound should be left open for a long time; after that, it should be treated and closed.
And these two types of cauteries do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some men where there is a fear of pain.
and I seem to want to leave it.
for the shoulder is weakened by the continuous dissolving of nature, as we testify in other limbs;
and even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and of this I use in this case together for health.
When chronic pain comes to the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head cleansing, and oils and plasters; and if one performs the cautery that we have previously described, and it is not effective. Beware if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little, which we have described above. After, make a cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery on the place called "vessels"; and it is the place where cupping is applied; and ease your hand so that you do not see all the way to the bone: The patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
And the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle part of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other cures I mentioned in the division of illnesses have been performed, and all of that is of no use: Then, perform cauteries in two ways, namely with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery with sharp medicine is to take a piece of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it into two pieces, and then cut into the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until a suppuration issues.
After the treatment with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is according to this method. Heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because its head is shaped like a closed container or pouch, having little curvature and a small projection in the middle;
and place it on the painful area, hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and that a large amount of blood flows out.
After, place cotton in boiled water, and place it on the area for three days; then place moistened cotton in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," use the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine that is not old.
of migraine
When you treat migraine as we have previously said in the divisions of illnesses, and it doesn't work, and you see that the previously described cauteries of medicine and iron aren't enough, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and then apply it to the painful area in a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone;
and be careful of the jaw that moves when one chews, and that the nerve only moves it and that spasms do not come to the patient, and be wary of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or the cutting causes great fear, especially to someone unfamiliar with it and who is not a student and experienced. and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it on the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better and more helpful than that one.
of the pain in the ears from cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have described in the division have been used, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery that is called "pointed", of which this is the form:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the spot to prick. and make ten pricks around each ear;
then treat the spot until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be treated with cautery is no more than that which is caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and do not apply cautery to conditions that arise from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm from dropsy and purges of the head and gargling, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and apply it to the head of the ear just above a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple as long as a finger; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of cautery:
And it is similar to the scalpel we have placed before, but it is slightly more subtle, and the knife should be slightly thicker;
after treating the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is old, and you treat it as we have said, and it does no good, and the patient has no fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two temples, one in the middle of the head, and one on the place called the "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large pills and powders that cleanse the brain;
Afterwards, raise the patient's head completely, and place a mustard plaster, as described in the treatise on plasters, on the patient's back of the head;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; And if it is not, then make three cauteries from the middle of the head downwards to the neck, and have a space of one finger's breadth between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, then make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others above the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be those called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of scabs and of what we have said before;
Then treat the head of the sick person, then apply cautery in the middle of the head and above each horn, and one behind and three above the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the sick person is suffering, and the illness is severe, then apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave it until most of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cauteries that are called "olivare" be as we have said before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use fire cauteries except the one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to modify the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the sick person is great and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, then make them gargle and chew, thus modifying the brain often with good foods;
Afterwards, place the head in the middle, and make [the] cauterization according to what we have said before, and cauterize on the vessel, and on each horn. And if the patient is strong and enduring, then apply cauteries as I have said for those with paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-oil according to the manner I have described.
If the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cauterization according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, superfluities or corrupted moisture and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with the same cauteries as we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are descending into melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something that will cleanse the brain, according to what is mentioned earlier in the division.
After this, treat the patient's head; after that, make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits crossed-legged, and be firmly held on all sides;
after that, apply the liniment, and it is worth a measure of old bear's grease; and heat it with gentle fire, so that the patient can tolerate it when applied; after that, empty the circle from inside the head, and allow it to cool;
and do this to the patient each week once with other good treatment, until he is healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it by making several punctures throughout the cautery.
This manner of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and goose fat.
of the water of the eyes When water comes first to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something that cleanses the head, and guard it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times on an empty stomach.
Afterwards, command him to rear his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make him two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is to both eyes together, or on one if the descent is in one;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of the outflow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then staunch it with as much power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
And sometimes one makes cautery or a cautery-like instrument under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the ailment descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cautery-like instruments under the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help at all, then give the sick person three nights' worth of cochies to drink; after you have treated the head, and you make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and watch out that you do not cut the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by disease and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the membrane is burned, according to the manner I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are applied in two ways: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, draw on the patient's eyelids a shape like a myrtle leaf, with the beginning of the sign next to the hairs;
then place moistened cotton in egg white and persilyon mush on the eye, then heat the cautery, whose shape is:
Afterwards, cauterize on the shape you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned there;
and the sign of the effectiveness of the work is that you see the eyelid drawn back, and the hairs raised at the point of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it like that for three days, then apply moistened cotton in butter until the heat is gone; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hair grows, and the eyelid is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, as you did at first;
and if the hair has fallen out, cauterize until the eyelid is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hair grow large and equal, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take some French soap and live charcoal, one ounce of each, and grind them well together; and quickly do it, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the shape that you have made, like the leaf of myrtle, and place it over the eyelid; and if the patient has pain in one eye only, one must work on one, and if in both, likewise. and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your presence, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for it feels burning like fire.
When you have done this a long time, then remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the affected area with water, and observe if you see the skin raised as if it had been raised by the force of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is good.
If not, then reapply medicine to the area where the medicine has not yet worked, until your actions are equal, and your vision is clear.
Then place damp cotton in butter until the burning has subsided, then treat the area with ointment called "diafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if you need to be careful in your work, take great care that no medicine gets into your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterwards, and the hair pricks the eye, then reapply the medicine to the area softened by the paper properly, as you did before. treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size and smallness, and according to this, let your restraints be.
And the straight path should not be blocked to the one who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are of no benefit, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the patient to place their head on your lap. and let the assistant hold the patient's head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shift.
Then put moistened cotton in a hard-boiled egg or in parsley juice over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a vault's feather, together with which the cautery should be.
If you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it may also be like a tent;
However, this one which is shaped like this is suitable for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it and extract the matter;
Then apply the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand on the cautery to the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If you bring the cautery to the bone at the beginning, it would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if needed, and leave it for three days;
After that, apply softened cotton in butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply an aqueous corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what he would prescribe in his chapter.
And there is a method of cautery for fistulas that none of the ancients said. Understand, regarding a fistula, and cut the area; After that, place a fine, thin strip of material of this shape: and it is the quantity of a lead .3. and hold your hand or the strip firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye a cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead will burn the fistula area, and heal it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have mentioned, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer remedies to the nose, and return the fistula to the nose's body in its proper place.
Cracks in the lips Very often cracks appear in the lips, called "poil," especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have mentioned in the divisions, and the treatment does not help, then heat a small knife-cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly on those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or the uvula, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, afterward it causes decay and rot, and becomes aged and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in divisions, and it does not profit at all: then it is necessary that you use cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand so that the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and in the furthest place;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is cured thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and that is not worthwhile, then place the head of the patient on your chest; afterwards, heat the cautery, of which the shape will come here later, in such a way that you place a cane on the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery inside, and hold your hand for so long that the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
afterwards, lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterwards, let the patient fill his mouth with salty water, and let it soak for an hour and rinse thoroughly.
And in this way, the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, where there is cold or true cold, and the treatments of medicine are not effective, then there is need for cautery according to two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and place it on the end of an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and dip it in boiling butter, and quickly put it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools;
and thus do frequently until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron on top until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take a piece of iron or bronze, and it should be thick enough so that the heat does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, which will take the following shape, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then remove it quickly.
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whatever shape you desire, and according to your ability;
and this is the shape of the cauterization:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery as described below in the form, and have two openings for the fumes to escape on the other side of the cautery;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burning is relieved;
afterward treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the bronchial passages, and especially when this comes from a cold temperament, then the patient must first be purged by solution medicines;
Afterwards, cauterize at the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat itself, and do not burn the heart but a little.
Afterwards, he applies another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile", be of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have previously stated until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries above the collarbone in empty spaces; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries be, which are called "clavile," according to the form previously stated.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking all the cautery which is called "poins," of which the form is above in the illness of the ears;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the area according to what has been previously stated, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And for that the cauteries are lighter, for that you make three at a stroke.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, the patient should be supported on their back and side; Afterwards, lift the heart which is within the tittle at the tips of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, whose shape is like this:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the shape of the cautery would be like four cauteries together;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shape of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one more nerve is added, so that there are eight cauteries.
After that, put the cautery on the broken pieces with a bandage; after that, have the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then apply cautery on the thick part of the cautery's clavile, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture enter the stomach, so that it is forced to its complexion, and the catarrh multiplies in him, and the usual cures are of no use, then the patient must be placed on his back, and stretch out his legs and hands. From this on, apply three cauteries: one beneath the nipple of the breast by the width of a finger, to the entire cautery clavile, and two cauteries outside the two sides, so that the figure of the cauteries forms a three-sided angle, and there is such spacing between each that when they cast off pus, they are not joined together.
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the figure of the cauteries be according to this shape without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape;
and whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and marking on the stomach at a point according to the quantity you desire; then cauterize with the entire cautery that is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold and moisture and a large flatulence, as it is excessively changed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and if the patient is treated with what we have said about divisions, and it does him no good, then the patient must be examined concerning his constitution; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, to avoid the hypochondria, where the ribcage of the man comes from;
and have a space of a finger's breadth between each cautery; and let the cauteries be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient stand upright;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach pus, for the heart is very sensitive there, and you know this to be true.
When he has an abscess on the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the liver flesh or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the sick person feels pain not too strongly;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And when this treatment should drain the pus, the patient must be propped up on his head;
and then drain the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery that is similar to a ray, of which this is the shape: And cauterize with the cautery until the skin is burned, and it comes down to the surface, so that the pustule is entirely gone;
after the treatment, according to the treatment for sores, until it is healed;
and it is not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine extensively, and whose hands have often treated these illnesses.
Then he may work boldly, and nevertheless I think it is better to leave it alone.
about cautery with a pointed instrument
The ancients said that cauteries with aristolochia roots should be done with a pointed instrument, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and hold it over the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the shoulder blade and the neck, and two small cauteries a little further down on the part under the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one more above the stomach, and one between the two shoulder blades, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery made like a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess; and the pain leaves, just as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work, there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse, from what we have said about the divisions of cures, and it does no good, then there are three types of cautery, all of which are good.
Of which one way is that you make three or four cauteries, along the length of the mouse, following the shape of the liver cautery we mentioned before;
and do not press your hand too hard on all the cautery, and let the patient lie often on his back;
and another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and raise the part where the mouse is, or where the patient's side comes from the left, and the elevation by which you raise the part should be, according to the curvature, along the length of the body, and the cauteries should be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two inflamed nerves in such a way that the parts are pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four of them.
And if you wish, cauterize with the cautery of three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned before.
Cautery is of no use to a person with dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not benefit, then you must make four cauteries around the ribcage, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thick part of the heart.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the clavile that we have shown before. And that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been stated before.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deep, lest the yellow water should burst forth, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
After that, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the shin; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so that the yellow water may exit;
after the treatment of other cures that we have mentioned.
When belly pain comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by various treatments; and you see the sick person enduring and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what was discussed before, or a circling cautery of the stomach; and four small cauteries around the flank, a single small cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the sick person suffering, then make a cautery on the groin, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are at the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of thick cold and moist corrupt humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those that are completely outside under the hip bone little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery under the flank two inches.
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and you see the face swell, then make a large cautery on the stomach, as it is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with all the cauteries close together. And leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, leave the area until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it completely ablaze onto the cut althelul; and there leave it so long that the cautery reaches the beginning of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; after the treatment with ointments, until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will have greater aid.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, as we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be cured except by cautery.
When a fistula comes upon someone, and it is old and throws out rotting and corrupt moisture, you should test it with a thin probe, and be sure to know how deep the probe goes into the fistula.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and insert it into the fistula according to the depth the probe went in.  And repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed.
And be careful not to burn the sensitive nerves and large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder or intestine, be careful around those places, and only make the burns on fleshy areas, and consider that it is not completely penetrating.
Then treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is infected, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, as one of those we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great windiness, and does not take the form of a woman's complaint, then you must apply cautery to the kidneys on one side and the other with the wedge cautery we have mentioned before.
And if we cauterize it in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and this will provide greater assistance.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and softened by cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then apply cautery to the outside of the bladder, where the hair of the skin begins, one on the right and one on the left, and each cautery should be as long as the width of a thumb.
And apply one cautery to the back, or two if necessary.
And let the cauteries be shaped as previously described.
When the marrow is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the blossoms are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: Then it is necessary that one makes three cauteries around the bulge, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery resembling a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cauteries be like those with which one has cauterized the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain of the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment is not working, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other good similar pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is thus according to two manners: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is according to many manners, of which one is such:
that you cauterize above the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery a space the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is applied in the middle above the head of the hip joint, so that there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the core are burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is located in the hip and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four inches, slightly to the left side.
And let the cauteries be sharp, and let the thick parts of the core be burned.
And if the patient feels the pain extend to two inches or near the heel, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four times with the cautery called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a sharp or circular cautery, and be very careful with all your cauteries that you don't leave the cautery on long enough to burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you don't cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and left them on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After an abdominal solution from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cauteries in one and the other, according to this method.
And the wise men said, concerning the cautery of the hip, that this is the way: make a cautery iron that is as thick as the head of a fingertip, or slightly less; and it should be in sections, and from one section to the next, a space the width of a fingernail.
and let the sections be opposite each other, and be like knots, and let there be a handle of iron well made;
and this is the form:
And it should be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then it is placed upon the sore hip, and turned to the healthy side.
and cauterize one time, let it heal and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment of ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and few are seen who use it;
and nevertheless, this is a good cautery for those who can endure it, and the place where it is applied.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make a tool with crossbars, on which the margin of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and have two grooves, and between each the thickness of a finger; and be open at the front and top, and join together in this shape:
Then place the hip of the lying patient on the healthy side, and place your hand firmly on the hip; then pour between the two circles hot water that has been heated in a pan for a short time, and let it sit for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burn.
For it finds a burn just like fire;
and when the burn is gone, remove your hand with the instrument and raise the hip with soft water, and leave it like this for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days for the pus to come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or to the leg, you make one instrument that soaks with water according to what you did to the hip in the same way;
and that is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where it has a small hole to let the point of a razor enter;
where it has a small hole to let the point of a razor enter; and place over that pot another pot well-sealed, and put alkali and lime and sweet water on top, so much that there is a finger's width above the powders when you have it well held in your hand;
and leave it like that until it drips down as watery matter into the sealed pot, then take all that water and pour it back onto the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very thin and is administered in the manner of medical treatments and cauterizations of other limbs.
For it works like fire, and there are other medicines used for cauterizing well the hip, such as turpentine and honey and gum arabic and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and praises it highly, saying that no other treatment was done, and that he was healed in one instance after this treatment, and that he had bathed as he teaches us hereafter.
And says in this manner that you should take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it thoroughly with a little fat, and place it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bandage it.
and leave it on for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly damp, and put him into bed, and the pain will depart entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery or such medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps greatly.
and the cauteries should be made in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it over the hollow between the big toe and the other one, which is called the foscile.
Afterwards, take dry goat's dung, and heat it in fire until it is embers, and put it over the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
and do this again, and do not cease doing so until you believe by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goat".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling, or from impact, or from excessive evacuation, or from a spreading cold matter, none of these conditions are helped by cauteries, except that which comes from an infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been relieved of foul pills or other similar things, that one make three lines of incisions on his back, where the pain is located, and on each line, 5 cauteries, or more, according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery that is called "points";
and if you wish, make 3 or 4 cauteries at the middle clavicle cautery according to this form:
This illness often comes to young children, and the signs of its beginning are that they have a narrow chest when they rise, and fear; and you find in the posterior spine of the back and in the appearance that comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery touches each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that pierces two or three lines, and let the punctures be close together.
After the cure, treat the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful that you do not apply cautery to a swelling that is in a nerve bundle.
of the pain in the joints
When pains in the joints are due to moisture that spreads throughout the body's limbs, and when pain comes to the feet, which the doctors properly call "podagra," and when it is caused by cold and medicines cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it needs to be pierced on the sole of the foot, make a cautery at the entire place called a "point. And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, in the shape of an olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand on it for any longer than the skin of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in this chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make punctures around the bones two lines apart;
and if there remains any pain in the fingers, make punctures on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and provide good care to the patient and administer medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge the phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the swelling descends to the testicles and is new, then when you wish to treat it, let him not eat that day. and that he use things that loosen the stomach, so that the waste descends from his belly.
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the swelling has subsided, and bring it back with your fingers, and make a mark below the rupture, over the bone of the groin, and make a mark that resembles half a circle above the body.
Then heat the cautery with which this form is made:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then bring the bowels back to their place. and the minister should hold his hand over them so they do not return.
and properly support the patient's thighs, placing a cushion underneath and a servant on top of the thighs, and another on top of the chest holding his hands.
then place the cautery on the mark with all your hand, hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, start it again another time until you come to the bone. and carefully watch that the bowel does not jump when you are using the cautery. that you do not burn it. and that through this the patient does not die, or suffer other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries for children be subtle according to their size, and for large people as large according to their size.
After three days, treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is gone.
After that, treat with other ointments until healed, and the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is properly healed.
And it is necessary that their nourishments be lessened for a long time, so that the bowels do not discharge when they attempt to move about the chambers.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
and have good rest, that he work little and guard against overfilling with drink and food, and from loud shouting.
And when he follows this instruction, he is entirely healed.
And I will say afterwards the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you want them to grow no more, apply fire cautery to it according to its quantity, and let the third part of the core be burned. after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the location and make a line along the width above the rupture, and another outside, and then place your hand in the middle, applying the entire cautery to the wound.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, either from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the treatment of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a cautery called "points", and the cauteries should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and virtue and its location of torsions and its pain.
if it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, then repeat another cautery upon that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the limb that is nearby, therefore you must perform the cauteries until the patient is healed.
The mixture is sometimes aided by cautery with great help, and especially the illnesses that arise from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, take care if the illness is in its beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and it neither decreases nor stays, and you doubt that the corruption might consume the entire patient, then make five cauteries upon the head: One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors may escape;
and cauterize on the mouse according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is scattered everywhere; and if it is manifestly lost, you must cauterize it with these cauteries that we have said on the head, and one cautery on the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the calf, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the arm, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more aid you give him, and the more profit he gains;
And know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the manner of irons.
After the cure, cover the place with flour of vetches with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When swelling comes to any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then you make cauteries on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cauteries be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauterization is done to the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that paralyzes the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
However, no one should intervene if they are not knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" is advanced, and the tools of medicine are of no value, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and a portion of each, blood of a colon and blood of an almond. and mix all together, and bind with a cloth, and keep it aired in place until it is healed.
The cure of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that appears as a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise ones say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen several times;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular," as we have said in many discussions of cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it delays healing, either due to the excess it causes or because of the patient's age—when he is decrepit (that is, too old)—and he has little blood, or due to the time; and you want to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small, pricking cauteries; after that, leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you want to pierce it with the entire cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
And place your hand in the middle of the illness called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outside in such a manner that the course of the putrefaction is relieved.
After that, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness called "corrodens", which is nothing more than a consumption of the limb, for it eats the limbs just as fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the illness is.
After cauterizing from all sides, until you have eradicated all corruption and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas a soft poultice with oil until the heat from the fire is gone, and all corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
and if not, then repeat the cautery on any remaining corrupted areas.
And this corruption is sometimes treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is more helpful, and I have already discussed the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of boils that come on the feet Many times it happens that on the feet, from the outside, a disease arises that is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, festering thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this illness are according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just like a pointed piece of iron, and it should be made of good iron, sized so that it can grasp the boil from all sides, and that it has thin edges;
After that, put it hot onto the boil, and turn your hand all around the boil until it reaches the bottom of the boil; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make him a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the boil will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are caused by burns on the body, and often happen on the hands and feet, then you should apply a cautery of hot water; and is in such a manner: take a rod of brass or iron, or a piece of hot iron, and put it on the boil and the ulcer, that is to say, for warts; and place the rod so that it covers the entire area, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the boil, and can find the hot water a path deep down to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will detach itself from all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you should apply four cauteries along the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the person's health will be hastened from the cold illness.
Sometimes appear on the body's surface, sores or putrid pustules, that come from large corrupted materials.
If they appear, then one should immediately apply cautery to each head of the pustule. a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated in the fire, or of long aristolochia root, or to the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this method, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they came are broken, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great bleedings of blood occur from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and in similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stanch.
And nevertheless, when this happens to someone, hasten to place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and hold it firmly until the blood is stilled beneath your finger, and no more drops issue forth;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large, into the fire until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out forcefully when you remove your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stanched;
and be careful not to burn the nerve nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood gushes from the artery, it cannot be properly stanched, especially when the artery is large, unless it is done by one of the four ways that we have said: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong binding of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stanch blood; and be bound and constricted, the event.
Whoever applies a styptic by tightly binding cloths or by placing burning things on it, or other similar things, will only profit very little.
And if this happens to someone and they have no mirror or medicine present, they should place their index finger over the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding is stopped over the wound and over the vein; and do not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, so that it is very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and make inquiries beforehand about the cauteries and medicines he needs.
In the first chapter, we have told you all diseases in which fire cautery or burning medicines are needed, and their causes, instruments, and forms.
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will follow the same path in this chapter so that what is sought can be found more easily.
And before I begin this, my dear son, you must understand that this chapter involves more danger and fear than the first on cauteries, and therefore greater caution is required.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many people come to treatments. so come those who become so enraged with their illness that they die easily due to the frenzy they find in their illness, and the great nature of their illness; and of these one should have fear.
And of these there are those who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put more regard on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely concerning that of which you are certain, and of which you can have received praise.
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients, so that health may be restored;
and this will help you acquire good renown, glory, and a memory of praise.
Dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and if you wish to inspire yourself with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now, I have ordered this chapter in divisions by chapters, according to that which is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have explained from head to foot, so that you find more easily that which you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the mother's grip is too tight on the child's head.
and sometimes it comes from a cause unknown.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I saw, death quickly followed. And for this reason, it seems to me that I would better leave this work on such cases.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until it could no longer be supported.
And the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture gathers under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
And the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide opening in the head;
and be as long as two fingers, until the moisture flows out.
And see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more profound, and the abscess is larger, make two openings in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs are that you see the edges of the head open on either side, and the pus jumps out when you press your hand into it, and this has not yet subsided: then it is necessary that you split the head into three openings in this manner:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outward. Afterward, bind the openings with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil in it, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry foods with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another way of incision is that you look where the large size of the abscess is, and the gathering of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes to the right; and sometimes to the left.
Then cut there where the abscess is open, and the accumulation of water, and cut it according to what you are able to do;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When it happens to someone a sickness that is called "catarrh" in the eyes or on the chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the medicine's cure does not help, then the last cure is cauterization, with which one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient hold back his head. Afterwards, they rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the entire cloth. Then look where the vein is, and the places on both sides of the ears, and the little ones are nearby.
Then mark the places precisely, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel from two sides, until the cut goes down to the bone, and that is along the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through it.
And when the vein is cut, the blood will spurt out continuously upwards.
And if the artery is not apparent upon feeling, then you must measure the amount of space of three fingers, then mark precisely and cut down to the bone.
And that which needs to be removed of blood is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear and the fullness of the artery.
then examine the wound: if there remains on the bone any bit of rough surface, then cut it so that no festering boils arise, then restrain the wound and bind it, and apply ointment for treatment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to moisture in the tears and heat in the temples, and chronic madness, and similar things, and he is treated with various medical treatments and none of it helps him, then we should drain the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should draw back the hair from his temples, and find the artery that is apparent in the temple, for it appears clearly through its beatings, and is rarely not apparent except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, the patient tightens its collar with some straps, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and pricks the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, of which this is the form: then scrape the skin slightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues below it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the tip of the hook, then cut it off in that section according to the quantity of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely stop flowing.
And draw the blood from VI c/ until III;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot comes before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the knife cautery to the bone so that the heads are cut off;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauteries are a help for finishing the moistures: Therefore, it is of greater help to moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of the arteries that one fill the space with old cotton and place well-made bandages over it;
and when one removes them, they should be treated with dry medicines that promote healing, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you work on it, hurry to cauterize it, or fill the space with vitriol and hold it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that available, place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and wash the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and hold it as needed;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the hot iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and keep them apart at the two sides, because it is not entirely sealed with this cautery;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the easiest and more gentle way in extracting an artery is to cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the blade should be wide to maintain its heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes run down the veins on the head's surface, and no treatment by medicine helps, and you see the patient's face turn red, and feel a tremor on their forehead; and if the eyes are watery and moist, so that the hairs on the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are inflamed and scorched by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contusion treatment," and you must do this to the patient who has this illness:  pull the hairs from their forehead, then make three cuts in their forehead evenly along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusion treatment," and you must do this to the patient who has this illness:  pull the hairs from their forehead, then make three cuts in their forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; and one cut should be as though two, right in the middle of the forehead down to the nose, and the other two along the sides of the eyelids, being careful not to cut the arteries on the sides of the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jawbones, and each wound should be the size of three fingers across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths for wiping the blood, then take a sharp spatula of two parts, like this shape:
from the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh between the two cuts across the entire surface above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatula. then place in the first cut the instrument called a "cultellaire", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh closest to the flesh, and the blunt side towards the bone, and place it until it reaches the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to that which appears of the flesh, and then do the same in the middle cut until the other opening;
and then draw out the blood equally, and squeeze the place to remove the blood taken;
then put in each cut a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths soaked in wine, oil, and vinegar, and be careful that no hot abscesses come there;
and on the third day, loosen the bandage, and apply a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments for healing wounds, until it is healed.
When some have acute colds, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the vision weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and there is sharp pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that those matters and that cold do not come from anything other than many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you command the patient to lie on their back, then make a large incision across the forehead, and another a wide one through the eyebrows. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when chewing;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood away with a sponge, then separate the two edges of the incision and put old cotton and linen strips in there; then bind on top moistened cloths in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with things that dry out, which cause flesh to grow.
In such a manner: Take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow throughout.
of the stopping up of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or vermin, or a mine stone or similar thing such as iron; or seeds, such as beans, peas, lentils; or flowing things such as water and pus and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not join with the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distil a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with something, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often, pus comes out through this treatment;
and if it does not come out, administer extraction with subtle forceps, of which this is the shape:
If it comes out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, then administer extraction with a subtle, small double-edged hook;
and if it still does not come out by that, make a bronze pin and put the head of the pin in the opening of the ear firmly, and seal what is around the pin with soft wax so that wind cannot enter with the pin; then pull it out forcefully, for many times it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this way, take a glue with which birds are caught, and put on it some instrument well-suited for that, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the glue against the stone or whatever it is, and pull out forcefully.
And if it does not come out with all these things that we have said, hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess forms, and causes spasm;
And the way of the incision is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and drain blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at the fat or dependent area; and let the incision be as a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it to the best of your ability, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with subtle tweezers and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use a sneeze-inducing remedy, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on the same ear where the water is. If it stops flowing from there, it is good.
If not, then take several small, light stones, the length of your finger, and warm them slightly in the fire; and place one in the patient's ear, and let him jump up and down on the other foot, and place another stone on the stone in the ear; and do not cease to put stone on stone until all the water comes out completely, and thus it will all come out completely;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end apply to the fire until the softest part of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said of the stone.
In extracting a small beast, such as a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In extracting worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not benefit, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, then draw them out with fine tweezers; and if they do not appear, then take the cautery of which this is the form:
And it should be narrow underneath and wide above. And put the finest end into the ear according to the amount of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly on the whole cautery; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey to come out, then stuff around the cautery with cotton as I said for the stone;
and if they do not leap out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatment of distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this entire instrument, of which this is the form as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow below with little holes, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation with a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around its sharpened point; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you wish of your medicines, into the channel, and the channel should be in the ear;
then place the scraper, with all the cotton, inside, and press with your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the ear's cavity; and the patient should feel it inside, and let the distillation be a bit heated by fire before distilling it into the ear; and be careful that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
of the stoppage of the ears
No children are born who do not have any openings in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through blockage of a wound, or of a growth inside the ear, and these blockages sometimes extend deep into the ear, so one cannot see them;
and sometimes the blockage protrudes from the opening, and one can see it clearly.
That which extends deep within, so that it cannot be seen, requires a more serious treatment in several ways, and in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then open up this entire accumulation according to the shape of it:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the blockage is of flesh born within or on the body of the ear, then hold it with delicate forceps, and cut it gently until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a fine, light scraper and warm it a little in the fire, then put it in the ear canal.
If you feel a blockage of which the patient feels pain when hearing, pierce it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and soak it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood, which are found in the treatment of discharges.
This ailment, which comes in papules on the eyes when they are moist and dry, should be treated by removing them with tweezers and forceps, and cutting it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin, lenticular cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is worth doing;
and many times they return, when some part remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Many times there come from the eyes small things that resemble hail in shape and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and it is a gathering of thick moisture in the eye tissue above and below. the work is such:
the work is such: watch if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know;
Then cut it from the wide part, then scrape it lightly from each part, then take it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the tissue a little, it will not harm the patient;
and if the fissure is large, assemble it with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not apply force, for ointments will quickly restore it and create flesh.
And if the stone is descending into the inner ear towards the upper part, reverse the tissue, and extract the stone with tweezers, and cut it and press it from one side and the other;
and if the tissue is separated by the incision, that will not hurt;
and when the stone is cut, wash the area with salty water, and treat the area with something that creates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is formed in webs of the tissues above, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it hurts their eyes greatly, and catarrh comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sun's light because their tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this, they often lie on their faces, and sleep on their backs, and their tissues under their eyebrows are moist, that the swelling and appearance have covered with the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places their head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then place it over it; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture with a sharp instrument, a slit of a width no greater than a wound made when opening a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many positions exinach comes from the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then pull it out completely with a piece of cloth tucked between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed.
and be careful not to add to the slit, that you don't reach the entire spatumile all the way to the eye, that you don't injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then pull it out as we have said, then soak cloths in oil and water, and place them over the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind soil and apply it to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the papers When extra hairs grow on the eyelids, and they become aged, they harm the eyes, and cause various illnesses such as habitual tears and softenings of the eyelids and albuginea, to the point that this causes the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four ways: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before or in the chapter of cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitches or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid to your left hand;
if it has turned, that is good; if not, then place a needle on the entire thread above it; and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread above the entire eyelid, and turn it to the razor;
then cut in the part below the eyelid, below the adjacent hairs, all the way through, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth below the eyelid, then place an almond-shaped figure, like a myrtle leaf, on top of the eyelid, however, the shape should be according to the amount you want to raise the eyelid, which is divided into parts.
And if someone has to cut a large amount of the eyelid according to how soft the eyelid is;
then cut all the way through above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and let one of the cuts be close to the natural hairs, the width of a root, then insert the needle into one of the two angles of the core, and then scrape it all away;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch of a fine wool needle, and wipe away the blood, and dry the excess threads along the two eyebrows with some kind of glue, if you wish to do this;
and if not, then give no more treatment, then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitches with dry and constricting things, for the paper is renewed in the sealing of the wound and its joining together, but the stitch is weaker (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and if there is another method:
and if there is another method: and is that you mark the paper with a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted, in three separated ovals according to the form that is here:
then cut what is above with small equal forces according to the form that is here:
And if you do not have the power to hold the tongs, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and join the threads between your fingers evenly;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin above which you have marked, as we have recounted, then join the two lips of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerote and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the skin are turned;
so it is necessary that you use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of the canes is according to this form: and it is that you turn the skin and the wound according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin cords as long as the skin and the width of the spatula are; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly on that which rises from the skin of the eye, and tighten the two canes of the two parts evenly; and leave it thus for a few days, and the skin that is tightened will die and harden and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with some force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the skin is lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and that is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine and soft silk thread in it; then assemble the heads and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your lap;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with all the thread into the root of the hair, and pierce the paper quickly so that you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and place that hair in the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand so that the hairs come out with the entire chase in the paper with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, you shall pull the chase from below with all the thread that you have ordained, so that the chase comes out of the opening above and that you see it through the vision of the eye;
Then you shall pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed two or three days, so that the hair hardens in its place and the flesh grows over;
and if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with it or you let it grow, until it is elongated and then remove it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this illness, which is called "aleacrati" or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through a wound, or cutting, or cautery, and similar things.
And the way of treating it is that you split the wound, and separate the edges of it, and put linen bandages inside, and bind it until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and restrain. For if you do that, the sickness will return worse than the first.
but use remedies that soften it, such as fennel. and irrigate with boiled water or flaxseed, and apply melted diachylon ointment in any oil, and wrap a bandage around it, and treat it with this.
And the secret of your treatment is that you must take care that it does not heal in the same shape as before.
And these remedies we have mentioned are only treatments for this illness, so that it does not return in the same form as before.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cauterization and similar things;
And the way of the treatment is that you take a needle, with a double thread on it, and pierce the flesh, starting at the left tear duct and going to the right, so that the thread goes through the flesh in two places;
Then stretch the flesh over the needle and cut it with a spatula, wide. And if the shape of the paper returns according to what is necessary, that is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the cut, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision you have made, and make angles so that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "a Greek I";
Then remove that flesh, according to how sharp the edges are beneath, of what covered the paper, then join the two separated parts and sew them with a woolen thread;
Then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a cut or suture or cautery, then you must make a clean cut beneath the hairs of the paper, and according to what has been said before; then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and skilled masters devise remedies with all their power how to restore the figure to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are needed in various conditions.
When this joining happens to human hands in such a way that the paper on top is joined with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is airtight with a subtle scalpel, which should not be too sharp or too sharp, so that the patient cannot endure the too-sharp scalpel injuring the eye;
and let your incision, by which you scrape that assembly, be gentle, so that the paper returns to its natural form;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they make use of salty water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water and colic;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and put soaked wool on the eye, abundant in egg white; and after the third day use of colic and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: It is nervous and resembling hard skin, and another that is not nervous, but is like frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to pinch it, one cannot.
And both kinds begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, and all light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient should put his head on your breast, then you open his eyes; and lift the paper with your hand, then pinch the nail with small tweezers, and extend it upwards; then take a needle and put a horsehair, or cowhair, or oxhair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it through the entire needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape all the hair from the side of the nail that touches the pupil and silk to the hair to the top, then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a very thin spatula and small forces, and leave the natural tear duct, so that the body of the tears does not come about by the incision;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with the hook alone, and with the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with the entire soft spatula, of which this is the form:
And guard that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little of boiled lead, and a collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with whatever is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push in the needle, and the tweezers cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured with medicines;
and grow as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a slightly pointed spatula according to this shape: And carefully cut the nail from above, and if you see that it diminishes slightly and the reason is near, then distil from your mouth into the eye collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and lead, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is contrary to you in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first cure the boil until it is healed, then resume the work as before, until it is healed.
then resume the other work according to this same operation, until it is entirely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct flesh harms the eye by great injury, then suspend it from the hook, and cut off a part, and not all of it, so that the tears do not come forth;
then distil red collyrium, which is made of litharge, into the eye.
In some men's eyes, flesh sometimes grows red, covering the pupil and pressing against the eyelids, and resembling a rose-colored bloom.
And the treatment is that the patient should place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and with suitable hooks, hold all that flesh, and support it with force.
Then cut away the initial flesh, and continue cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye during the procedure.
And let the incision be of the spatula type, as we described in the incision of the fingernail and with small, controlled force with which one removes the scab, as the form following this chapter demonstrates.
And when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, apply to the eye a mixture of powdered stones or distilled red ochre and similar corrosive medicines, and place over the eye a protective covering of cotton with a bandage of egg white, so that any inflammatory swelling is subdued.
And if anything remains, and the blood flow overwhelms you, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave the eye alone and treat the abscess with things that soothe hot abscesses.
Then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do for all flesh that is adhered to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you mitigate the treatment for each eye, according to the natural course. and from the accidental course, in the work of iron.
And do not put your hand into any of these works until you see that these limbs are enduring that work.
Those are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder its function and weaken the eye every day.
It is necessary therefore, that first you look if the eye, in which the blood-vessels are, is strong, and there is no other illness besides the blood vessels; then treat it in this way:
instruct the patient to place their head in your own, then bind those veins around the entire circumference according to your skill, and let the bandages be thin, double, according to this shape:
And let the two bandages be in degrees on one side according to this shape:
then, with force, bind those veins subtly, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those strong veins move away from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you only cut the veins;
and when you have done this, distill green and red gall into the eye to corrupt that which remains of the scab.
And if you cannot collect all of this at that time, make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is eased and you are sure there is no hot abscess, then begin again according to this manner that is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the forces:
The mire is called "arissati" fistula:
when you cure it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then you should cut into the abscess, where it should stay, and remove all the moisture that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, you should remove it with the instrument described in this form;
and it is called "aspre chief," and should be made of iron, shaped like a head, and pointed like a file, as shown in the present form:
And place it on the spot of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the spot with drying medicines.
if the spot is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and remains like this for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not an abscess, and no bad accidents occur, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with an iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head have three angles, and the shaft be thinned to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the spot hardens, the matter goes to the nose; it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no disturbance or reduction in the nose, then you must bandage the patient;
then you heal it, then put leeches or cupping glasses on it without hitting it, to suck, then put on the eye a bandage made of acacia, aloe, incense and sarcocolla, and then constrict the eye, and apply the plaster over it with bandages and strips;
and the method of the strips is that you take fairly soft strips, and double each into four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then constrict it firmly over a hard bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to suck without hitting;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye constricted day and night, and if the bandages soften, you must constrict it more;
then remove the bandage after the day and night, and if you see the eye repairing, that is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster, bandages, the bandage, and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
from the tearing of cloth or with When disruptions occur in the cloth or with it, then it appears and comes forth from the papers like a grain of resin, and is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it cut, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the part underneath, down to the part above, then put another needle where there is a doubled thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the doubled thread and tie a part of the cloth around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on a wet wool cloth, abundant in egg;
and leave it until the thread comes apart with the cloth, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the cloth, each part in a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great signs, pierce it with a fine needle that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and go inside immediately;
then withdraw it until it is healed.
This disease, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than a bag formed in the eye, resembling a descending boil, and it is not a boil;
and the way to treat it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the bag come up above your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the light should be clear, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend from below, know that it is a boil, and if the descent of the bag is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the subtle spatula and pierce the cornea slightly along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the bag comes out;
and when it is out, then distill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
of the eye's boils We have already described the appearance of the boils in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; so work according to the health.
You should have the sick person sit between your crossed hands, out of the sunlight, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper from the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument beside the crown by the thickness of a fingernail in the white of the eye near the tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces into the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the measure of the almagda's path should be at the depth of the space from the pupil to the end of the black part; and that is the crown of the eye;
and you will see the bone in that membrane through the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument to the point where the point is, and then press it along one path after another.
If the point descends now, the patient will see before him the instrument in his eye.
After a short rest, and if the point ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not rise, extract the almagda gently by rotating your hand little by little;
and then put a little drop of gem-salt onto the point, and lift that from the eye. Then apply over the eye bandages or wool moistened in rose oil and a quantity of egg, and bind with the sound eye.
We, and those of our time, place a compress with plenty of egg on it.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are some people whose eyes are too hard, then you must take the instrument called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, and then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movements, and let him eat light foods, and do not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see certain things, and then return the bandage until the seventh day;
and it is not fitting that you do this during the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you postpone this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and apply that which relieves the abscess;
and when it is appeased, then unbind the vision and place a cloth or linen upon his face for a certain day, and let him be once more in that dark room.
And then let him leave the house little by little, and return to his activities.
And know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from the Yrach, who told us that in their country people made a magda pierced, into which water is poured, but nevertheless I have never seen any in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; And perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And their heads are of this same fineness, and the back in three sharp angles.
Sometimes additional diverse fleshy growths appear on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and some have flesh deeply embedded of dark color, and some soft flesh of good color. In that one, then, of these soft flesh, and not embedded, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one, then, of these soft flesh, and not embedded, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut what you can hold onto with a thin sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh has all been removed.
And if any part remains that cannot be cut, you must open it with all thin instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if it gets overwhelming, or the abscess is hot, then care for it as is proper;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply fresh, cool, and sharp wine. If the poultice works, and moisture comes up to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if the moisture does not pierce as it should, know that there is new flesh growing on the bone above, which the instruments cannot cut.
Then it is necessary to put in a linen thread somewhat thick, and tie it with your hands, and have a space of a finger or less between each knot. and have the patient hold the thread's end in their nose to the best of their ability, and pull it gently until it comes out of the nose into the mouth;
and many children do so in schools, and it is an easy thing for those who want to do it;
Then hold the end that comes out of the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes out of the mouth in the other hand, and draw them one after the other while holding the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have rotted that flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh;
and then put a lead chain in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a small tube, and the conduit like it;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and let it have a handle at the top to hold it when the oil or any liquid is heated.
from the skin over the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the top of the nose, and it grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then put the cautery or burning medicine over the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then be wary if it is hard, of a dark color, of poor feeling:
if you do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, there comes great harm to the patient;
and if the abscess is easy to touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut out, then drain the patient and cut it out without fear, and treat the place with dry and binding things.
Know that when a solution to a problem in one of these cartilage treatments comes, it is of little use, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two edges together with a stitch, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on either side, you must scorch all parts of their flesh until they bleed, then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and tighten it, and sprinkle powder on powder of dragon's blood and crushed incense; and put a piece of strong plaster or another healing plaster over the powders, and leave it until it falls off on its own, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitching is that you bring together the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
of abscesses of the lips
Hard abscesses occur in the lips of men, resembling grains of millet, and smaller and larger;
Then you should turn back the lips and make incisions on each spot, and take them with forceps and cut them in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then lift the dressing and treat the area with dry things until it is healed.
Many times, extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
If so, you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the area;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, which often happens, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: If it does not return after cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and worm-eaten, so that the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
If so, you should make the patient sit between your hands, and their head be in your lap, and scrape the teeth or scabs appearing, until nothing remains; and in the same way do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other blemishes, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first attempt, that is good; if not, then start again on the second and third days, until you have entirely scraped;
and know that teeth need various scraping tools, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, because the scrapers used to scrape the surfaces of the teeth have different shapes from those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others be with you prepared.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extracting it as much as possible, for this should not be done at all; for it is a very high substance until there is no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extract, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it to be in the healthy tooth, and causes the good tooth to be extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, as long as the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already attempted to do this to such lords;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth thoroughly with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with subtle pliers in small steps until it is loosened, then firmly grip the pliers; and let the patient's head be in your holy place between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not easily come out, take one of these instruments and gently insert it on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with bandages where the holes are; and hold it gently with pliers so that it does not break when you hold it.
and it is necessary to work very skillfully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the patient with greater pain from the root than the first.
And beware that you do not act like the ignorant and unskilled, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not achieve what we have described.
but sometimes cause great illness from the roots that remain, or from the jaw they break, as we have often seen.
And when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt.
And if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol.
And if this is not sufficient, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth.
And these are the shapes: And let them have large limbs so they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made, strong iron, and toothed to hold the teeth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you should put soaked cotton in butter on the area for one or two days, until the area is softened, then put on the pliers, called "algefri", whose head resembles the beak of a bird;
and let the teeth be made like a file, and this is the form:
And if the roots will not come out with these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and place the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a pick, of which this is the form:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, it is good;
If not, use all the instruments, whose shapes will come after:
And if one uses this instrument that has two blades, of which this is the form: and other tools that are shown in the arrangement of the teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pliers, of which this is the form:
And let these instruments be strong, so that they cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and skillful master finds his instrument himself, according to the works and the illness that shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach an instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks a chariot or other bones, where it might, then look for the instruments that are necessary, that I have told you, and help yourself with the gestures, of which this is the form:
And let them be thick and well-fitting to hold the bone, so it does not escape, but that it can be held and removed;
and then restore the place with medicines appropriate to that, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this whole instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, you must know if the tooth was born after another tooth and is not in the right place, and cannot be filed or smoothed:
Then remove it. and if it is adhered to the tooth, then take this instrument, whose shape is like a small beak, and is made of sharp tempered iron at its tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the other teeth, and if it is evident that it can be filed, file it with a file of this shape:
and is also like the file used to make needles;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move until it falls out;
then smooth it finally with any rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt speech.
When the front teeth ache, either from a blow or from falling, and the patient cannot bite on anything without pain, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it double between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then recommence the covering until the point where you started, and gently and wisely tighten your hand until it does not move;
and let your ligature be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and put it in such a way that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
if it remains and serves thus throughout its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of straightening the two healthy teeth, and the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is repositioned in its place, bit by bit, as we have said;
and no one but the skilled and patient should intervene, and sometimes a tooth form is made from cow's bone, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament, which comes from beneath the tongue by nature, is born this way; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your hand, and lift the tongue;
then cut the nerve ligament widely, so that the tongue is loosened from its attachment, and if there is hardness or knot, and it is from a healed wound, then insert the hook and cut that ligament widely;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery underneath;
and when you have done this, lift the place with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should bathe it every night, so that the wound may not heal.
And if blood flows, place powdered vitriol on the area; and if the wound won't stop bleeding, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see a dark or black or hard discoloration that the patient does not feel, do not touch it, for it is a chancre;
and if it is leaning towards a blister, and there is moisture, insert a lancet, and cut it with a sharp lancet, and release it on both sides; and if the bleeding returns during your work, apply powdered vitriol until it stops, then resume your work until you have drawn all the blood;
then clean the area with wine and oil, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there are boils in the throat, which are called "godath", and these are properly called the two tonsils.  And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and if they are not healed, then beware:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dusky color, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst on its own;
and if it is a whitish, rounded color, and the root is subtle, prepare your instrument for cutting, but first observe whether the abscess is warm and at rest.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head be in your hand, and let the surgeon open the mouth and take the tongue between his hands, and press the tongue beneath the entire instrument, of which this is the form;
and it should be of fine silver or bronze, just like a knife:
When you press the tongue against the instrument and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and place it in the hollow, and pull it firmly upwards as far as you can;
and pull out anything from the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, that resembles a forceps; and nevertheless the tips are bent and one toward the other, and are very sharp, and are made of tempered or hardened iron:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And be sharp on one side and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision the patient gargles with hot, sharp, and mild water, and if a discharge of blood occurs, the patient gargles with water, or with the skins of cooked pomegranates, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds identically.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed within her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and she would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had forced out two nostrils through the two openings of the nose.
I hastened then quickly, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril opening, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
after inserting the lancet into the abscesses, and cut away a portion, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut away from this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess would re-grow, and fill the space that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised it and cauterized it within the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from these parts, and do not know what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When phlegm descends to the eye, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is underneath thick and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not helpful, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is small, then you must cut it.
and the one that is round, gathered and not long; and if it is bloody or a dark colour or black, then you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger upon the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the way I have said, by its colour and length, you must make the patient sit in front of the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention earlier; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you must use a method to relieve the fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp, sharp. And have the patient put their head in your lap, and then press the tongue against the instrument we discussed in the cautery chapter, using a sharp, hot cautery, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the tip of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And have at the head a hollow where medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and apply the instrument to all the medicine on the sore;
and have the patient lying on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine within, so that it does not descend into the throat, and thus heals the wound;
then hold your hand to all the medicine and press it onto the sore for about half an hour, until you see it heal and the burning sensation of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around an instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with the cotton on the wound, so that the cotton adheres to the sore;
and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to re-apply the cautery with the medicine, re-apply it, and after the cautery wipe around the sore with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, rather than cautery;
If it is treated by fumigation according to this method, take chamomile and ysop and oregano and rue and camomile and avronne and similar herbs, and put them all or some of them in a pot, and put water in it, and boil;
and the pot should be tightly sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be a device shaped like this: And it should be of silver or bronze, and one of the ends should be put into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the canal, until the eye is dead;
Then repeat often, until the eye dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, because many things can happen; and do not do this fumigation except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and put a piece of egg shell inside the end so that the mouth of the patient is not too hot; Because the egg shell does not let the vapor burn the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment overall.
Many times, bone or fish spine or some other object gets stuck in the throat;
So you must pull out what you can see, and press the patient's tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you can see the object move;
And what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; Perhaps the object will come out through vomiting;
or if the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a piece of lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take an instrument of lead according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head held high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing be damaged, nor force the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that it is known where the thing is hard; if it pushes down, or he pulls it out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech from the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, after you press his tongue with the instrument I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a very small hook, or with fine tongs that are suitable for this.
And if that doesn't work, take a thin, braided cord, and place it in the sick person's throat, then place a hot iron at the end of the cord, and do this often. And if the sick person is feverish every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, using the instrument that I have mentioned in the fumigation of the eye;
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of the fumigation is that you take a pot where there are burning coals, and let the bottom be covered with a pierced cover, and in that hole is the head of the instrument;
then pour your fumigation into it, and the sick person should put the head of the cane in their mouth, and close their mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall now, and if it does not fall, then restart the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech, if one can see it, is like curved tongs, to allow the mouth to enter the throat; and it resembles the beak of a bird, and has the roughness of a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot leave;
Many are the appearances of abscesses, according to what the memory brings here after from one and the other in this book, and they are diverse in perforation and in cutting;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds moist.
And the second manner is for the places where they are in the body.
For the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy place are different from those that come in the joints, and each has its judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce, until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, like abscesses that are next to joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one lets it rot around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is next to the main limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
where it is next to the foundation, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for those near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, extend inward, and become a fistula; and may not heal in a long time.
And you should know the time for the perforation of a ripe abscess according to completion, and this is when the pain is lessened, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of pain and redness, and the calming and sharpening of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you should place the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears to move.
and the perforation should be along the body's length, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no pleura. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be extended from it, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps the lips and the depth of it will harden.
And if any abscess is pierced according to the width of the body, according to the need of the limb.
And you must apply small abscesses, small holes. and in large abscesses, large holes, and many fissures according to the appearance of the size of the abscess.
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to pierce the core and cut it. when it has become like a flap, and is dormant, then you must do as one does with buboes:
and some are split into three angles, and some are cut like myrtle leaves, like abscesses of the groin;
and some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that do not have a head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not remove all the pus at once, but remove a portion; then bandage the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again; do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is weak, or a woman, or young children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes trembles with the discharge of pus, so that the patient might perhaps die, and you do not notice it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced the abscess, dry the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a wide opening, apply linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must place a tent in each one so that they meet;
and if you have cut a piece of skin in the abscess and you have sewn it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen scraps without moisture and bind it until the third day;
then remove it and treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your work, apply cold water and ease it, and dampen a cloth, and apply it repeatedly to the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, apply remedies and treatments, and the powders I have mentioned in this book, and if it is winter, and the area where the abscess is very sensitive, you must apply tents and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil.
and if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said.
and then drain the abscess and dry it and treat it as necessary until it is healed.
And this is what one should universally know in treating abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed in treating abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where sores on the head come, and there are kinds of them that are like webs, like the yolk of an egg, and many like them.
There are some that are greasy and others where there is moisture like pus;
and some are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery is not opposed to it.
And the work of the cutting is that you test with every instrument called "probe," from which the form comes afterward, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then make a cut over it along the length.
And when the moisture is emptied, then cauterize without leaving any skin containing that moisture, for it often returns when you leave anything behind;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; otherwise, in vinegar and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and that which has remained from the night will drain away.
And then reapply the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know for certain that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a hard lump, then cut it along this form, lengthwise; and there insert your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your efforts to draw the pus out from where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterward.
And also do the same with a stony abscess, and in cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And the cut on a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they contain little blood. And if some of these abscesses, whether on the head or not containing moisture, and this was the abscess that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and found the abscess just like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not be broken; and if anyone had struck it, one would have caused a wound just like that of a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those that come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, in order to let the pus exit;
and treat them as is fitting.
Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are numerous, and are entwined with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own cavity, just like the tumor and abscess of the head, as we have said; And the forms of these scrofulas are many.
And the forms of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and some that are malignant and do not wish to obey health.
In that one, then, which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar to the color of the body, and smooth on every side and is not inflamed on the nerves of the neck or the artery or the conduit, and is not deep;
Then you must cut it from above, and scrape it on every side, and spread the two lips of the wound with the forceps, if you need them, just as we have said for abscesses of the head;
And draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the spatula is not sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, then put vitriol powder, or some powders that stop blood, into the wound, and tighten the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work until you complete it;
Then look with your index finger if any small scabs remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein in the root of the scab, you should not cut that scab at its root, but tie a strong double thread around it and let it fall off by itself without harming it;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring the two edges of the wound together and stitch them now, since there is no excess left due to the size of the scab. You must then proceed to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
You must then proceed to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that hold excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it thus, as the one previously mentioned, by depending, and then apply dressings with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; And when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with ointment that promotes flesh, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the throat's incision; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those with squinancy, it is necessary that the slit in the throat, called the "epiglottis," be healed; and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the flesh of the sick person are affected by those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary then, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four small circles, a small cut across, between the two circles or by the amount of the surface cut, not into the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis that there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is fearful, then it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat to its full extent, and then cut it until he reaches the channel; and drain the vessels of blood, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the cutting of the phlegm from the channel which jumps out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed for which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound in the heart, and stitch it entirely without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breathing is failing. Then the epiglottis is cut, so that the patient cannot breathe, and they breathe through the wound, and thus are saved from death;
and for this the ancients ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or four. And then they ordered to sew up the wound and treat it until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a lady took a knife and stuck it into her throat and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or artery, but only the throat, and air was escaping through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the lady suffered only that she was hoarse-voiced, and returned to her normal disposition.
Therefore I say that there should be no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "gullet hernia," and is a large abscess, the color of a jaundice, and is very common in women;
and it is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no device.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat within us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery within us; and if there is fear, and it is not fitting to work with strong things except in the small one, and you must test and search throughout the internal parts: if you find it just like fat, and it does not connect to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts fat, and pull it out completely, if there is any. and carefully search everywhere, and treat it as is proper, until it is completely healed.
Many kinds of fat there are, of which I will describe all the varieties;
and it is necessary that I describe all the difference that exists between fat and issue.
I say that issue is heat and fever causing, until the boiling is over, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With fat, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it contains a surface, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either oily or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of fat, that you first test and inquire into all the instrument called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of inquiry into the abscesses of fat is that you take the moistest place you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then according to the size of the abscess;
then pull out the instrument, and be careful of what jumps out.
If moisture runs, what color it has, then lance it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if after the instrument no moisture comes, know that it is fat, then lance it in a cross shape, and take it with tweezers, and slightly scrape it from each side and watch the skin where it lies, so you pull it out healthy with the fat;
and if you cannot pull it out whole, then pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the pus returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, constrict the wound, and put soothing things on a hot abscess, and cure it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the pus is large, then stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with those that generate flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, then hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound rots and the blood boils cease; then return to cauterizing what remains of the night.
See here the shapes of the instruments for inserting, and they are of three types: large and medium and small;
and of these there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and of these there are three types: large, medium, and small, for searching abscesses of fistulas;
and they are like the needles with which one sews pouches, and they are of yellow copper, or iron, or silver, and the yellow ones are more effective, and they are more tested by black lead for searching the edges of fistulas;
and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the amount of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many kinds, as you see here:
and there are probes which have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are probes which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes which have two curves, and probes of only one curve, and they are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, which are cut, is sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, so that they scrape the skin, so that the vein or nerve is not cut;
and among these instruments are lancets fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them when opening abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are used only on fleshy parts, such as legs, arms, breasts, and the groin, and similar places;
and sometimes a small instrument is made, resembling the peels of nuts, according to this form, with which to staunch blood: and it is placed sometimes at the place that bleeds from cuts of veins and arteries, and sometimes again according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they appear like women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them must do so according to this form of this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast inclines downward, and is softened by its size as happens to women, then split it into two sections above, through two similar cuts; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, such that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form, from this line .b. up to the line .g.; then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and whatever is necessary for the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas where there are lumps, and some contain moisture.
Those, then, that contain moisture should be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulas, then open it as we have said in opening scrofulas, and if the wound returns pus, then apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above is stitched, abscesses often result, and likewise it happens to a swollen vein and an abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, then the abscess is long and deep. and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening.
and when it is due to the vein, the signs are clearly apparent.
And it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and many other places, and is very large. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid iron treatment, and the one who is at the head should also avoid it, and in the one that is of arterial swelling, a puncture should be made through the skin along it.
Then open the incision with lancets, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
Then place a needle underneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
Then puncture the area between the two ligatures with an instrument until the blood that is there comes out, and let the abscess be released.
Then apply the treatment that produces suppuration, until the ligature falls off; Then treat it with the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is near the vein's incision, then you should hold the area of the abscess from the skin all around, then place the needle under the part you hold, pierce it, and insert a double thread, so you pull it through from the other side; Then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or tie the thread at one of the two ends of the thread;
And if you doubt that the thread will not hold, then insert another needle all along the thread, under the entire abscess, to the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
Then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the center and leave what is tied;
Then place a moistened cloth in wine and oil, then administer cures of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the arteries and veins, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or through excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in several conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but below the heart;
and it moves well from all sides, and does not go forward or backward, or below or above, and that which is in the joints does not need to be cut with a knife: perhaps there would be contraction; and that which is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin to the bone.
and that which is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin to the bone. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the abdomen and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them. Its root is subtle, and its head large.
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his abdomen that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference. They were white, had fine roots, were slightly cracked, and often had moisture running from them.
I cut them open and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other.  The procedure is that you look to see if the patient is moist and the color of the lump is white and moist, with a subtle root. If the lump is wide, have the cautery iron at hand.
If the lump is wide, have the cautery iron at hand. For when cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hurry to cauterize.
And if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread and bind the lump as we have said, and leave it for two days.
And then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the lump and it breaks off without effort.
And if the roots are large, there is fear of cutting even the belly, but you may well cut half of it and then cauterize it so that it will not return.
Then cure the wound, and take care not to cut the lump which is of a fixed color, and of poor sense, and of milky appearance.
For it is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of the ulcer later.
When the boil is fully If the appearance of a boil comes from a wound or a cut on the surface, and is on the belly, and some boils emerge, as happens in other openings, or from blood that flows from veins or arteries, as described before, or from windiness;
And if it is from a break in the surface and through the discharge of the boil, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, it is a slight thing without pain, and it has diverse discharge. And if it is due to the discharge of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when you press it with your fingers, it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is hardened, and it grows a lot at the entrance to the bath and from hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, and it does not constrict.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, with these signs, and it is fixed according to a quantity. And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind.
And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, due to the artery and due to the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie completely straight, then make incisions all around the wound. Then have him lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have incised with a spatula, then extend the half of the abscess upwards on the large incision; then bind it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be free from the bandage.
Then open the half of the abscess stretched over the bandage, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine. If you find it caught in the bandage, untie it, and push the intestine out of the belly.
And if you find the bowel, grasp it with the forceps and cut off the excess.
And if the artery or vein is causing you trouble, go carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads through them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you pierced.
Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall off by itself. Or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said.
Or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said. And drain the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and close it.
About a sore. We have discussed the types of sores, and how one should treat them with medicines, and how one should avoid using iron in treatment.
And we say that a sore develops in the armpit, and great care is needed in its treatment.  The ancients said that when a sore is in a place where it can be scraped away, such as a sore on the breasts or the thigh, and similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning stages.
No one has ever cured one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes.
Then let the patient bleed if there is obvious fullness, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the treatment.
Then remove your instruments, or the chancre, and the hair from everywhere, and the bone from everywhere without leaving anything.
And let the blood run freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding makes the incision to the artery or vein difficult, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped. Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the various forms of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, the signs of each form, and the treatments using medicines and those using iron:
and one should not use iron in these two forms: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarches, for it is a deadly matter;
Therefore, when you treat this form of dropsy called "ecchymosis" with medicines, and the treatment does not work, observe if the patient is weak or has another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea or similar conditions; if not to use iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see a patient of strong constitution, and they have only dropsy as an illness, and they are neither too young nor too old, you should work thus: Lift the patient straight into your hands, and the minister should press the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest; then take the spatumile spine according to this form: And let it be sharpened on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it could reach the intestines when inserted, and not cause injury;
Then see if the dropsy is lodged towards the intestines: If so, you must cut into the belly in three straight lines below the knife; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, your incision should be on the left side of the belly, three lines;
and if it is due to the spleen, it should be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the fluids do not flow to that weak place;
Then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and remove it, and lift your hand through all the tissue between the skin and the surface, as if skinning, to the extent of a fingernail or a little more;
Then pierce the surface until the tissue reaches the empty space, and that is the place of the water, then remove the fluid, and place this instrument, whose shape is like this: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is of bronze or light iron, and has a small hole at the bottom part; and on the other side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision, like the way a scribe cuts a feather:
at the top of the head is the spout, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument;
then empty it by half or a third, for if you empty it more than is appropriate at that moment, perhaps the patient will die due to the resolution of his spirit from the weapon, or he will fall unconscious, or he approaches death;
but empty it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's power signify, and his pulse;
then pull the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart that stops the opening that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then recommence the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and be careful not to overdo it so that only a little water remains.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave a lot of water, then cure him with hot sand or a hot bath, and with a lot of sweating or bathing and sunbathing, and let him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, then pierce it immediately with a very fine needle according to this form:
then put a fine lead plug into the opening, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wishes to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then put it back in;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes to flow does not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small, if treated with the lead plug, as we have said, will get larger.
Those whose opening is not in its place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the top of the penis, so they cannot urinate until they raise their penis. and cannot ejaculate because the matter cannot reach the testicles, and this is a bad illness.
And the method of the work is that the patient lies often on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it as if it were the size of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as is necessary;
and be careful of the bleeding that comes many times, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the sores on the penis Many times these ulcers appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
so you should take them with a sharp instrument, and cut and clean them all, then put on moistened cotton in Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant, of foul color and foul-smelling, then you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is on the shaft, and part of it is within the skin and part outside, you must first remove the part of the ulcer that is inside. and when it is healed, treat the part outside.
For when you treat it together, the shaft of the penis is not assured of not being pierced, and blackness and corruption arise in the shaft and the testicles.
You must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and chickpeas, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps two conditions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
And if the shaft of the penis is corrupt and withdrawn, you must put a lead pipe into the shaft of the penis, and the patient should urinate through it.
And when the skin around the head of the penis (which happens to those who have not been circumcised), or it happens due to a wound or an abscess, you must then cauterize it with a sharp instrument, until the bond is broken, and the shaft of the penis is released from all sides.
And if it is a serious matter to discuss this, you must cauterize with a spatula a small part of the head of the penis and the skin.
Then carefully separate between the two, and place a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, so that it doesn't burn again.
Circumcision is not simply the breaking of continuity like other wounds; However, when we perform this work of our own accord, and properly on children, it is necessary that we do the best and least harmful work.
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their children, because they did not use it in their laws, and we only know what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and nobles who performed circumcision using a knife, and by force, and with a new sharp blade;
If the heart fled, because there are two veins, and perhaps one above is cut, leaving the one below. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the cleansing of the knife, the tip of the limb is not ensured.
And with the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen it.
From the cleansing done by force, throughout the whole thread of the fiber, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the force cuts justly both above and below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in all directions at once. But let the thread be tightly wrapped around the leather;
And the manner of the first work is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and then you can make him enjoy it in all the ways that you can.
Then hold it straight between your hands, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child cannot see them, nor any of the instruments.
Then put your hand on the rod and blow into the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the rod is inside. Then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it beneath one loop to the other.
Then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it beneath one loop to the other. And hold it with your two fingers by the second tied loop with your thumb and index finger, and cut between the two loops, then lift the heart quickly and pull the head of the rod. Then let the blood run drop by drop, for this is the cure. And put powder on it, and over the powder a layer of glue made from a beaten egg mixed with rose water, mixed with good, fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
The form of forces for cleansing is this:
The two blades should be thin and sharp, and the blades should also be as large as the handle, evenly.
The error in the cleansing is when the heart is in the incision.
Then you should extend it to your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess.
And cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your fingernail, hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is under the rod is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the rod; it will not hurt it at all.
Then treat the area with substances suitable for wound powders, as we have discussed in treating powders, and if one cuts too deeply into the heart, and it goes above, it will do no harm.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by blockage of a stone, or congealed blood, or phlegm, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck or bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and the patient should extend their abdomen from the part above the back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
And it should be of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And let the tube be a palm and a half long, and slender at the tip.
And the method for releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe.
And cut off the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit down, and anoint the bladder and penis with moist oil, olive oil, and warm water.
Then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double the penis above towards the scrotum;
Then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient feels it coming to the empty space, and this is not done according to this order frequently, because the channel through which it passes is twisted;
Then pull out the thread with all the wool bit by bit, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and make the urine flow.
And repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When burns or blood come into the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you wish to distill there vinegar and medicines, do it to the whole instrument which is called "clepsydre," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three holes: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they well seal off the pipe without addition, so that one may draw out the moisture, and put in when necessary;
And when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the funnel into the moisture, and draw out what is inside;
So you will draw out the moisture into the funnel, and then forcefully push the contents back in; Then the moisture will enter, and come to the bladder now, so that the patient will feel it;
And that is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of pewter, and the head is higher;
and underneath by the breast where the ligament falls;
Then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder in it, then tie it between the two breasts with a double good thread, and heat the moisture a little over the fire;
Then put the head of the clyster into the tube, then hold your hand over the bladder with all the moisture arriving, until the patient feels that the moisture has come to the bladder;
And if you do not have the bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle of it, and pierce it roundly around; Then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle like one assembles a tile, and put inside it what you wish of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
And do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
Of the stone
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, and the extraction along with the medicines;
and have stated the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in what stones one should operate with a chisel; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder more often occur in children, and this is a sign that the water seeps from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety;
and there appears sand, and the patient rubs his penis, and it often hangs down, and then stiffens; and from much of this seepage, the foundation weakens;
and the cure is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in the elderly, and is moderate in young people, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the filth that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the quest for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes rises from the upper part of the place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downward;
then seek for and touch it within;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hasten now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall out when touched completely, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a mature youth; and put it in his fundament, and seek for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and bring it to the exterior where you wish to cut.
And command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend his right hand towards the testicles upwards, and with his left hand remove the skin below the testicles in the part where the incision is made;
then place the scalpel there, whose shape is this: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the fundament, not in the middle but to the side of the left groin;
and let it be straight over the stone, and your fingers be constantly on the fundament, and let the incision be in a transverse manner so that it is wide on the exterior and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure of your finger on the fundament will make it jump out without effort;
and know that there are stones with angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, resembling a ball, and round, from which removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not move, you must use pliers that are like a file on the head, to grip the stone so it does not slip away; or you insert an instrument, subtle and curved at the head;
and if you cannot grasp it thus, enlarge the hole a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first remove the largest one to the bladder's neck, then cut above it, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards, if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be softened, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine comes out constantly because the opening cannot close;
but nevertheless, try to pull it out, or break it with pliers, until you pull it out piece by piece;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place a wet cloth soaked in oil and wine, or oil and rose water and cold water, over it to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, thoroughly wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear in the wound, and corrosion, and clotting of blood in the bladder, and the urine is thereby retained, which is recognized in such a manner that without discharge with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will rot the bladder and cause it to decay;
then cleanse the wound with water, and vinegar, and salt, and assist him in every way that you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, that you tie his two thighs together, and gather the medicines over the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the channel of the penis, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot escape; If you treat it as I have described, that you cut it many times, are you excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron implement according to this shape, and let it have three angles fixed in a shape of a firebrand.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder.
Then insert the implement into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone. and turn the implement in your hand on the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
Then the urine will come out immediately, then press your hand on that which is left of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the spot of the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and cleanse the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is implanted in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is prohibited for three reasons:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to the examination, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman skilled in this art of the hands;
And the fourth reason is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's, which requires a deeper incision, and there is much fear involved. And if necessity dictates this, then you must take a knowledgeable woman, and it is difficult to find one.  If you cannot find one, then seek a subtle, skilled female doctor;
and present a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command of the stone's examination; and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the base and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she must hold it under her finger, and instruct her to place her finger where the disease is, and seek and press her left hand firmly upon the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut onto the stone at the root of the thigh opposite the middle of the groin, where it appears movable, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then place the rod into the incision, if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can exit easily, and know that many kinds of stones exist:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ridges.
if you know the appearances to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, place powdered vitriol on the area, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work until the stone is out, and have instruments as I have told you for the extraction of stones, have men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overwhelms you, and it is an artery that is cut, put the powder on the area and bind it with cloths and bandages, and do not begin again with this, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die. then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the area is better, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus beneath the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "pus," and sometimes it is properly in the shell of the egg, so that one might think it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this does not happen often. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colours: where it is a colour declining to yellowness, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often.
and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is as white as we have said, the abscess is round, not very long, like the shape of an egg, and the testicles are not visible, because there is moisture all around them.
And if it has moisture in the proper tissue, the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of that, one thinks it is another egg.
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well.
Therefore, when you want to know the colour of the moisture, you test the entire cavity, of which the shape is shown before. According to this, then, which comes after the cavity, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be made healthy according to their ability and the fullness of their body.
then lay them on their back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath them;
then sit on their left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
then take the spatula and cut the skin of the testicles along the length from beside the dagger, and let your cut be perfectly straight, separating the skin of the testicles until white skin is visible, and peel it carefully to the best of your ability;
then pierce the flat surface of water with one large hole, and remove all the water, and then apply your hooks, and stretch the surface upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; cut it all or in pieces, precisely on its side, for if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return;
and if the egg springs out during your work, then replace it in its place once you have completed the work on the surface;
then stitch together the two edges of the testicles’ heart with a stitch, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are supporting it, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all its supporting structure, and remove the egg, and treat it as we have described.
And if an acute pain is assembled into two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe the blood away, and place wool soaked in rose oil on the wound;
then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe the blood away, and place wool soaked in rose oil on the wound; and place more wool soaked in wine and oil over the two testicles, and place doubled cloths over them, and tie it all up in a bandage according to this shape:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool strips according to this appearance, and sew them together at the crotch of the breeches, and one should be placed over the bottom to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two hips, and let the whole binding be gathered together in the loop of the bracer;
And sometimes this cautery is used in place of an iron incision, and you should take a thin cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface containing the moisture is exposed;
Then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, sharp cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you remove all of it;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more beneficial; and take care of the flow of blood, and avoid the work of cutting;
and if anything opposes you, whether it be an abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else, then treat whatever opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not wish to undergo this work because of its horror, then administer a perforation, as I tell you, and when you are certain through the signs we have mentioned that the watery humour is gone, then make the patient sit upon a raised seat; then pierce the abscess on the under part, through the whole of the substance, and place the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water runs out;
then place cotton on the area and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the linen bandage does not allow the water to exit from the wound's opening, then you must insert a reed or an instrument with which water is drawn from hydrops, whose shape is described earlier;
and enlarge the wound's opening, and know that the water returns, and is gathered after six months or thereabouts, and when it is gathered as before, then the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the section of this branch there is fear in many dispositions, for which reason it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come upon the body, and especially to the testicles; and it is by many a case.
That is to say, by a superfluity of sharp and acute matter, which is spread to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and does not find any pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps it is a grievous, fearful and stony abscess, of a dark color, and sometimes it comes from a rupture of an artery, or from the swelling of a vein.
When it is from a rupture of an artery, it is recognized by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made from a swelling of a vein is recognized by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this kind, and on the other tissues; and it is that you cut the root of the testicles, then lift the testicle upwards, and pull the white sac away, and release the suspensory ligament from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with these born tissues, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and cut it;
And if it is airy on the surface, or in that which is within the vessels, then you must release all that tension and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the tissue is in the rear area, then you must cut it all, and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this illness is just as difficult as the previous one, and nevertheless, we will tell you about its treatment, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory for the testicles down by your fingers, at all the vessels close to the penis, and the master should hold them, and stretch them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide spatula, cut through the area across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape from each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then insert a needle where there is a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and remove the corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound as the others where pus forms, so that no vessel bursts and nourishes either testicle.
For by this, no harm comes; and if pus comes to all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed from all the vessels. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this ailment is by the severance that occurs at the symphysis, or the stretching on the abdomen in the groin region, so that the intestines descend from this rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is of the symphysis, or from its stretching, and these two types arise from many causes:
or from a blow, or from a jump, or from a fall, or from lifting a heavy load, and by similar things;
And the signs when it is from the stretching of the symphysis are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal all the way down, because the symphysis presses on the intestines.
And the signs when it is from a section of the symphysis are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear differently, under the skin close by, and this is because of the issue of the intestines and the body pushing away from the symphysis.
And sometimes the bowels descend with the intestines, and are caught, and cause great suffering to the patient, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, so it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into the wound with his hand, if he can. then be held up on his neck, between your hands, and lift the thighs;
then stretch the heart upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert the scissors of the waist according to what you need to open the wound, and be such that the pus can exit;
then scrape the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white surface that is beneath the skin of the testicle, and the second surface, and separate that which is behind the testicle, and between the second surface;
and then pull with your right hand into the heart of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the waist; and instruct the attendant to extend the testicle upwards, and loosen that which is behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, put it into the abdomen underneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of multiple threads, and place it in the back part of the surface, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends appearing from the threads until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the shape of a cross, and bind the surface, which we have said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and bandage them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels nourishing them can enter, and a festering abscess does not come; and put the bandage again, along the first bandage, to a length of two fingers, and after these two bandages, leave the surface of the area beneath the skin of the testicles the width of one finger; and after all the other, according to the roundness that the egg bears;
then cut in the part under the skin of the testicles, as long as the blood runs, and the swelling, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and administer the bandage that we have said. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, due to fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be bathed with warm water, and place upon it what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this section, I have never seen anyone dare to perform the cure with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the section that is along the vein, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the cut above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of what opens, until the vessel drains;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the arteries, as we have said, and the wound opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the vagina, and if any do descend, it is little, and it repairs itself every hour;
and nevertheless, if it remains too long in this state, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens due to the extension of the ulcer that is on the arteries, as we have said, for it is extended, then softened and swollen, and the wound is open;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on their back between your hands, then cut the area of the ruptured flesh with a wide blade according to the amount of three fingers;
and then remove the ulcer that is under the skin, then take the thread and place it on the exposed area of the ulcer;
and press it deep into the abdomen, then sew the two visible parts of the ulcer onto the head of the thread, and sew one and the other;
then pull out the head of the thread, and do not cut the ulcer nor stretch it nor anything else, as I have made you aware in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The ulcer is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cauteries are milder in this place, and closer to salvation.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the tissues within are softened, and it is noticeable.
And it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one lays the patient on his back, and cuts the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess of the softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed and the thread falls out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the person should know how to respond when questioned, and to know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chastise certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that chastisements are done in two ways: or by pulling, or by splitting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, so that the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are restored and you feel them no more.
Of the castration of the tail: You must restrain the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut each testicle with one cut, after you have properly scorched them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface that is above the vessels;
and this method of castration is gentler than that done by traction, because in traction perhaps some part of the testicles remains, so that the beast desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two types in men: one is where between the two testicles appears also the figure of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine is discharged there.
And the other type is in women, and has a penis like a rod and two testicles.
And the treatment of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second type, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is an added flesh on the natural part, as long as it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You should cut off the excess tentigene with your hand or shears, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood occur, then treat it with another treatment until it is healed;
and another flesh that arises from the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and is like a boil, and for this the ancients called it "boil disease. If necessary, cut it, as we have said of the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is born of nature, or an accident caused by the disease that has arrived there;
and is born of nature, or an accident caused by the disease that has arrived there; or it is by added flesh, or of subtle or thick surface, and is made deep within the womb, or in the ribs, or beneath, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the possibility of flowers (children);
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the womb.
If the numbness is readily apparent, seek it with your fingers or a stick.
If it is of a subtle surface, and it is close to the two lips, hurry, and do it like this:
Place your two index fingers together, and the woman be on her back, her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, so that the subtle surface is round, and the numbness is relieved;
then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie on her back every day so that it cannot fester.
And if the surface is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatula, similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is of newly formed flesh, then suspend it from a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stop the blood, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, and a mixture of egg whites.
then apply a broad lead band so that the wound cannot fester.
and let it be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen.
then be treated with further remedies until healed.
And when a dead flesh appears in the wound, it must be cut away in this manner, unless it is infected abscesses. For a festering abscess in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become hard.
And we have already discussed their types, their signs, and now I will describe those that receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and hard swellings, when deeply seated in the wound, and not apparent to touch, are not curable with iron.
Those that are at the opening of the wound, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you should place the woman in a cool room, then grasp the swelling with pincers and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle medicinal powders that restrain blood, such as alum, dragon's blood, and incense, and similar substances;
then bind her feet to the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood results, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate bark, gallnuts, and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster for her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply leeches to her back and breasts without hurting them;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and the one called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough boil, so it must be cut like I said, the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscess come in the groin, such as chancre and stony abscess and herpes and styes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
Therefore, it is necessary for me to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes in the groin, which is not of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, look if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its arrival, and full of heat and fever, and if it turns red, if you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce, but let it mature until the pain is relieved;
and then have the sick person sit on a seat, and let him have two small seats where he leans, and support him on his back and bring his feet together towards the back of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread out, and let him place his arms beneath his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck the pus towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the wound, of which the shape comes afterwards;
and it is necessary that when you wish to apply this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the wound, so that what enters the instrument does not go too deep, and does not harm the sick person; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the wound with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and it is incised with a soft hand, it must be cut at the head, at the base of the pus;
And when the pus is emptied, it is necessary that you place moistened tents in rose oil, or in dry green oil, in the wound;
and place the tent deep in the wound, and place over the wound and over the incision clean wool soaked in water or in boiled mallows;
then treat it after two days of appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes the pus and the wound are cleaned with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or boiled roots of lilies and long aristolochies; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is filled with pus, you must avoid using an iron cautery, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the nature of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to emerge; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and the issue is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child emerges quickly;
for when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth emerges with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and the body or the head, or the hands, or it comes upon its belly, or sometimes, and is turned perhaps upon its neck, and by other bad figures;
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these things, and to beware of error and deceit, and I will show you all the figures how one should help her.
If the infant comes upon its head through natural delivery, and the woman labors hard, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a chair, or the women hold her;
and apply her nature of oil or fennel seed that is cooked, and then let the midwife place the small spatula, of which the form is like this: and cut the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture within it flows out;
and grasp the woman's abdomen until the infant descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema to the woman of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her drink and sneeze with condiment, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the infant will come out now.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, then you must gently realign them little by little; and if they cannot re-enter, place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upward; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman, so that she does not fall when it lowers;
and if the hands cannot re-enter, and the infant dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is previously mentioned, and remove the infant, and realign it equally.
of the infant's exit onto its feet When the child comes onto its feet, then it must be pushed upward; and then turn it slowly, until it is aligned;
then take it by the feet and extend it slowly.
If it jumps up to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze by conditioning; if it jumps free, if God wills.
And if it does not jump free, as we have said, then turn it slowly, until it is in its natural shape. For then it is light.
And if it does not jump free as we have said, then take linen cloth, and oil of cypress, and melted gum, and grind it all in a mortar; and put on the woman's nature on the wound and apply this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to under the ribs;
and when she is softened beneath, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and put it beneath, and leave it an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and gently grip her stomach, because the child jumps out now.
from the issue of the child onto her knees When the child comes into this form, the midwife puts her hands gently on it; then it should be supported on her neck, and her legs hang down, and it should be lying on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then take her hands on her stomach, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is prepared to deliver; and if the child does not come out, then take its legs and move them forcefully, then move the stomach upward, then put your hands on it; and draw the child out gently; and tell the woman to push as hard as the child comes out.
of the child's birth that comes out with one hand hanging down it is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back. if it cannot be brought back, have the woman get up and leave.
if she cannot walk, have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly.
then administer the lotion that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the seat, then try to bring the hand back. and examine the child according to its natural form, and make it sneeze, and tell it to strain until the child comes out.
from the child's exit on its mother's neck, and have its hands spread out, and its face turned toward its mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold its hand, then turn it gently, little by little, and examine it lightly.
and when it is equal, place the natural mucous substance of elder and oil upon it, as we have said, then tell her to move gently, little by little;
and when you have done this, make her sit on the seat, and tell her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire afterbirth
in this same manner for the entire afterbirth When it comes to be like this for the entire afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs from its face and neck, cut it from the base, so it is not held back, and the child dies;
then place the child inside, until you have put it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take care of herself:
of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it seldom happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all.
Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all. I know that they are multiple, and are separated by a membrane that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge just as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they emerge with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and quickly and gently do what she must; and do it in a way that leads to their health. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the manner of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more, up to fifteen, and they are completely formed in the manner of a child by the measurement of the wise and glorious, and it is necessary for the midwife to know all this, because perhaps similar things will happen to her. so do what is appropriate.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come forth, and you are constrained to manual work; if it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister shall hold her in two parts, or she be bound to the bed so that she is not pulled in the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the child with moist oils with a mixture of althea and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the child's hands with these oils and these mixtures;
then place them lightly in the child's mouth, then seek a place where to place the forceps appropriate to this, and watch if the child is positioned so it descends on its head;
if you place the forceps in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the ribs, and if the descent is on its feet, then place them in the groin and near the ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the forceps in his right hand, and place the curve between his fingers of the left hand, and gently place it with his whole hand, and place the forceps in any of these places we have said, until it comes to the empty thing;
then place the other forceps, or the third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then extend it equally by moving it from one side to the other, in order to pull it out, and let the forceps be toothed to hold the thing, just as here is the shape:
And if a part remains, then oil the tips of some of his fingers with oil, and put them in that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part remains, then place this forceps in a higher position, and do this until it comes out completely.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be brought back due to constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it comes out completely; then cut at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or if it has a sharp point assembled, you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the point and remove the point; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach," of which the form comes with the instruments or chapter that is after this one;
and thus do the same if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull out the bones with pliers, and if the head is stuck fast and is trapped by force, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the pus escapes;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces in the manner that you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the moisture flows.
And if the child is on its feet, the traction is slight, and the straightening towards the mouth of the wound is slight.
And if it is tight in the belly or in the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and cut the belly or breast until the moisture within flows out;
and if the other members are removed, and the head remains, the attendant puts their hand deep into the wound and pulls it towards the opening of the wound; then puts one or two hooks in it and pulls forcefully;
and if the opening of the wound is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has formed there, one should not exert effort, but rather apply moist and fatty substances; and apply plasters, and soak in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it upright, apply what we have said for a living child;
and if one cannot, pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said concerning hot abscesses that appear in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood comes, it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman whose belly had contained a dead child, then another was sewn on top of that, and the other died as well. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and swelled until it opened, and began to greatly discharge pus.
I was called to treat it, and pondered it a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days another. I was very surprised, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little bit of pus would come out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, he should know how to provide help.
Here after comes the form of the presser, with which books were made;
and at two turns, with two ends of the two strings. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger's width, and the margin of the wood one finger, and in length one and a half palms; and between the two strings should be two joints of this same tube, which are fastened to one and the other, of half a palm in length, or a little more;
and these two joints are placed in the mouth of the mortise to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar in appearance but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling pliers; and have two joints at the two ends, as you see, one palm long and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the mortise with the entire instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs spread, then put the two joined joints together into the mortise, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then move your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the pliers, according to the extent you want to open the mouth of the mortise, until the patient does as she wishes.
These instruments are all topped, and their appearances are multiplied; and when the mire has prepared them, the work is thus quicker, and more difficult for men because of their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the secondine is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a stimulus, and press your hands to her mouth and nose. And if she coughs because of this, so much the better.
If not, she takes a pot, and makes a hole in the cover, and puts herbs that can open the mouth of the ailment, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, are boiled in water over the fire;
then put one end of the pipe in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the ailment, and hold it until the vapors go into the ailment;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out quickly, instruct the woman to wet her left hand in oil of sesame or in the juice of elder, and then put it in the area, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, then she should gently pull it out straight, so that the ailment does not get damaged during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and left, and then pulled; then it will come out and separate.
And if the opening of the ailment is tight, we have described the treatment for sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not cured by all that we have said, then be careful not to overdo it in pulling;
but it is necessary to tie whatever is at the opening of the ailment to the woman's thigh, then use a clyster of four-herb ointment; if it will rot and be set right, and will become whole;
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
None of the ancients have tested fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is like a chain, and one puts the fine end in the nature, and the wide ends on the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the disease until it is gone, and start another.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but rather have a small stopper. Then it is necessary for the nurse to pierce that stopper with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp point, and keep the bandage from touching it.
Then place moistened wool in wine and oil, then apply ointment until healed.
And if you doubt that it will re-stop up, place a lead chain in the hole and leave it in place for several days, and remove it when the child wants to go to the chambers.
And sometimes these stoppages come from the healing of a wound or abscess. If so, that closure must be cut. If it is treated, as we have said of the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and growths that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, there is one fistula or several.
And when that swelling is old, it opens, and still discharges a whitish or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And they are known by this, that from them comes either excretion or wind when the patient excretes, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce down to the bladder, and down to the middle of the penis; and they reach down to the hip joint, and down to the bone of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes the penetrating fistula at the fundament, and not just the non-penetrating one: and it is that you place your index finger at the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair against your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening with expulsion of wind or matter, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate at all; so hurry to cure it.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the passage of urine, urine leaks out, and cannot be sealed by medicine.
If it has pierced to the joint of the thigh, the swelling extends to the spot; if there is no twisting and the pain is localized around it, it often forms a boil, and neither medicine nor ointment will help to heal it.
and in these piercing fistulas there is no cure but labor, and the foolishness of the meddling quacks.
In one that is not piercing and is not old, there is hope for health through iron, as I have proven, and the patient must lie on their back between your hands;
and lift the legs up to the thighs, and have the thighs inclined towards the stomach; then place a lead or tin tent, if there is twisting, until you know where the tent touches.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, you should put your index finger there, then feel that the tent has pierced it.
and if you feel either skin or flesh between your finger, then you know it is piercing. if not, work on it until it can be healed.
They say however that some can be healed well, but this is rare.
And the help that is given is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before. and puts it hot into the fistula, until it comes next to the bottom. and do this two or three times, until you know that these false flesh have been burned, which are like a bird's feather.
and then cure with tents soaked in butter, until that flesh comes away, then cure with ointment that creates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If this, in no other way can be healed;
and if the tent goes in, and does not pierce to the finger which is at the foundation, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at this that followed the covering of the heart; if you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and fall;
then cleanse those displaced flesh that appear like a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For the cauteries of fire bring together two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat the wet tents with butter or crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments strong and lasting, firm flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes right down to the bottom, and is far from the body, then put your finger in the bottom and feel it.
If you feel the tent, and between it is the cloth or the surface or flesh, where it is close to piercing, there should be no more than a way of hope and expectation, through the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it all the way through, or if you can, put tents in it and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tissue holding the bottom, and the expulsion come from there against your will; then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you separate that covering and cleanse it since it is cut away from the bottom, either by a tent or by another appropriate instrument; then cleanse that bruised flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study how to restore the wound, and how to keep the fistula in the part outside the bottom:
then study how to restore the wound, and how to keep the fistula in the part outside the bottom: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the bottom next to the skin above, then take a pierced tent at the head according to this form: And put one thread in two, and put the tent with all the thread in the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing in the margin of the bottom inside, then extract the thread from that hole, as you put your finger in the bottom;
and pull the head of the thread, and assemble the two heads together, and bind one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep within. For it is not necessary to make the incision so deep, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spine spatula with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and trenchant. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two types: or they are within the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and often blood flows from them, and there is one or several, and they are under the fundament and at the top of the fundament;
but those that are under have little moisture, and often a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them within the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the chamber pot, until the fundament issues forth, and the fibers appear; if you hurry, and you grip it with pincers, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the forceps cannot hold them due to their moisture, then grasp them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamelot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that are in the place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then administer a biting and harsh clyster to the patient to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out openly; If the patient endures, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light;
If the patient endures, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light; and you should take them with your nail or pliers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision with iron. Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then place a soaked compress on rose oil or a cerate, and place it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then let it be until they heal, and when they are healed, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are sound.
of the drying of the wound Many times there is a drying of the intestines, and through constriction of the nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary, scrape the surface with the point of a spatula or your fingernail, so that it does not become damp. then treat it until it is healed as is appropriate.
and if it cannot heal, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it bleeds considerably and is scraped raw. then treat it until it is healthy.
doubly shakes Formice is a small, deceptive appearance around the body, and goes very deep.
and sometimes one finds cold, and feels it as if shivering, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a stick of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick upon the shivering, so that the circle surrounds the shivering entirely. then turn your hand around the whole stick so that you cut around the shivering, and put it deep, and remove the shivering from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of bronze or iron, according to this shape, and let it be thin underneath and pointed above. not piercing, so as to hold and press the fingers.
And if you wish, cauterize the shivering, as is before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes one makes a clyster of silver or gold, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes one makes them small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those, then, that are administered to children and those who are weak and sorrowful are small.
Those, then, that are administered to children and those who are weak and sorrowful are small. The form of the small and large clyster is, therefore, wider at the top, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there is a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the bottom is pierced;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly where medicines are placed be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have between each hole one space, then put into these holes a strong thread of coarse thread twisted in an X or spiral shape, and assemble the belly as if it were a goatskin; and when the medicine is inside, tie it with a strong thread to the instrument in front, then administer the clyster;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then introduce it gently; then the minister squeezes it with his two hands together, until it is all empty, then remove the clyster, and the patient raises his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wishes to come out, he should hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is even greater help.
And if you clyster him for a disease of a running belly, and the medicine hurries to come out, then repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, then the clyster should be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster whereby the skin is compressed:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures of hands and medicine, according to the accomplishment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made of, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of stones, and the cutting of swords and knives, or of lances or staves or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places on the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple head wounds, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, be careful if it is from the throwing of stones or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you doubt the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be opposite the injured part;
and keep the patient from fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if it does not want to bleed, let its food be lessened, and let it drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put over the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put over the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not changed by the air, powder, which I will say a little later;
and if the burn has changed, put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by stitching, as I will say in wounds of the belly, of the side.
If the wound is exposed bone, and hangs, and only holds on by a little, cut it. Then cure the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as bread and cooked wheat, also like poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut out all the rot, and throw it away, then cure it.
And if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and you cannot stop it with medicine, find the artery, and if you find it broken, tie it with a thread; and if this does not work, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is light. and it is that you put this powder in, so that the burn heals quickly.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; living charcoal three parts, and powder it subtly, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without loosening, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses charcoal alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burn has not altered the wound.
And if the burn has altered the wound, especially if it is already there, one does not put this powder on it.
but puts on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made of water and honey, until it sheds pus; then treats it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with delicate pincers;
and I will tell you about the fractures of the head afterwards.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs on the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and put nothing constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be lukewarm, like warm washing in soft water, and mixed with rose oil, and a wash also in soft water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, then pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding results, then cauterize it, and staunch it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the food goes, then stitch the heart to the throat's bone, and do not touch the throat, but return it to its natural shape; and then restrain the swelling, and leave it for several days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then search for it; and if there are pieces of bone, then remove all that you can, and those that you cannot have, leave until the wound festers, and the exit is separated and lightened;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a lance or knife wound, and the wound is deep, observe if any wind escapes from the wound as the patient breathes: then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly because of the blood, lest it linger deeply, return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply a drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, place old cotton in the wound to absorb moisture, and keep the patient lying on the wound for three, or four, or more days; then no spasm, nor tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the veins will come; and when you see the good dispositions, know that the wound is saved. Then treat it with dressings and other remedies, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know then that there is a fistula;
if the treatment is as it should be. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, whether on the front or back, treat it like the one that is on the front. if it is large, with sutures;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is embedded in the bone, and has broken pieces, then search the wound, and draw out the splinters if they are separated; and if they are not separated, allow the wound to fester, as this will ease the extraction;
and the judgment for other wounds on other limbs is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is great, medium, and small;
From the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, causing their intrusion;
and the cure is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one puts more effort to return the intestines, if one does not return them immediately;
Because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they are more difficult to return, and therefore a medium wound is more problematic, because one returns the intestines to their place more easily than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
The two common cures occur in the cure of the belly, and the cure of other wounds of the body, and two other specific cures are common to other wounds;
And nevertheless, they are more specific to the cure of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain them.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put back, this is done by one of the two methods: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a linen cloth in just warm water, or you boil it in water with mint, cypress and spurge, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wine, and it is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water in which cooked aloes and mallows are, for by this the entry is eased with little effort;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly cut the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, that no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inside the curve and not out, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, then return it back according to the natural shape to its own place, if you have the power to, for this is better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part below the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then raise the head and chest higher than the parts below, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then direct your attention to ensuring that the injured part is higher than the other;
And thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, apply what is prepared, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
And this is the common manner of sutures, and that you take a needle or several, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave one inch of space from the head of the wound, and insert a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue, which is beneath the skin within, until you have pierced it in that part, and bring the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue together in fours;
then pull the thread doubled through the needle from two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound, and then leave an inch of space and insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not cease from doing so according to what you need from the needles, until the entire wound is bound;
and let the needles be of medium size, between subtle and large, for subtle needles cut all the flesh, and the too large ones cannot enter well: Therefore, they must be medium;
and it is not appropriate to push the needles too far into the flesh and leather, lest they cut and make the wound before the joining;
and then cut the points of the needles, so they do not wound the sick person when they sleep, and put bandages or strips at the points of the needles to keep them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of sewing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice.
The second method is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the leather and the two edges of the surface with a needle and a strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together, then bring the needle back to the starting point, in the manner in which one sews cloth;
and put a space between each stitch the width of a little finger;
This method is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than one palm in size, and two palms in size of intestines were coming out, and the wound was in the middle of his belly.
I brought back the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours out, and the wound was sewn up until fifteen days, and I healed it, and he was healthy.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and that was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with any ointment, for I was in a place where one could not find any, nor any medicines; and I would put old cotton on the wound twice a day, and wash it with honey water until he was healed.
Or I will tell you the two proper ways of sewing:
Take the needle, and bring it from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right to the right, then leave the head of the thread or stitch where you put the needle, and pierce it from the inside to the outside;
And the understanding of this sewing is that you sew as the furriers do their furs, and that you leave the thread on one side once, and take it up again on the other, until the stitching is completely finished.
The second way of sewing, which Galen properly calls, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and apply one head of the thread to the other head, in this manner:
Insert a needle into the nearby head of the thread, and pierce that spot only, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each one from the outside to the inside, at two other heads of the thread on the other side;
And that is the most common and best way of sewing.
Galen said this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, each with thread;
And one should put one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the wound fresh, with all its blood, before the heat has altered it, you return the intestine to its place and sew it;
Then put on a powder of healing material, and if the heat has altered it, put on some ointment that is available, until the wound heals; And sew the threads, and let the seams and the stitches be solid; Then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
And if you do not have medicine, immediately, as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in addition to these, when wounds are simple;
And if you fear that the wound might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak light wool in tempered oil, or in rose oil, and put it around the joints and under the armpits;
And if it feels pain or rot in the boils, and this often happens, then flush them with heated black wine, especially if the rot reaches the intestines;
and pierce it; and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called the "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the network of veins within it, and the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the septum jumps out of the wound, return it as you would the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has turned dark or black, you must tie the dark area so that blood does not flow, because there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the tie, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to ease the extraction when the septum falls and the wound is closed.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, for I saw a man who was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it became inflamed and turned into a fistula, and there issued expulsions and flatulence;
I applied treatment as best I could, and I did not cease to refine it until it was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
And some experimenters said that when a small wound is in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: take a strip of large cloth, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the strip has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it grasps its mouth upon them;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come loose, then put another strip in the same way as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn within the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a thin thread which is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this way:
take the end of this thread of intestine, which should be very thin, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and stitch the intestine, and bring it back together at the tear;
and this way of stitching with strips is no stronger than according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no device or skill, except subtlety.
of fistula or where it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old, is universally called a "fistula", and especially when it is scabbed and draining pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where no pain is felt, and is also scabbed over like the feathers of a bird;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times quite a lot;
and I have already spoken about this in the division of wounds, that any wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, is no more than by one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or by its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property of the region is slow in digestion, and delays health, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary for me to show you the cure for the fistula that is made by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that arise from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or to the skin, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some that come to the property of the principal limb, and to similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are of difficult healing, and there is only labor and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you wish to know it, take a tent of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, seek it out;
and if the fistula is crooked, seek it with a thin lead tent, for lead bends easily around the twist;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly search it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then carefully investigate as best as you can to see if there is bone or nerve, and if it is deep within, and inquire diligently of the patient about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the fault and the corrupted flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and directly in the right place, then you must cut deeply, as far as you can, and then put moistened tents in a sharp medicine, and push them as far as the head of the fistula, so that the medicine will corrode the superfluity that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve is not in the way of the main limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until the corruption is completely removed, then treat it with things that promote flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to the same condition as before, know that you have not yet reached the source.
if you uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can remove it with pliers, remove it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, remove them all, and leave not a single one;
and if the moisture resists, and there is no error or fear, then cut through the moisture and flesh, and expose the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then apply something to the wound that will cause decay, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be more easily removed;
And if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, restrain the decay only until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be cut and scraped entirely down to the corruption, and then treated until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and assistance in your work.
He was a young man around thirty years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that arose within the body, so that the matter reached the leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and there was no reason to avoid opening it;
but the physicians, in their folly, worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings appeared, which all emitted pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatments for two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called upon, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating him, and the great quantity of matter that flowed through the openings; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one ran into the other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption reached the bone itself.
I cleaned away what appeared of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, other than what I removed.
and began to restore the wound with soothing medicines for a long time, and could not heal it.
and then started again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and cleaned it, and then removed it, and struggled to heal the area. but I could not until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and saw it entirely soft, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and joined quickly, and no further work was needed except for the weakness of the sick person, who could not endure, and for the fear of death I had for him. For because of the blood evacuation he often coughed, but he was healed completely, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and was of good disposition and had no harm or opposition at all, neither in the present nor in the future.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take the splint, and apply it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and place another bandage of wool, thicker than the first splint, and place it over the flesh that is over the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the damaged flesh underneath, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to be, so that the splint does not injure the flesh;
and place a brand or a board under the bone to further cut away the damaged flesh;
and it should be done as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and repeated further times.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a brand underneath, and then a splint across the corruption from one side to the other, and let the splint be the length of the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and splint the bone on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the nail of the hand, or the nail of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nevertheless you must inquire into that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but do not allow the vein or nerve to hinder you;
and know that the instruments and blades for cutting these bones are many, according to the setting of the bones and the appearance of the bone, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore, for each type of work, you must prepare the appropriate instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the ways of illnesses; So prepare the instrument you need, as it is required.
The shoulder could be dislocated either from the inside or from the outside;
And when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and they are of no profit, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to the place where the corruption comes, so that the patient escapes death, or from the worse affliction, which is greater, of the limb's defect;
And the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems burned by fire, and after the blackness, that corruption of the limb can spread to other limbs, and it takes over the entire body;
So hurry to cut it, and if it is from the sting of some venomous creatures, like sea scorpions and vipers and the like, if the corruption is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not give it time to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corruption does not reach the arm;
And if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow.
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no powerful remedies can match the extent of its virulence.
And do exactly the same when the corruption comes to the foot. If it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint.
And if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot. And if it ascends to the leg, cut at the joint of the knee.
And if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die.
And the manner of cutting or severing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and let one assistant pull one of the ties downward, and another assistant the other tie upward, and you sever the flesh between the two ties to a width of one span, until the bone is exposed.
Then cut or sever it, and place a linen strip on each side, so that the severed part does not touch the healthy area, and cause further injury and abscess to the patient.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
He had a blackening that appeared like a burn from fire, and that corrosion first came to his toe on his foot, until it consumed the entire foot.
And when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed.
And a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling substances after cleansing his body, but the corrosion could not stop.
And he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter. And I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, because the man's strength was weak.
And he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed.
And I have recorded this only so that it may be done likewise if needed.
Sometimes an abscess forms in a fleshy area and remains so long that it gathers a large amount of pus. and then bursts and punctures, and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel. and the skin above is as thin as delicate cloths, and does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such an illness is called "sain", and not "fistula".
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, it is called "fistula".
and the skin is such that you should cut the skin all around it, especially when it is thin, like a cloth. and it does not worsen because of its corruption.
And if you are certain that the skin is inflamed, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster in this way:
Examine if the swelling is large, and the discharge from it has a foul odor, then administer a clyster of Egyptian medicine, which is made thus: Take oil, and lead, and litharge, equally, and put the mixture in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine turns red, and becomes as thick as honey;
And then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and inject it into the swelling, and press on the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by pressing;
Do this many times, until the swelling is healed, and the foul odor is gone;
And sometimes enemas of ash water are used when this medicine is unavailable.  Take ashes from a vine's wood, pour water over them, then strain it, and use the liquid as an enema, until you know the swelling is well cleansed;
And if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then give an enema of water and honey, or a small amount of powdered litharge mixed in. or you can use an enema of honey and spiced wine, as honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine dries the swelling.
And when you have done this, and are sure the swelling is cleansed, then give an enema of something that will promote flesh growth. Take a diaphinit plaster, made with rose oil and wine.
or you can give an enema with some of the medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatment of ointments.
And if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tip of the enema cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron tool, and insert a tent made of Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And if the wound is too large, suture it, leaving only the space where the enema can enter.  If the opening that discharges pus is on top, cut it at a lower point.
And if you cannot cut the swelling from underneath as you wish, arrange it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest point.  For when the pus is deep, it will not allow the flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from underneath as you wish, arrange it in this way. So that the pus runs easily downwards, and nothing of the pus remains.
So that the pus runs easily downwards, and nothing of the pus remains. And take consolidating medicines to place on the swelling, and spread a linen cloth over the entire swelling; Then cut as needed in the area of the swelling, making the opening a bit wider than the first; then spread a soft ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the swelling's opening to help drain the pus, and do not remove the large cloth until after many days, once.
And the one over the swelling's opening, remove often to remove the pus, and know what comes from the pus, whether it is venom or pus or enough, or digested, or indigested.
And watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in such a way and you see the nature rising up through the swelling's opening, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching.
Then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change the other cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health is approaching.
For there are men for whom the healing of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others who do the opposite;
And if indigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
And if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, as the ointment defines, for it contains a great deal of vitriol, and that is the last medicine;
Take ointment *dyafinit*, and it is made with rose oil, and it is sprinkled with equal parts of old wine in substance;
Then it is applied and used;
And this same thing works better when it is cooked in a larger quantity, when ointment *dyafinit* is not present, or you take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and grind it, and powder it over honey when it is over the fire;
And then in a cloth, apply it, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an experienced herbalist administers long roots and roots of the celestial lily, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; And use it of simple or compound remedies: Grind them, and make powder, and put over the honey I mentioned, and use it;
And if the healing is prolonged and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and it is pressing on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; If the treatment for the fistula is as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
And when it is old, and one does not take care of it, it becomes a large abscess, and it runs and sheds pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it runs all the way through it;
And the ulceration reaches the bone, so that there is foul pain, and the finger is swollen, and the color is foul.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not work, you must cut away all the excess remaining of the nail with a sharp knife, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone and nail are healthy;
And if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and hurt it, you must place a spatula under the nail that is hurting the flesh, and lift it up, and cut the flesh gently and subtly, and put burning and corrosive medicines on the remaining flesh to remove it all; Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it, and remove it forcefully, because as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
And if you see the finger corrupting, cut it in the middle as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
And if it is struck and bruised, and it feels great pain, you must first cleanse it;
Then cut the nail of the spatumile (presumably a type of injury) with a sharp blade, cutting across it, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
And if it happens, put something on it that soothes.
The swellings that sometimes appear in the hands of some men are sometimes all flesh, sometimes bony, and sometimes have a nail.  Some start at the joint's base, or the growth is in the bones of the fingers.
Those that arise on any part of a finger stay still, and those that grow at the finger joint may move.
The size of one that is fleshy is thus light: Cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Those that arise at the joint's root are difficult to cure: If you hold it from cutting.
In that which arises or should be at the back end, you must first cut the rounded flesh to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable blade, and then treat it until it is healed.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from the joining of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
You must cut that swelling, so that the fingers repair according to their natural shapes. Then place between two tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not grow together. Or you place between two thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is proper.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, then cut that swelling as is proper.
Visible veins, large and swollen, full of melancholic superfluities, that come to many parts of the body;
and more often happens in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should administer a purge of the bile, and then a salves of the basil.
The treatment with iron is in two ways: one is to cut them, and draw out the black blood; and the other way is that you tie off the vein, and draw out all the blood.
The incision is in this manner: First, apply a very hot water to the leg, until the thick blood is thinned, then hold the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places, with a wide incision, and raise and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much blood as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bandage it, and instruct him to eat foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harm the patient.
The raising of it is according to this method: Raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in a bath, and apply warm water to the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you have no bath, then heat it by fire, and then cut along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then scrape the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein from each side, until it appears when it is felt;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put a rake underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then scrape it lightly with a knife, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then raise it with a rake, as you did, and scrape it with another knife, as you did first;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then raise it, and cut it to the toe, then pull and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a rake underneath, and turn your hand to one side and the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put wet wool on the wound site soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must cut it crookedly, but do not cut it completely; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and it does not cut straight, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of large curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but let it be large as we have said, and this is the shape:
This vein is entangled in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes inside the body of serpents and worms, entangled between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces around it, and the knot, and let the lead hang down on the leg, and every time some comes out to the surface, wrap it around the lead, and the knot;
and if it is too long, cut off a portion, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is all out; for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh and cause an abscess and rot at the place, and a bad illness;
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five or ten palms long, and a man came to me once, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, it makes a cut or a hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing medicines to the place to prevent rot for any time, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many openings come out of it, and from which branches spring out;
Then cure it as we have said before.
of worms which grow between skin and flesh This illness is called "cowpox" in our land, because it often occurs in cows, and is a small worm which arises between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body, up and down, and one feels it well by the movement of limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and bursts forth;
and it is bred from the corruption of certain humours, just as worms and serpents and leeches and ascarides come into the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure and extract it, one can only do so when it is moving:
so you must bind the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above it and pull it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you do not find it, cauterize it with fire above, until it matures;
and the greatest harm it does is that it attacks the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it approaching the eye, tightly hold the eyebrow beneath it, then cut above it, and pull it out forcefully;
and the patient must use cleansing remedies, solutions for corrupt humors, and abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This ailment is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
And I saw that which I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it rise like a worm on the shoulder, faster than anything, like quick silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and lodged in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it was continually circling around the body, as I saw it.
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many that had pain move from one place to another, but I had never seen it like this in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and the veins exposed, and because of this the constriction appeared.
and it does not appear according to this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and filled veins.
And when you want to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then relieve it above and below quickly, and then cut above until the constricted wind in the place issues forth; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with things that dispel winds, like fetid pills, and pills of serapin, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that some have large points, and small, and barbed, and welded; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some where there are pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls then in any place of these members, and the sign of death, which I will tell you after, appears to you: so you should refrain from the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterward in many conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the sign of the brain when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the thin membrane over the brain is torn, is when scotoma, swooning, and blindness, and redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is blood flowing from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound flows white moisture, like pus, and it also flows like burning flesh;
and if these signs appear, then you should treat the injury, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The sign of an arrow when it hits the heart is that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were lodged in something hard, and not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows out, and cold comes on and cold sweat, and syncope. then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow wound in the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks the cold.
And if the arrow strikes the breast covering, it is near the ribs. and causes great pain and a great moan and gasps. and all the shoulder members move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of indigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and a bit of hay spurts out of the intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and comes forth, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, shoulder blade, spine of the back, arms, thighs, and legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to many dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I attempted it, and extracted it from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without difficulty.
And I extracted an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye beneath the eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the tip toward the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, with a light, feathered head.
The man was healed, and no ill accidents befell him.
And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab, with feathers.
I treated the wounds, and worked subtly until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted an arrow from a man, which had struck him in the belly, and I thought he would die.
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change at all; I incised over the arrow, and extracted it, and there was no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow struck him in the back, and the wound was sealed over.
and the arrow remained within him, and his natural dispositions did not change, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and the wound was sealed. and he remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And a prince of the king's men had an arrow lodged in his nose, and it was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and felt nothing. and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I applied a drawing and digestive plaster to the area so that it wouldn't swell. And the arrowhead appeared to me.
And the arrowhead appeared to me. I applied a plaster and re-closed the wound, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead within his nose one day.
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days, until it was open, and probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead sticking out of the place.
Then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrowhead became clearly visible.
And the wound remained open for about four months, and then widened so I could insert pliers, and moved it from side to side, but it would not come out.
Then I stopped searching for and experimenting with tools, until I chose the pliers, well-made, which will appear in the final part of this chapter, until I extracted it, and restored the wound.
And the experts judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I then restored it, and the wound was sutured, and the patient was completely healed.
Or I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything;
But wise masters consider even small things, and whatever is present or lacking, find new works and new instruments, concerning the treatment of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that exits through where it enters, is an arrow that penetrates fleshy parts, and sometimes exits immediately.
And if it does not exit immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotten, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is lodged in the bone, and cannot exit, leave it thus for a few days, and move it every day;
and then it will exit, and if it does not exit, pierce around it with a very thin drill, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in a hidden place in the body, so that it cannot be seen, search for it throughout the wound; and if you feel it, extract it with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot, because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves or veins, then enlarge the wound until it is large;
and extract the arrow if you can, and if there are ears on the arrow by which it is held, remove the flesh that is stuck on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the ears of the arrow until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, for you will extract it more painfully.
And if you cannot at once, leave it until the surrounding tissue is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes you uneasy, administer what we have said about the cure in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can extract the arrow without danger, quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is the greatest help there is; and if you cannot, place him according to the signs that show you.
The arrow that comes from another place, or where something appears from it, or the skin is swollen where it can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it, until the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, turn your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in there, push it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen, and you wish to administer a push, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hole of the instrument;
and then push forcibly, and if the arrow is lodged, push an instrument with a pointed end into it to make the extraction easier.
And if the arrow is embedded, you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the groin, or the belly, or the bladder, or the ribs, and it is close, and you can cut above it, cut it above.
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then remove it, and then stitch the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pincers with which arrows are drawn are similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many types of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, to push at the tip of the arrow, as here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two arteries which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two gullets which are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly lanced are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly", and is above the fossa, and is the one that is lanced, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the ulnar is the vein that is between the radial and the annular, and has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second, the saphenous, which is at the ankle of the right side; and the vein called "nerves", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
The bleeding of veins that are behind the ears helps with old colds, and with migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I told you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a vise, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places dependent from the head: then with your finger, where you feel the pulse under your finger, draw blood from there;
then take the lancet and push it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand all the way up the vein, and cut both the skin and the vein in two places with the point, and make the blood come out as much as you want;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and for habitual ophthalmia, and for acute eye inflammation.
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I say: and it is that the patient should tighten their neck, until the two veins are clearly visible; and feel the pulse beneath your finger, and then bleed from below;
then lift the heart up towards the vein above your index finger, and place the lancet beneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then release the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bandage it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the forehead vein is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for ailments of the face, and for migraines, and for redness;
and the procedure is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "a digger," of which here is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and press on it with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to flow out according to the amount you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein so that it is sound and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, it is not fitting that the flame be too sharp; and hold it sideways, for the bone is nearby, and perhaps the flame will break when it is thin.
The cautery of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts aids the eyes, and the temples, and redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the ailments of the face;
and the qualities of their cautery are that the patient tightens his neck by twisting with some bandage, as before;
then cauterize, and let the cautery be across, a little long, a little wide of the flame, because there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break.
then cause the blood to flow, as much as you need, and then bandage with cotton, and bandage it well.
The cautery of the vein in the nose is good for fever, and for sudden madness, and for facial illnesses, such as headaches and redness that come to the face, especially when it is old.
And the technique of the cautery is that the patient should tighten their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long flame and place it between the lip, in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein is not easily seen here, and the blood will begin to flow.
And do not go too deep, and cause the blood to flow according to your need, then bandage it for one night, for it will soon recover.
The cautery of the two temples helps with the constriction of the throat, and the beginning of a rash, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and sores, and herpes, and boils.
And the technique of the cautery is that the patient should tighten their neck from both sides, as we have said.
And let the master be standing over the patient's head, and let the patient sit on a chair, then cauterize the vein somewhat widely along its length, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is necessary.
Then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the ligature, and moderately constrict both veins, so that the patient does not choke. And leave it until morning, so the wound is healed.
Of the cautery of the lips Cautery of the veins in the lips above helps with a cold in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and fissures in the lips, and of the nose and throat.
And the qualities of the cautery are to make the patient sit in front of you, and constrict their neck as I have said; Then turn the lip, and look for the two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest one on each side, and likewise do with the two veins that are above and below, for it is one and the same manner.
Of the cautery under the tongue The cautery of the veins beneath the tongue aids after the cautery of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and for diseases of the mouth;
And the quality of the cautery is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts their tongue, and looks beneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cauterize one and the other, and do not go too deep, for beneath are the arteries.
The veins of the chest that are commonly cauterized are cauterized in two ways:
either by pricking with a wide, burning flame, or with a fine olive-like cutting instrument, and is called "anesil"; and are wide or fine according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the burning flame is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is useful for opening veins filled with thick, visible blood, and that contain thick, troubled blood; and this is the form of the olive-like flame:
and is more pointed, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, yellow blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps illnesses that are beneath the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the healer to bleed wisely, and that he beware of the artery which is below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it must be stopped, as I have said; And the blade should not be piercing, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilica vein is not clearly visible, then you must press on it, and choose another vein. or you wish to take a branch from it, or you bleed from the vein in the middle of the arm: it is clearly visible; and cut it with the knife, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place for bleeding, then first you must squeeze the arm, touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with a sign, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the knife; and watch that you do not strike the artery when you see the place marked, for it is from the artery: Then dry it.
And if you see it gush out upwards like a child's urine, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and put your finger on it for a while, then remove your finger if the blood stops, for this happens many times; Tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and be on guard, and let him not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is exposed, because the head will recede. and stop the blood.
And take a piece of fig bark, and split it, and take one half and bind it well over it until the other day;
if the blood stops, that's good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of it is not difficult in many positions due to the small area of the wound and the strength of the arm's binding.
The vein in the middle helps by drawing blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful around the nerve underneath, and if he pierces too deeply and finds the nerve, it swells and the patient's condition becomes severe, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve often appears, and if it does not appear in some men due to its subtlety, you should cut it with the lancet; and dry the nerve to your power.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
The surgeon of the cephalic vein helps, because it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by puncturing the olive vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, you should seek the easiest spot, and don't worry if you are not successful the first time, and try again. and perhaps the site swells in some people the first time, but that is not a problem.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be performed in one of the three veins that are on the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to the sick has no set time, but whenever necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and times;
and children should not be bled until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth to the seventh month. And the old, who have passed sixty years, should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a light clyster if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines, harmful to the main limbs;
and do not bleed those who are excessively full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are intoxicated, nor those with dropsy.
and one should beware of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and multiple labor pains in women, and from travail, from staying up late, and from fasting, and anything that depletes the strength, either through the soul or the body;
then attenuate the humors, if the blood is thick, through food and drinks and remedies, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein near the breast, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and from hardship, and from lust, and from similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the blood-letter be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt;
then the blood-letter moistens the flame with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on the vein under the area where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and some are full of gas, so that when one places the flame, it recoils from the flame, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the blood-letter must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, he begins again a little below that place or above it quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the sick person is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come there;
and do not enter the bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear that it will not release as much blood as you want, then directly apply the flame to that same opening;
and work a little quickly, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and place a little bit of oil on it, for it thins the body of the blood, and the oil is gentler in this place than the lye;
and thus apply the oil to each bleeding that you open the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and this same thing makes cracks and sores on it, when it is placed on the place; if the blood is thin and spreads when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which happens often, especially when it has not been bled sufficiently, or when the opening of the vein is small, hurry and place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt on the place, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the blood comes from the vein, and if some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm it at all; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed with the juice of calamint, or mustard, or something similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance happen with bleeding from the basilica:
Then place your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the pressure of your hand, that appearance is bad. Then be careful that you do not put on anything of what we have said, for perhaps it is cut from the artery;
but make a dry poultice to harden the place, and then cure it with another cure, until it is healed.
And draw out each drop of blood according to the quantity of its virtue, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow out until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for someone who is strong and full, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the incisions be wide.
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and they should be bled little and often, and one should bleed them by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding avoids the flow of blood and the severing of nerves, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to someone whose body weakens during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If they are feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if they are of cold complexion, give them bread soaked in syrup made with mulled wine, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if they faint during bloodletting, after the release of much blood, it is necessary that they drink broth of meat, and a subtle scented syrup, and use other things that we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm again, and bleed a second time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by the great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his continued strength.
And whoever wishes to bleed their arm again after the first bloodletting, and they have a strong body, let them bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and widen the opening so that it drips into a basin; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on their pulse when they bleed, so that death does not come instead of the basin, and this happens many times, when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not fitting when you want to untie the arm, and make blood issue the second time, and the opening is closed, that you press forcefully on it; or if it is crooked, that he stretch the arm hastily, for this would be bad;
but let it bleed the second time; or you may prick it with the point of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein issues forth, and place a little of moistened salt on it, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, let it be, and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is more composed.
And the manner of the bleeding is that the patient places their hand in warm water, until the skin is red;
then it is bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed through it, not from the width or length.
and let the puncture be wide, and bleed well near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot flow, then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough.
And if it is summer, do not return the hand to warm water, for one puts it more in winter than in summer;
And the bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there are no arteries or nerves there.
Bleeding from the vein of the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the way:
Hold the hand and place it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so one can see it; And if the bleeding is sideways, and if you cut it completely across, it won't cause harm;
And do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, stripped of flesh, and then return the hand to warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound and cannot flow out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, place oil and a cloth over the vein to quickly close it, and do so for each vein.
The bleeding from the left hand is good for mice disease, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the temples is good for all illnesses below the body, such as diseases of the marrow, and retention of humors, and diseases of the kidneys, thighs, and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in warm water and rubs the vein until it bursts, and ties the joint of the foot above. and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go up above the foot.
Bleed then in the larger vein, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, be careful of the nerves beneath, and bleed through it as if cutting.
And let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then place the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, then start again a little higher, for the place is salted.
And do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same to the sole of the other foot.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the ankle, and its bleeding is worth the pain in the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient enters a bath, and tightens above the ankle with four fingers twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear;
And if it appears, then bleed it in all the ways you can, and across it; And it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very sensitive to many hands.
And it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very sensitive to many hands. And if you do not find it, then bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
And make as much blood flow as you want, and then loosen the ligature, and place cotton on it and tighten it; It is now bled.
Cupping vessels are made of horn, or of bronze, or of glass;
And cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is on the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping on the hips; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings on the two legs; and the cuppings on the two ankles;
and the cupping draws no blood, except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this, one is not weakened, as one is from bleeding from a vein; and it is not appropriate to administer it, neither with nor without fire, in any disease that comes from repletion, until the entire body has been emptied.
And if, due to the necessity of diseases, or by custom, cupping must be administered, then let it be done each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order cupping after three hours of the day.
The leeches from the mug help the heaviness of the head... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the bleeding of the cephalic, and it is not appropriate for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
And therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And those who often bleed from it become forgetful, and for this reason, one must place the cupping a little lower out of fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilica, and therefore it is good for tightness in the chest, and for a split in the airway, and for all sorts, and for fullness;
And it should not be pressed too firmly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the second ribs of the neck is good for head aches, and eye inflammation and migraines, and for strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilica;
And you must instruct the patient to press his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery and bleeding does not occur.
Cupping below the chin is good for mouth ailments, and for gum decay, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; And it is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for ailments that come from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as cupping the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
And instruct the master not to strike too hard or too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
A cupping on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for illnesses underneath, and the cupping must be large and of bronze, for it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. And it causes great wounds there.
Cupping on the legs bleeds openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the womb, and remove the inflammation.
And they are in the place of the two shins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause paleness in many conditions.
The method of applying a cupping device is to first put it on empty, and to gently suck, and place it firmly, and move it evenly, and do not cease this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then cease, and replace the cupping devices, and take care of the condition of the bodies, for there are some who have sensitive flesh, and thin veins. If so, it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make large wounds, and somewhat deep. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to thin the thick blood's path.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
And when we wish to draw blood little by little, only one strike suffices. And if we want much blood, we begin again often;
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the result is that the heart is pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with an aperitif and dissolving oil: whether it be violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of gourd seed;
and if it is in winter, of oil of cress, or of lilies, or of chamomile, or another similar one.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amarantin oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
And if the one being treated has tender skin and wide pores, no oil should be put on, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or water of morels, or water of gourd, or water of porcelain, or another similar one.
And he who has much moisture, let him rise from ease, or from water of myrtle, and of sumac, and of similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise from old wine, or water of seuc, or decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not be bled by cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours.
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that he washes himself, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in the shade, and similar things; and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats.
and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion should take syrup of honey, and medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat pigeons and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he will be bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before the bleeding, or after, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not fitting for those who are hot to drink it.
The leeches that are placed without striking are those that are placed upon the liver, and upon the gout, and upon the belly and the flank and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not tolerate being struck upon them, and it is not done otherwise than to draw blood from member to member, as we put upon the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we put leeches on the belly and flank to soften the limb;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, thus removing the obstruction by its attractive virtue, or perhaps dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus it acts when placed upon the liver and upon the gout when there is retained wind, and these leeches are applied empty only to suck; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that the leech is filled with warm water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the leech applied with fire is thus:
And it should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have one small hole near the middle on the side, as for inserting a needle, and be of brass, smooth on the front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a cross-bar of brass or iron, for placing a lit candle, and there should be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who use them;
for the leeches of children are different from those of the old, and from those of the thin compared to the fat.
And one must thus place this leech on the limb:
take the candle of wax or ointment, and place it inside the leech through the bar that is in the leech, so that the light is at the bottom of the leech, and that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor may go forth, and one removes the leech;
and one takes the ointment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the leech then, which is administered in a pleurisy, acute, there is no bar nor opening, and is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed only on the limb;
and that is the form:
Leeches are not administered except on limbs where one cannot place leeches due to their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the toe or the nose, and other similar places;
and the quality of its use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, sweet water, free from puncture, take them;
and place them one by one in fresh water until they are full and have nothing in their bellies; and then bleed from the vein and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where a cupping can be applied, apply it, for this is very helpful.
If not, remove the area from the air, and then with water, very well, and then press it;
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it over, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is excessive, put crushed vitriol, or galena, or similar things, until it is stopped;
or you place half of shelled peas on the area, and leave them until they warm the area, it will now stop;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or you pierce it with a needle until blood flows, and then place them on, and as soon as they feel the blood, they will attach;
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a bit of crushed alum and salt, or ashes, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is for the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men mock this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letters in them.
And for this reason, the science is foreign in our land, for I have never found any good one.
and know nothing of it except through the knowledge of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have treated the science, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have here described in this chapter what is contained in it, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and remains on the truth, so that those who are tested may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or crushing comes to anyone, you should quickly bleed the patient on either side, if nothing prevents you from doing so, such as weakness of body, or if a child, or an old person; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and young deer, and drink no wine, and do not eat any fatty meats, and do not fill oneself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, lest you fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb;
then the patient returns to his former way of life.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to feed the patient foods that promote growth and viscosity, such as boiled wheat in water, and rice, and testicles, and feet, and cow's belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot easily heal or knit together according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is a treatment, to put the broken bone back in place, using large tendons which hold and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and not just any part of its work, and therefore it must be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the arm, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that go across, and others lengthwise, like the blade of a pen for writing.
For there are fractures that go across, and others lengthwise, like the blade of a pen for writing. And there are fractures with wounds, and fractures with only a small crack.
And for each kind there is its own method, and its own specific instrument in the restoration, according to what the memory brings to its place;
And a fracture of the bone is recognized by the fact that the place is twisted, and clearly shows by deformity, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound upon touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture.
But there may well be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. Therefore, you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that come afterward, and then hold it gently.
And know that the fracture that goes to the joint, and the two parts are separated, they must now be put in equal position, lest a hot abscess come.
and if a hot abscess comes, leave it for a day or so, until the abscess subsides.
Then put it in alignment as easily and wisely as you can, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces.
Then hold it, as it should be afterward.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is in two parts, whether it is the hand or foot, or in your hand if it is a small limb, or with two strings, or with one string and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring the additions back into their place as easily as you can, and be careful that through your work no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not quite right:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not constrict it too much, nor press it as those do whose work brings forth a hot abscess and contraction to the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, properly restrain the patient so that he does not move it, neither while awake nor while asleep, nor when turning, nor in any other way; and carefully guard that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain;
and carefully guard that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no crookedness comes to it when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap them with soft and subtle linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap them with a wide and hard bandage, for wide bandages embrace the entire large limb, and constrain it evenly from all sides, so that there is no blemish;
then tie around lightweight stuffing, three or four turns depending on the limb, and tighten your hand slightly on the entire bandage, then move above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture is slightly separated;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and turn it around the fractured area again;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then place linen or cloth stuffing between the bandages, until it is all even, then bandage everything over the bandage, and then place your well-made splints over it, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then place something that soothes the abscess, and removes the swelling, and leave it like that for several days;
then tighten over your splints, and let them be half the width of a skillfully cut reed, or of wood from which planks are made, or of palm fronds, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and also as long as is necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then tighten the splints just as you did in the first dressing, then tie a suitable bandage over them, just as in the first dressing over the fracture; tighter on top, gradually less so;
and the bandages should be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the bandages are thick, like the works of fools who make their dressings from twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, because the dressing cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is certainly not necessary that there be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the edges of the splints after tightening in healthy places, place linen or wool padding beneath them so that they are not injured.
When the wound is accompanied by a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to splint all broken limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, you should not put splints on it forcefully except after 5 or 7 days, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess arising.
And see here the method of ancient poultices for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains:
And it is that you take flour that is stuck to the mill walls, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common method of poultice for restoring fractures in many cases, especially for women and young children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take 3 parts of agaric, ladani, and enula, and asafoetida and gum arabic and mugat, each 10 parts. Myrrh and aloes, each 5 parts; Alechil 8 parts; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is good for many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: Take mugwort and yarrow, each 10 parts; myrrh and aloes, each 9 parts; frankincense 6 parts; Armenian bole 10 parts, and grind well, and cook with water or abundant egg, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the pain arising, and the cracking use of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in oil and cooked oil, and place on the area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly remove the pains.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of earthwort, and grind together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for the restoration of bone fracture and to diminish the remainder of the abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch, of each one part;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flax seed, balaustine, melilot, and sanicle, and flowers of violets and chamomile, of all an equal part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength except a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be between soft and hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, somewhat dry and warm things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut men's hairs, or bird's feathers, and mallow, and thistle similarly, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and watch if the patient feels no pain, nor has the bone moved from its place; if not, do not remove it for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, or lack of rest or swelling, then hurry and remove it, and take off the plaster immediately.
and take a light cloth, and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the area, until the itching ceases, and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess.
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the light bandage, and a small amount of plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all been removed, and you need plaster and bandages, then recommence them, just as you did at first.
And if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what is seen, until the fracture heals and the flesh approaches together.
then restrain it more than before, and increase its sustenance, as I said before.
and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there. apply then warm water, every time you unbind it, and every third day, and soften the bandage a little.
By this work then nourishment comes to the limb, and amends quickly what the foolish doctors do, who restore the limb crookedly.
It is bad, and such work is fearful, and I see no other remedy than to leave it alone and to work correctly.
Many kinds of fractures there are, and diverse shapes, and the causes are diverse.
For there are fractures caused by the impact of a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the soft tissue under the bone, just as does a hatchet or a log. And for this reason, this type of fracture is called "hatchet fracture".
Where the sword cuts the bone from above, piercing it, and this type of fracture is called "complete".
And the wound from these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blow-in, or a crack, or a fracture of the collarbone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or is on top of the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that penetrates the bone as thin as a hair, and the fracture is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary".
and if the wound is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and causes a piece of bone to sink in, and the place is bruised as when smiths strike their cauldrons. if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist or soft bones, like a child's head;
and happens to all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated, like splinters; and I will speak in its place.
And we know all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the examination of the surrounding tissue, and by the corrupted flesh on top.
The fractured condition is recognized by this: when the bone is exposed, and you rub along it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, loss of consciousness, stretching, sweating, acute fever, eyes bulging and reddening, and other similar symptoms in various ways, it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you do not see alarming symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, you must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue covering the brain, you must split the fractured part thus:
and you should take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and over the wound's surface as gently as possible; and if blood flows out when uncovering the bone, or a festering abscess, you should help with what is necessary, and you should fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil. and keep the wound at rest until the festering abscess is calmed, and be sure of the outflow of blood; then begin to remove the bone, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut in a narrow incision beforehand, and this is the form:
And then put another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of various incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it, before administering incisions with drills, not deep enough that they penetrate the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or circle above the point, which does not let the point pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each one comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls;
and this is the shape of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around a fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill elsewhere a little later, and do this all around, then cut with the chisels the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw the bone out with your hand, or with any of the instruments you have, such as pliers, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and drawn out the bone, you should then remove the remaining bone fragments with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or any fragments remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with poultices and ointments as we have described.
And another method of work is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and he spoke of it very strongly, and that is his word. It is necessary first to expose a part of the bone, where the break is apparent, so that when you have exposed that part, you place the head of this lancet, lenticular in shape, beneath it:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and be careful of the tissue underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, then loosen it gently, for one loosens it well without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not pierce the tissue, and the bone is only cut superficially, and there are small pieces, then you should remove the roughness, and remove the scales with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, to provide the most suitable one for each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
If first with large rasps, and afterward with finer ones, and do not cease from doing this until it is well.
In each of the other cuts, and subtle fractures, you must provide a cause according to its alignment;
and this is something not to be ignored by anyone who has devoted study to this art.
And if the surface is uncovered, then you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you don't weigh down the surface, then apply another bandage on top, and don't tie it too tightly, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the hot abscess is calmed, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and of these things, make powder, and apply to the wound, and administer other medicines without causing any harm;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave any ointment, nor allow any pus to collect, for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it will run and rot, and great harm comes to the patient;
For when one puts a corrosive substance on the surface, it will burn from above. Therefore, be aware that if any bad accident happens to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful without a doubt.
And if the blackness comes only from the medicine applied, having such power, then you should take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and mix with one drape, and place it on the surface; then treat it with the appropriate methods of treatment, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the upper nose are broken, or one part alone, for there are two bones.
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bruised or twisted, and then it heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you should put your little finger in the nostril, and bring the broken part to your index finger, and to your thumb on the outside, so that the nose returns to its natural shape. and do this gently, and watch that the patient feels no pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you should align it with the head of a slightly thick stick.
And if the break is from both sides, do the same again, and hurry to restore it the first day, if possible.
If not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has subsided, then place strips of linen on the bridge of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there. And let the strips be so thick that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some healers say that the strips should be soaked in butter, and changed each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and flour powder. Then leave the strip, until the bone is hard and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are put in the nose instead of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it. or do what you want.
And if boils come to the nose while you are working on it, put a plaster or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a little bit of diachylon.
And if boils do not come, apply a plaster on the outside, of fine flour, and incense powder, mixed with a little egg white, then place some light wool on top, and do not bind the nose.
and if the nose fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, then extract it with instruments suitable for this, then close the crack and treat the parts with things for joining flesh and welding, such as plasters and ointments suitable for it.
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead splints in it until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from below, and there is no open wound, and the fracture is only on the outside, and it is not broken in two, except for splinters inside, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you place your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your index finger of your right hand, and push the fracture inwards gently, and straighten it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides, until they are even.
And if movement or breakage of the teeth occurs, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then apply a bandage over the broken jaw, and place a double cloth on top; and place a large well-made splint, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then correct whatever has changed. and apply a poultice of mill powder with plenty of egg or sesame flour after you have removed the bandage;
and place a light wool on the poultice, and if the poultice works, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess arises, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, observe if any piece of bone has been removed; if subtle with the instruments appropriate for this.
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and nothing remains, stitch the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable dressings to it, to encourage flesh to grow until it is healed.
The forceps break many times, towards the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and is the easiest to restore;
where there is breakage with a wound.
And the work is such when the breakage is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the breakage equally with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor completion.
And if you need to extend further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and it should be large according to your needs; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the breakage equally, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps outwards, because it goes deep, then it is necessary for the patient to lie often on their back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is raised.
And then straighten the breakage with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must split it open;
and pull the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join due to any excess, then cut it with one of the incisors you have; but that you place this instrument beneath the forceps, in order to protect it.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work;
and have two handles, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, just as is the opening of the wound you have made when you have pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the opening is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, then fill the wound with lint and tents, according to its quantity.
And if hot abscesses come, soak the lint in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and place it on top.
The setting of a bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone a plaster of flour from the mill and egg white, and put light bandages on top, and put a bolster underneath the part if you need it; then take a very large bandage one palm wide, then put a double lint over the bandages and the plaster; then take a thin stick three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the stick on the fracture, and turn the bandage around the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and bring it back together from each part, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture firmly, and you clearly see that the stick does not move over the broken bone, then watch it each day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and lay the patient on their back, and put a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to lift the shoulder upward; so you will lighten the fracture from the force by lifting the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the neck, and do not untie it until evil accident comes, for up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that he needs it, and tighten and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in fewer in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and one knows it only by touch;
if you align it according to the shape of the fracture, and put it back into its natural form in every way you can;
then put on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and put over it a double cloth; then put over it a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there is any hair under the splint on any part of the shoulder, fill that hair with flax bandages, so that the splint is evenly covered;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage each day;
and whenever it softens, bind it, and put the splint back in its place if it has shifted, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when these number of days is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that moves out of place easily.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and pierces the skin, then cut open, and remove it, and do what we have said about the treatment of a fractured forearm, to soothe a hot abscess.
of the broken breastbone
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. but it often breaks on impact.
And when it is broken in the middle, it tilts downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and nausea, and perhaps vomits blood, and the ends of the broken bone protrude, and one can clearly feel it.
And the treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, and place a pillow between the shoulders, then press the shoulders together, and bring the ribs of the two sides together with your hands, and carefully try to put them in alignment in every way that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then place poultices and bandages over the slightly moistened salt, or another light substance, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, due to corrosion or itching that comes to the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the poultice, and treat whatever has occurred with the appropriate remedies;
then replace the bandage, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the breaking of the ribs
Know that the breakage of the ribs usually occurs only in the thick parts behind the back, and at the inside of the chest, and they only break because they are fragile; and one senses this well through examination at the sides.
And the restoration is that you put the breakage in alignment, as it should be. And then apply the plaster, and bind it tightly with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is leaning inwards, the patient feels very great pain and stabbing, like from a pinprick, because the bone is piercing the flesh; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a great deal of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have put great effort into it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do that, lest a hot abscess occur if it has not already. And if one has occurred, then treat it.
And some of you say that one places cupping glasses on the area, to draw out strongly, and that is seemingly reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping glass will draw out superfluities to the area because of the weakness of the disposition.
And some of you say that one should cover the area with wool moistened in warm oil, and tents are placed between the ribs to apply even pressure around it, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that they cannot bear from the bone piercing the skin, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the fractured rib, and it is necessary to place instruments underneath to guard the surface.
and then one should cut the bone, and pull it gently, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, then place cloths moistened in rose oil on the area.
and treat the area as it should be treated for an abscess, and let it lie often on its side or wherever it should be, until it is healed.
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether they will be healed or not, be aware if you see their hands softened and swollen and numb, and cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they don't feel it.
Know that it is fatal in many situations, and if they move and feel well when pressed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured if treatment is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you wish to know whether they will be healed or not, be aware if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are present as in the hands, and if there is wind and expulsion without will on the back;
and when one raises it on its stomach, there is expulsion without will. And when it is raised on its back and it wishes to sit, it cannot. Know that it is fatal: so do not labour in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come to him, the thing is less severe.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you put rose oil or egg yolk on it, until it is calmed.
then put on one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels the pain until it is healed.
And if any bone separates, it is necessary to cut over the heart; and remove the bone, then assemble the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, then treat it with a healing ointment, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the knee", put your left hand's fingertip in it, and align it to the other hand as best you can, then apply a plaster and a splint, if you need them;
then hold it, and if there is a separated bone, cut into it, and remove it, and heal the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, there is not much but a slight weakening at the head; and it breaks lengthwise and deviates inward, and pain and throbbing and swelling come to the patient at the broken place.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over, so that you are over the fracture; and know what is the fracture and the shape of it;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then put that fracture even, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it deviates inward, then make the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is apparent to you. And when you have put it in line, then put on the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or bone, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, until the limb is even. And command the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if a hot abscess comes, do not touch it until the hot abscess is calmed, and put on what we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is appropriate, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, one should restore it according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie to the two ends two cords, and raise them up, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and have a bend of wood in the middle, then hang it on some heavy object or let the attendant extend it downwards;
then let the attendant align the fracture equally with his hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that one supports the patient on his stretcher, and ties the hand to his neck, then commands two attendants that one hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other hold below with a single rope, and each extend to their side.
And if you wish the extraction to be stronger, tighten one rope below the fracture, and one above the fracture, and let each of the attendants extend to their side.
And if the fracture is near the head of the shoulder, you must put one rope in the middle beneath the armpit, and another towards the elbow, beneath the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, you must put one rope lightly, without effort, until the fracture is equal in its place, and at the elbow;
then set the fracture as is proper, and hold it tight, if no abscesses come.
And if any abscesses come, do not hold it tight for seven days, but place moistened wool in oil and rose oil, until the abscess subsides;
then hold it tight, and the manner of holding it is that you place the plaster over the fracture, then bring the arm up to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and place the bandage and hold tight over the shoulder and over the arm, so that the arm is in the proper position if nothing obstructs it, or if the bone is not dislodged.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and place a splint larger and stronger than the others over the fracture, and have one inch of space between each splint, and each splint should be large enough to extend beyond the fracture by three inches on each side.
then hold tight over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, more firmly and less as time passes.
And if you see the positioning of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time you restore the fractured limb, and you doubt a hot abscess, then let it be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, to see that itching or swelling does not appear in the area, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it heals, as we have said.
And if no such incident occurs, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion of equal wool under the shoulder, and observe each hour of the day or night that the shape of the fractured limb does not move, or that the ligaments are not softened;
if it heals by the power of medicine, and give him the food we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and as he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and leg should be recovered in forty days in all; and then it should be released and administered baths and medicinal ointments to straighten the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unreleased for 10 days or 2 months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones", of which one is smaller, and is the one that supports the thumb;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, towards the little finger;
Perhaps only the large forearm bone is broken, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm bone is broken, the restoration is light, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small forearm bone that is broken alone, then it should be lightly and gently extended, and put in line.
And if it is the large forearm bone, then it should be held more tightly.
and extend it on a cushion, and have the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie crossed over themselves, and the cushion in front of them higher, so that the patient suffers no labour.
Then let the minister extend his arm to the part below his hand, or to the ligament, and another minister to the other above.
And then let the healer put it in line, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, put each in its place, and if any are detached that pierce the heart, and you cannot restore them to their place, then cut open and remove them, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the separate chapter. So take the treatment.
And if in the beginning of the restoration there arise hot abscesses, then apply a bandage of plaster made of rose oil and white wax, that it be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the bandage subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and apply a poultice of mill-powder with abundance of egg, then place the splints, and let the splint of the fracture be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that it should have six splints, or in several positions: whether the fracture be in one of the bones, or in two;
and hold tighter over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as it recedes, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread with which it is bound be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And observe the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with warm water, until that itching is soothed;
and let the limb rest, not too tightly bound.
And then resume the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or something similar, then adjust it.
And be careful that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows, then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not untie it for twenty days.
or, around it, then he hangs his hands on his neck, and his neck is straight, and beware of movement and agitation, and sleeps on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and the complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and the sides of the fingers, few fractures occur, and many times only bending happens.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient should sit crossed-legged, and sit straight in front of him equally;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and the minister should extend the broken bones, and align them equally, until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess occurs, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is inside near the sole of the palm, make a sphere of bandages, and instruct the patient to press it against his fractured palm; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as is appropriate.
And if the fracture is outside, you must place a splint above, and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bandage the whole hand, and tie the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, put it straight, as is appropriate; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and prevent it from moving;
and if the fracture is in other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, put it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in a row, which is better, or you place a splint on it, like on the knuckle;
and be careful in the restoration and disposal of hot abscesses, and assist those who come to it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by tying a bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant extends their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other below the break.
And also if it is near the knee, then the bandage should be next to the knee, and the extension should be downward;
then the healer should align the bone with their two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then put the plaster, and bandage it, if no abscess develops there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is done in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and the thread's end should be above;
then wrap the bandage around the leg and thigh, then place over the fracture splints, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloth to make the constriction equal, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie three splints that are above, then return below to the thread's end, until you reach the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like this, so that neither an abscess nor swelling nor any other similar thing comes. And if it happens, untie it, and treat what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that prick, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, it is necessary to split the place and draw out force; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are put in it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, in this way of restoring it, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in ten days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of the constitutions.
Know that in the knee joint there is little breaking, but it often bends.
And if it breaks, it is not just a fissure, or a hole, and it happens to all wounds, and without wounds, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is that one puts together the broken ends, as close as possible, until they are assembled.
Then apply the plaster, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as required, then review all the treatments that we have described for other fractures, like a hot abscess and similar things. So treat each injury as appropriate, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg.
Know that there are two bones in the leg, one called the "tibia," and the other the "fibula.
And any fracture, as with the arm, happens in the same way, and therefore the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the treatments are the same.  And if the two bones are fractured together, the leg turns outward in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is fractured, it turns forward.
And if the larger bone is fractured, great pain is felt, and it is clearly visible. and it turns downward.
Then apply extension, and straighten it, and bandage the splints evenly;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be gentler and lighter; and adjust according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that support the leg on both sides, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap them in two places with one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle as well.  With this binding, the leg will not deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well done;
and some use a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and put the leg on it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture or where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treating it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the foot and in the toes, and there is only a cracking in several positions.
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones rising above one another, then place the patient's foot on the ground, as if he were about to walk, and then place your foot on his, where the bones are raised, and press it until they return to their place;
Then put the plaster and bandages on, and put a small board under the sole of the foot, two inches wide, then bind it tightly to the foot, after you have wrapped cloths around it and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones equal, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have described for the toes of the hand; Then put a splint along the length of the broken toe, and slightly wider, then put the board I mentioned under the foot, and bind it tightly.
And if there are two, three, or more broken toes, put a splint on each toe, according to its size, wrapped in one linen bandage, and bind the board under the foot; And let it extend over the top of the board, away from the foot's belly, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, that we have discussed; and treat each accident as appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the arm.
When the bone of a woman's nature is fractured, make her sit upright, then incline her toward the back, and have her held from behind;
then fill the woman's nature with cotton, and put in as much as it can hold;
then lift the woman upright, and slowly straighten her back, and then the cotton will rise until it reaches the opening of the nature, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do so for seven days or thereabouts: and thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a string to the opening, and place the entire bladder inside her nature; then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the nature will return to the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for several days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's hand, or woman's hand, is broken, restore it thus as we have said for the bone of the hip;
and those fractures are not hidden for those who apply themselves to it and use it, and understand my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right path of restoration: Understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or until it heals, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that it be healed now, so that the bleedings that we have described bear witness to this.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have no other thing, then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no hot abscess appears.
And if a hot abscess appears, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the exposed flesh, then it is necessary that you place it in position gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for placing it straight with your hands, then realign it with this instrument that is of iron, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and let them be round and a little thick, so that they do not bend when pressing on the limb during your work, and let them be pointed in front, and thick from the middle to the front, like this:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore it is necessary that the curved part be placed over the head of the apparent bone; and push it once, until it returns, and let them be even one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either a chisel or saw, to your ability;
then remove what remains of the bone's harshness and small splinters.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark astringent wine, and properly if it is in a condition of... and do not put a plaster or anything else that is oily on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then administer splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the break;
and many fools have done this, and have caused either death or corruption in the patient; and the constriction should be softer and gentler than with other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad accidents may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming on the wound, remove what you have put on it entirely, and put on healing ointment for wounds, such as four-herb ointment and similar ones.
And you must untie the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass and it cannot heal but returns to pus repeatedly, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a probe, and remove all those detached pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula comes to the place, or another kind of corruption, you must treat it, according to what he says in his chapter before this one.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or of the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
And if you cannot, leave it.
We often get many bruises after the injury to the break, especially when it's near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is a terrible sight. And perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, be warned if it is fresh. If he administers astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocoll, acacia, and similar others, then take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with abundant egg white or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days; and then loosen it, and begin another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind over a piece of lead well made; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation has already turned to hardness like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut over it, and remove the excess apparent matter; or you scrape it with a rasp, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to a multitude of dressings; or due to overly forceful movements, not at the proper time; or because it has little blood in its body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you make the sick person eat, and make the body supple, so that the blood is multiplied within him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and ease;
then put poultices on the limb, so that the poultice draws out the great swelling, and often bathe it with warm water, so that the swelling runs from the limb; and returns to its natural shape.
of a limb twisted after the sickness When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the limb's shape is ugly, yet it does not entirely lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say one should break the limb again, and many foolish doctors have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and torments are fresh, they should be treated with hot water, or softening herbs, like mallow leaves, roots, melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or you take ripe figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that lessen the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And gentle movement should be given to the limb every hour.
And if the twist is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with an iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incision. and put dressings and care into the treatment.
Dislocation is the issue of a joint from its place, so it cannot move, and the limb is misaligned, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When dislocation comes to someone, it must be immediately restored without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one restores it with difficulty to its place.
Therefore, it is not fitting that one move it when it is swollen: many times it causes swelling and other pains;
However, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it alone until the abscess is calmed;
then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently restore it, and treat each limb as the cure will bring it back into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are slightly pulled from their place, and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and saliva flows from the mouth that he cannot hold back, nor can he close his mouth, and wraps his tongue with the speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns through various positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reposition it quickly, and not delay.
and in such a way that the attendant holds the patient's head, and the attendant places the palm of one of his hands in the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two sides; and the other finger of the hand should be positioned outside, to put in line;
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw and move it in all directions. And the attendant straightens it until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it is both jawbones together, then warm water and oil should be applied, so as to soften them slightly;
and do not delay the repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are properly repositioned, and the patient's mouth closes well without pain, then apply moist cloths in a compress made of rose oil and wax, then bind it gently with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be supported between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor should they try to exert themselves; but should take light food, until the pain has subsided, and the jawbones are healed;
and then let them eat as they wish, and do not allow them to open their mouth for eating or drinking, until the jawbone is completely healed and healthy.
And if the two jawbones cannot be put back in place at once, and are not fully restored to their position, fever and painful swelling result, and perhaps loosening of the bowels, and perhaps the vomiting of pure phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal. and many times those who experience this die within four days.
The ribs cannot dislocate from the inside of the chest wall and from the breast, and sometimes dislocate outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, and stretches their arms out. and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tight;
and the shoulder that is towards the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates any time, then reset it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise the shoulder is reset when it is dislocated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates on the side of the socket below; and the second is on the side of the breast; and perhaps dislocates on the upper part, and this happens little;
and it does not dislocate behind, because of the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inwards, because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates below, towards the socket, especially in those with little flesh, for in these it jumps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps some men experience a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and thinks it is dislocated by this.
You must then test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is known when it is down towards the armpit, and it makes a difference between the diseased and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their side, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you will find it clearly when touching;
and this manner of dislocation is only to be reset when it is new, or if the child is sick.
And the method is that the minister raises the patient's hand upwards, then places their palms under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcefully upwards to its place; and the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it beneath; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said in a few days, then the patient should be bathed in warm water; and the minister should administer a soothing and softening poultice, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be laid on their back, and a pad of even wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the patient's heel should be placed on the pad, and the head of the shoulder should be lifted skillfully, and the patient's hand should be pulled;
and another minister should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish to see if it returns in this manner:
and you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and stand upright near the patient's side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upward, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another minister should pull the patient's arm downwards towards the stomach. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another way:
and one sticks a long brand into the ground, whose head is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but that he has soft cloths on top, and the patient lies along the length of the stick;
then his hand is extended downward to the other side firmly, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a brand of two arms of great and four fingers wide, that has a round head to be able to enter deeply under the axilla, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the stick, so that the stick does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm above the stick lengthwise, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of width, and let the hands be extended downwards, and let the body be hanging on the other side: the joint returns now.
And when it is in, in whatever manner, you must place a layer of equal wool under the armpit, then put the prepared plaster of powdered millstone, with incense and egg-white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind it under the armpit appropriately, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal sooner;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is displaced from its place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three places, as it is shown in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it dislocates after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upward, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations near the breast, or behind, are caused by pushing and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered.
and cure until he is healthy.
And if, after the healing, the limb has cracks and delays in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until the cracks are relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated in spurts, and returns in spurts.
and it is dislocated from all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not fixed, for one can see and feel it clearly. and dislocated according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can clearly see it. For the joint is dislocated, and the arm cannot bend, nor can the shoulder touch the rest of the body.
And you must reposition it before a hot abscess forms there, for if a hot abscess has formed, repositioning it will be difficult.
and perhaps it cannot be completely repositioned, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and causes more pain, and perhaps death ensues.
And the repositioning, when it is such that it can be repositioned, is that you stretch his hand with your two hands; and his arms be outstretched, and the hands of the mirror around, above, and below it, and push the joint together at its shoulder, or at the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm where it is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it with two ministers, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped it in a doubled cloth long and wide;
and when the minister has joined the joint to his hand, then anoint the joint with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, put a dry plaster over it with a bit of egg, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm at the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not properly set, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it thus for several days, until it is firmly placed; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint has been reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put a layer of fat sheep's wool on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it into the bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then put the wool back on, and then put it back into the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, put warm moist cow's hair mixed with butter on it, and bind it tightly;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, at the moment it dislocates, before the place becomes swollen or a hot abscess develops there.
And the repositioning is done by placing the affected hand on a table, and the attendant extends the hand and carefully aligns it, so that the palm is placed over the appearance of the joint, and pushing until it returns.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then have the patient place the back of their hand on a table during extension and repositioning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the attendant should place their hand over that apparent joint.
If it returns now, it is good. If not, apply soothing plasters to the abscesses, and leave it like that without re-commencing.
And if he cannot tolerate it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, the joint remains crooked.
and does no harm to the patient further than that the hand is softened, and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerve or artery is severed;
there is no other remedy but to cauterize nearby the injury, and perhaps nothing else works.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, soak it in hot water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the finger of the hand is dislocated in each direction, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is separated;
and leave it two days, and then put it straight that day;
and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it by day, and make it move, and retie it at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and likewise do this, if it is dislocated on the belly of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healthy;
and likewise do this, when it is dislocated on the other side.
of the dislocating of the shin of the back
When the shin of the back or the neck is dislocated, or there are many dislocated, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the bowels leap out involuntarily, and cannot be held, and many times certain limbs are softened, or the two thighs, or the two arms, or one.
And many times the shin moves in four directions;
that which moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you look out to see if the gilbositez came from childhood: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the ancient healers described cures with grand pronouncements, although they do not always bring great benefit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbositez that comes to the front of the breast, there is no remedy or health;
and also that which comes directly in the two sides, and one cannot cure anything except that which comes properly at the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched out on his face in a level place, and have a restraint under him, so that he does not injure himself;
then place one brand in the ground at the head firmly, and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and the knees, and the ankles;
and two assistants should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and be well held firm, the brands as we have said, and the physician should place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with the wheel that turns by hand. And you should place two brands on the patient's head, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each brand, above and below.
and have one hole in each brand, where the wheel runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each of the two brands have one turning brand, on which the cords turn, and have two small brands one palm's length on two turns, to turn the wheel;
and then tie the cord that is among the cords to the wheel towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other wheel, and each of the ministers turns their wheel on the whole cord, and the master places the pointed object evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then apply a desiccant plaster with abundance of egg, and then the bandages, and then a piece of a tablet three inches long, that covers the area of the bump and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient uses a subtle nourishment until he is healed;
And if anything comes in the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the piece that we have mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes the appearance comes in the back of the spine of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, for which there should not be any presumption: perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder only dislocations occur, and not as at other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when the sick leg is joined with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick person's knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the area next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of one who it comes to the outside, is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens in front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; However, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on the heel.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens behind, are that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The reduction of this type of dislocation is that you must see if the dislocation is old, and it remains in its position, in that case there is no cure; and it is not necessary for him to have presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hasten to turn the joint, and extend it inside and out, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand above in such a way that they place their hands under their armpits, then bind it gently with a bandage on the thigh; and another holds the head of the bandage;
and they pull upwards and downwards all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This manner of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is on the inside, you should lay the patient on their healthy side, then place the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the area under the armpit, then extend the bandage upwards towards the armpit, and towards the shoulder.
Then take another assistant, by the arms, and grasp the thick part of the diseased thigh, and extend it outwards forcefully. It will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot tighten it in this manner that we have said, you should tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft bandage around both heels and both knees, and the diseased leg should be extended two spans longer than the other.
Then be suspended from the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
Then command one attendant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, firmly embracing the thigh, for the joint will now return quickly.
And when the dislocation is in the thigh, the patient lies as we have said in the case of a swollen knee, and one bandage tightly binds the diseased leg and also the foot.
Then place two embers, one at the head and the other at the feet, then place one ember between the patient's thighs in the middle of the form. and have wet cloths spread around so that they do not injure the patient, then let each attendant stretch toward him, and the physician place the dislocation evenly to his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said for the swollen knee, and the patient lies on their healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, the sick leg must be stretched out quickly, and according to what I have said. and let the physician put his effort on the diseased joint, then press with the other hand, and stretch it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to stretch the patient downwards, nor to lift them from the ground, but it is necessary that they are as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on both hips. and lie on their face, and the sling is stretched out as we have said before, and one should press on the joint against the table; and it will be in place when the patient straightens their legs, and they are even. then join the thighs, and put on the plaster, and bind with a bandage, so that the hip does not move. and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on it.
and if you see that they are even, then bind it as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let it move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the hip, and if it does not fit snugly against their hip, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and put your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee tightly; and another assistant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that their leg fits snugly against their hip lightly;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg fit snugly against the hip, and tie them together firmly for three or four days, then release it;
and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not entirely healed, administer strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healthy.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and protrudes towards the part where it is dislocated:
The repositioning is gentle, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and have two assistants hold firmly on the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and place the foot beautifully upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then restart the work, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a stick in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistants hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot to their hands or a rope, to tie it to the top of the foot; then let each assistant stretch equally, and the stick remains between the patient's thighs to hold the patient while stretching;
then let the master place the dislocation in their hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and bandages, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves above the ankle behind, lest the bandage be too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, re-tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils arise there, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently straightened without difficulty, and it is an easy matter.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or a table completely upright, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns to place.
and when it is aligned, and nothing is apparent, place a board with two legs beneath the sole of the foot, then hold it firmly and leave it for three days, then release it. and keep it at rest until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wishes to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
So be not presumptuous in the cure, if you are not wise in the art and have not used it long, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not hasty;
and use at the beginning things to soothe the hot abscess, and leave the patient in the hand of God, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscess comes to it;
and when the limb is in place, administer things to soothe the hot abscess, and cure the wound, as is fitting, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be for you a change according to your Creator, and for the safety of your body and soul.
