When diarrhea comes from cold and moisture, so much so that the retentive and digestive power which is in the stomach and in the intestine is weakened, and cannot be treated by any means of treatment; and you see the patient suffering greatly and of strong constitution, make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been discussed previously on cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery; and four cauteries around the navel, small, with a small key-shaped cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.9038588
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, make a cautery on the wrist, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, because the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.766577
