Chapter XII.
On the elevation of painful eyelashes in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough, and painful to the eyes, then the procedure is to take a fine needle, insert a fine silk thread into it, and then tie the ends of the thread in a very delicate manner.
The length of the threads should be about the size of a palm.
Then prepare another fine thread similarly and tie its ends if you wish.
Then have the patient rest their head on your lap and be near the sunlight so that your work is visible, as this is a delicate and fine procedure.
Next, insert the needle at the root of the hair that needs treatment, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up and insert it into the conjunctiva, dealing with one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then pull your hand until the hair is removed with the conjunctiva in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the conjunctiva is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the conjunctiva downward with the thread you have prepared until the conjunctiva is removed from the upper hole.
Then you will see this with your eye's vision, for then you will remove the conjunctiva and the thread, and each will bleed and seal the eye, leaving the seal for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
If the hair is shorter, you then attach a longer hair from the natural ones, and it is elevated with it, or you leave it until it lengthens a bit, and then you lift it.
