When there is an abscess on the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain, but not too strong; and if it is in the membrane, he feels intense pain.
And then when this treatment requires the doctors, it is necessary that the patient be laid on his head; and then mark with ink the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form:
And cauterize one cautery so that the core is burned, and it comes to suppuration, so that all the pus is out; afterward treat according to the treatment of issues until he is healed; and no one should use this cautery except someone who has studied long in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have passed sometime.
Then he can operate boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
