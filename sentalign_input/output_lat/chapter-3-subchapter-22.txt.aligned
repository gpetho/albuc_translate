When, after healing, a crookedness, protrusion of the broken bone, or a knotting occurs in the limb and this distorts the shape of the limb, but does not prevent it from its natural function, then do not follow the advice of anyone who suggests breaking the limb again.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.	0.7777276
Many foolish doctors and restorers in our land have done this.	In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.	0.8099338
This procedure is indeed highly blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as it is potentially fatal.	The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.	0.70999455
But if the limp and knotting are recent, then they should be massaged with warm water in which softening herbs, like marshmallow leaves and root, and sweet clover, and similar herbs, have been boiled. Apply a plaster made with a softening plaster, such as properly prepared dyachilon.	But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.	0.8108525
Or take marshmallow root mucilage, mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply it as a plaster.	Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied.	0.8292715
Or take fat figs, grind them with pigeon dung, and similar ingredients known among medicines that reduce hardening.	Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.78393275
Sometimes, the knotting loosens with gentle, prolonged, and careful rubbing done with wet hands. Move the limb in every direction at all times.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.7790258
If the crookedness is longstanding, has become strong, and has turned to stone, and there is a need to treat it with metal tools, then it is necessary to cut above it, to separate the bone union, and to remove the excess from the knot or bone with fine cutting tools, applying ease and care.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.	0.7731414
