Whenever something like that happens and I wanted to treat and set it, it often resulted in death.	When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.	0.7669612
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skilled in the craft, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor bold, and he should use in the beginning only the medicines that soothe hot swellings, and surrender to the patient's condition.	Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.	0.7569761
Except what you hope for safety from damage with the mildness of the illness, and you see in it some hope, then reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs.	To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	0.62981796
If the limb returns as you intended, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with what is appropriate for it from the drying ointments. If the dislocation is with a fracture and fragments appear in the bone that are loose, then extract them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases from what preceded in their places.	If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments. If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.	0.886985
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of danger, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your reputation, God willing.	Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before. For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.	0.82815707
